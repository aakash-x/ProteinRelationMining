      "Abstract :'The sorting of transmembrane proteins (e.g., cell surface receptors) into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to the lysosomal/vacuolar lumen requires the function of the ESCRT protein complexes. The soluble coiled-coil-containing proteins Vps2, Vps20, Vps24, and Snf7 are recruited from the cytoplasm to endosomal membranes where they oligomerize into a protein complex, ESCRT-III. ESCRT-III contains two functionally distinct subcomplexes. The Vps20-Snf7 subcomplex binds to the endosomal membrane, in part via the myristoyl group of Vps20. The Vps2-Vps24 subcomplex binds to the Vps20-Snf7 complex and thereby serves to recruit additional cofactors to this site of protein sorting. We provide evidence for a role for ESCRT-III in sorting and/or concentration of MVB cargoes.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulates in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the onset of AD pathogenesis. Alterations in endosomes are among the earliest changes associated with AD but the mechanism(s) that cause endosome enlargement and the effects of MVB dysfunction on Aβ accumulation and tau pathology are incompletely understood.\\n\\nMETHODS: MVB size and Aβ fibrils in primary neurons were visualized by electron microscopy and confocal fluorescent microscopy. MVB-dysfunction, modelled by expression of dominant negative VPS4A (dnVPS4A), was analysed by biochemical methods and exosome isolation.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here we show that AD transgenic neurons have enlarged MVBs compared to wild type neurons. Uptake of exogenous Aβ also leads to enlarged MVBs in wild type neurons and generates fibril-like structures in endocytic vesicles. With time fibrillar oligomers/fibrils can extend out of the endocytic vesicles and are eventually detectable extracellularly. Further, endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components were found associated with amyloid plaques in AD transgenic mice. The phenotypes previously reported in AD transgenic neurons, with net increased intracellular levels and reduced secretion of Aβ, were mimicked by blocking recycling of ESCRT-III by dnVPS4A. DnVPS4A further resembled AD pathology by increasing tau phosphorylation at serine 396 and increasing markers of autophagy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Aβ leads to MVB enlargement and that amyloid fibres can form within the endocytic pathway of neurons. These results are consistent with the scenario of the endosome-lysosome system representing the site of initiation of Aβ aggregation. In turn, a dominant negative form of the CHMP2B-interacting protein VPS4A, which alters MVBs, leads to accumulation and aggregation of Aβ as well as tau phosphorylation, mimicking the cellular changes in AD.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Defects in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. A key step in the endocytic regulation of transmembrane proteins occurs in a subset of late-endosomal compartments known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whose formation is controlled by endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). The roles of ESCRT in dendritic maintenance and neurodegeneration remain unknown. Here, we show that mSnf7-2, a key component of ESCRT-III, is highly expressed in most mammalian neurons. Loss of mSnf7-2 in mature cortical neurons caused retraction of dendrites and neuronal cell loss. mSnf7-2 binds to CHMP2B, another ESCRT-III subunit, in which a rare dominant mutation is associated with frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). Ectopic expression of the mutant protein CHMP2B(Intron5) also caused dendritic retraction prior to neurodegeneration. CHMP2B(Intron5) was associated more avidly than CHMP2B(WT) with mSnf7-2, resulting in sequestration of mSnf7-2 in ubiquitin-positive late-endosomal vesicles in cortical neurons. Moreover, loss of mSnf7-2 or CHMP2B(Intron5) expression caused the accumulation of autophagosomes in cortical neurons and flies. These findings indicate that ESCRT-III dysfunction is associated with the autophagy pathway, suggesting a novel neurodegeneration mechanism that may have important implications for understanding FTD and other age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) are required to sort integral membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles of the multivesicular body (MVB). Mutations in the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP2B were recently associated with frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal ubiquitin-positive protein deposits in affected neurons. We show here that autophagic degradation is inhibited in cells depleted of ESCRT subunits and in cells expressing CHMP2B mutants, leading to accumulation of protein aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins, p62 and Alfy. Moreover, we find that functional MVBs are required for clearance of TDP-43 (identified as the major ubiquitinated protein in ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin deposits), and of expanded polyglutamine aggregates associated with Huntington's disease. Together, our data indicate that efficient autophagic degradation requires functional MVBs and provide a possible explanation to the observed neurodegenerative phenotype seen in patients with CHMP2B mutations.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"Abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates form paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles, a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble total tau and phospho-tau from clinically diagnosed AD patients are significantly higher compared with controls. Data from both in vitro and in vivo AD models have implied that an aberrant increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling may be a causative factor for the formation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. In the present study, we showed that in post-mortem human AD brain, tau was localized within different organelles (autophagic vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, and mitochondria). In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably carrying different genetic variants of mTor, we found a common link between the synthesis and distribution of intracellular tau. mTor overexpression or the lack of its expression was responsible for the altered balance of phosphorylated (p-)/-non phosphorylated (Np-) tau in the cytoplasm and different cellular compartments, which might facilitate tau deposition. Up-regulated mTor activity resulted in a significant increase in the amount of cytosolic tau as well as its re-localization to exocytotic vesicles that were not associated with exosomes. These results have implicated that mTor is involved in regulating tau distribution in subcellular organelles and in the initiation of tau secretion from cells to extracellular space.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and abnormally accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles; therefore, the pathways by which tau is degraded have been examined extensively. In AD brain tau is abnormally truncated at Asp(421) (tauDeltaC), which increases its fibrillogenic properties and results in compromised neuronal function. Given the fact that the accumulation of tauDeltaC is a pathogenic process in AD, in this study we examined whether full-length tau and tauDeltaC are degraded through similar or different mechanisms. To this end a tetracycline-inducible model was used to show that tauDeltaC was degraded significantly faster than full-length tau (FL-tau). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or autophagy pathways demonstrated that although FL-tau is degraded by the proteasome, tauDeltaC is cleared predominantly by macroautophagy. We also found that tauDeltaC binds C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein more efficiently than tau. This interaction leads to an increased ubiquitylation of tauDeltaC in a reconstituted in vitro assay, but surprisingly, tau (full-length or truncated) was not ubiquitylated in situ. The finding that tauDeltaC and FL-tau are differentially processed by these degradation systems provides important insights for the development of therapeutic strategies, which are focused on modulating degradation systems to preferentially clear pathological forms of the proteins.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor in the defence against oxidative stress. Here we provide evidence that activation of the Nrf2 pathway reduces the levels of phosphorylated tau by induction of an autophagy adaptor protein NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2) in neurons. The expression of NDP52, which we show has three antioxidant response elements (AREs) in its promoter region, is strongly induced by Nrf2, and its overexpression facilitates clearance of phosphorylated tau in the presence of an autophagy stimulator. In Nrf2-knockout mice, phosphorylated and sarkosyl-insoluble tau accumulates in the brains concurrent with decreased levels of NDP52. Moreover, NDP52 associates with phosphorylated tau from brain cortical samples of Alzheimer disease cases, and the amount of phosphorylated tau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is inversely proportional to that of NDP52. These results suggest that NDP52 plays a key role in autophagy-mediated degradation of phosphorylated tau in vivo.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Accumulation of tau is a critical event in several neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Pathological tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregates to form neurofibrillary tangles. The molecular mechanisms leading to tau accumulation remain unclear and more needs to be done to elucidate them. Age is a major risk factor for all tauopathies, suggesting that molecular changes contributing to the aging process may facilitate tau accumulation and represent common mechanisms across different tauopathies. Here, we use multiple animal models and complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches to show that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates tau phosphorylation and degradation. Specifically, we show that genetically increasing mTOR activity elevates endogenous mouse tau levels and phosphorylation. Complementary to it, we further demonstrate that pharmacologically reducing mTOR signaling with rapamycin ameliorates tau pathology and the associated behavioral deficits in a mouse model overexpressing mutant human tau. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that the association between mTOR and tau is linked to GSK3β and autophagy function. In summary, we show that increasing mTOR signaling facilitates tau pathology, while reducing mTOR signaling ameliorates tau pathology. Given the overwhelming evidence that reducing mTOR signaling increases lifespan and healthspan, the data presented here have profound clinical implications for aging and tauopathies and provide the molecular basis for how aging may contribute to tau pathology. Additionally, these results provide preclinical data indicating that reducing mTOR signaling may be a valid therapeutic approach for tauopathies.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The most common neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Tauopathies, which include Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick disease and cases of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, are characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and filamentous MAPT/tau protein. The pathological mechanisms involved in MAPT protein accumulation are not well understood, but a possible impairment of protein degradation pathways has been suggested. We investigated the effects of autophagy stimulation on MAPT pathology in a model tauopathy, the human mutant P301S MAPT transgenic mouse line. In the brain of the trehalose-treated mutant mice, autophagy is activated and a reduced number of neurons containing MAPT inclusions, as well as a decreased amount of insoluble MAPT, are observed. The improvement of MAPT pathology is associated with increased nerve cell survival. Moreover, MAPT inclusions colocalize with SQSTM1/p62- and LC3-positive puncta, suggesting the colocalization of MAPT aggregates with autophagic vacuoles. Autophagy is not activated in the spinal cord of the human P301S MAPT transgenic mice and neuronal survival, as well as MAPT pathology, is unaffected. This study supports a role for autophagy stimulation in the degradation of MAPT aggregates and opens new perspectives for the investigation of autophagy as a pathological mechanism involved in neurodegenerative diseases.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the world's largest source of natural fiber and dominates the global textile industry. Hybrid cotton varieties exhibit strong heterosis that confers high fiber yields, yet the genome-wide effects of artificial selection that have influenced Upland cotton during its breeding history are poorly understood. Here, we re-sequenced Upland cotton genomes and constructed a variation map of an intact breeding pedigree comprising seven elite and 19 backbone parents. Compared to wild accessions, the 26 pedigree accessions underwent strong artificial selection during domestication that has resulted in reduced genetic diversity but stronger linkage disequilibrium and higher extents of selective sweeps. In contrast to the backbone parents, the elite parents have acquired significantly improved agronomic traits, with an especially pronounced increase in the lint percentage. Notably, identify by descent (IBD) tracking revealed that the elite parents inherited abundant beneficial trait segments and loci from the backbone parents and our combined analyses led to the identification of a core genomic segment which was inherited in the elite lines from the parents Zhong 7263 and Ejing 1 and that was strongly associated with lint percentage. Additionally, SNP correlation analysis of this core segment showed that a nonsynonymous SNP (A-to-G) site in a gene encoding the cell-wall-associated receptor-like kinase 3 (GhWAKL3) protein was highly correlated with increased lint percentage. Our results substantially increase the valuable genomics resources available for future genetic and functional genomics studies of cotton and reveal insights that will facilitate yield increases in the molecular breeding of cotton.

      "Abstract :'Mounting evidence points to increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Endothelial dysfunction (loss of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in response to provasodilatory stimuli) constitutes an early pathophysiological event in atherogenesis and CVD. Both HIV-1 infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are implicated in the development of endothelial dysfunction; however, conclusions are frequently drawn from associations shown in epidemiological studies. In this narrative review of mainly in vitro and animal studies, we report on the current understanding of how various HIV-1 proteins, HIV-1-induced proinflammatory cytokines and common antiretroviral drugs directly impact vascular endothelial cells. Proposed cellular mechanisms underlying the switch to a dysfunctional state are discussed, including oxidative stress, impaired expression and regulation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and increased expression of vascular adhesion molecules. From the literature, it appears that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, linked to decreased NO bioavailability and ensuing endothelial dysfunction, may be proposed as a putative final common pathway afflicting the vascular endothelium in PLWHA. The HIV-1-proteins Tat, Gp120 and Nef in particular, the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and the antiretroviral drugs Efavirenz and Lopinavir, most commonly postulated to be primary causal agents of endothelial dysfunction, are also discussed. We conclude that, despite existing evidence from basic research papers, a significant gap remains in terms of the exact underlying cellular mechanisms involved in HIV-1 and ART induced endothelial dysfunction. Bridging this gap could help pave the way for future strategies to prevent and treat early cardiovascular changes in PLWHA.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a general plant basal defense strategy against viruses. In this study, we showed that infection by Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) triggered ROS burst in Nicotiana benthamiana and in the natural citrus host, the extent of which was virus-dose dependent. Using Agrobacterium-mediated expression of CTV-encoded proteins in N. benthamiana, we found that p33, a unique viral protein, contributed to the induction of ROS accumulation and programmed cell death. The role of p33 in CTV pathogenicity was dissected by the gene knockout and complementation in N. benthamiana. In the citrus-CTV pathosystem, deletion of the p33 open reading frame in a CTV variant resulted in a significant decrease in ROS production, compared to that of the wild type CTV, which correlated with the invasion of the mutant virus into the immature xylem tracheid cells and abnormal differentiation of the vascular system. In contrast, the wild type CTV exhibited phloem-limited distribution and minor effect on the vasculature. We conclude that the p33 protein is a CTV effector that negatively affects virus pathogenicity and suggest that the plant recognizes p33 to activate the host immune response to restrict CTV into the phloem tissue and minimize the disease syndrome.

      "Abstract :'B7 family members and their receptors play a central role in the regulation of T cell responses through T cell costimulation and coinhibition pathways that constitute very attractive targets for the development of immunotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we report that VSIG-3/IGSF11 is a ligand of B7 family member VISTA/PD-1H and inhibits human T cell functions through a novel VSIG-3/VISTA pathway. An extensive functional ELISA binding screening assay reveals that VSIG-3 does bind to the new B7 family member VISTA but does not interact with other known members of the B7 family. Under the same experimental condition, we did not observe any significant interaction between VSIG-8 and VISTA. In addition, VSIG-3 inhibits human T cell proliferation in the presence of T cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, VSIG-3 significantly reduces cytokine and chemokine production by human T cells including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-17, CCL5/Rantes, CCL3/MIP-1α, and CXCL11/I-TAC. Anti-VISTA neutralization antibodies attenuate the binding of VSIG-3 and VISTA, as well as VSIG-3 induced T cell inhibition. Thus, we have identified a novel ligand for VISTA that is able to inhibit human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. This unique VSIG-3/VISTA coinhibitory pathway may provide new strategies for the treatment of human cancers, autoimmune disorders, infection, and transplant rejection and may aid in the design of better vaccines.

      "Abstract :'Astrocytes express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) but its functions in these cells are not well defined. This study shows that the sustained exposure (8-72\\xa0h) of mouse astrocytes to NMDA decreases the expression of the functional astroglia-specific proteins, glutamine synthetase (GS), and the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and also reduces GS activity. Similar to rat astrocytes (Obara-Michlewska et al. Neurochem Int 88:20-25, 2015), the exposure of mouse astrocytes to NMDA also decreased the expression of the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1. NMDA failed to elicit the effects in those cells incubated in the absence of Ca and in those in which the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR was silenced with GluN1 siRNA. The downregulation of GS, AQP4, and Kir4.1 observed in vitro may reflect NMDAR-mediated alterations of astrocytic functions noted in central nervous system pathologies associated with increased glutamate (Glu) release and excitotoxic tissue damage.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Rett syndrome (RTT) is a postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects girls, with 95% of RTT cases resulting from mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Choline, a dietary micronutrient found in most foods, has been shown to be important for brain development and function. However, the exact effects and mechanisms are still unknown. We found that 13\\xa0mg/day (1.7\\u2009× required daily intake) of postnatal choline treatment to Mecp2-conditional knockout mice rescued not only deficits in motor coordination, but also their anxiety-like behaviour and reduced social preference. Cortical neurons in the brains of Mecp2-conditional knockout mice supplemented with choline showed enhanced neuronal morphology and increased density of dendritic spines. Modelling RTT in vitro by knocking down the expression of the MeCP2 protein with shRNA, we found that choline supplementation to MeCP2-knockdown neurons increased their soma sizes and the complexity of their dendritic arbors. Rescue of the morphological defects could lead to enhanced neurotransmission, as suggested by an observed trend of increased expression of synaptic proteins and restored miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency in choline-supplemented MeCP2-knockdown neurons. Through the use of specific inhibitors targeting each of the known physiological pathways of choline, synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline was found to be essential in bringing about the changes seen in the choline-supplemented MeCP2-knockdown neurons. Taken together, these data reveal a role of choline in modulating neuronal plasticity, possibly leading to behavioural changes, and hence, a potential for using choline to treat RTT.'\n"

      "Abstract :\"Ensemble methods are gaining more importance in structure-based approaches as single protein-ligand complexes strongly influence the outcomes of virtual screening. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling based on a single protein-ligand complex with complex feature combinations is often limited to certain chemical classes. The REPHARMBLE (receptor pharmacophore ensemble) approach presented here examines the ability of an ensemble of selected protein-ligand complexes to populate pharmacophore space in the ligand binding site, rigorously assesses the importance of pharmacophore features using Poisson statistic and information theory-based entropy calculations, and generates pharmacophore models with high probabilities. In addition, an ensemble scoring function that combines all the resultant high-scoring pharmacophore models to score molecules is derived. The REPHARMBLE approach was evaluated on ten DUD-E benchmark datasets and afforded good screening performance, as measured by receiver operating characteristic, enrichment factor and Güner-Henry score. Although one of the high-scoring models achieved superior statistical results in each dataset, the ensemble scoring function balanced the shortcomings of each model and passed with close performance measures. This approach offers a reliable way of choosing the best-scoring features to build four-feature pharmacophore queries and customize a target-biased 'pharmacophore ensemble' scoring function for subsequent virtual screening.\"\n",

The participation of HIF-1α in apoptosis has been reported in mammals, however, a little information is available on the role of HIF-1α in the progression of apoptosis in fish. In this study, to know the role of HIF-1α in the apoptosis of fish cells, we produced HIF-1α knockout Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells using a CRISPR/Cas9 vector, and a single cell clone showing a heterozygous insertion/deletion (indel) mutation (one nucleotide insertion and one nucleotide deletion in HIF-1α gene) was chosen for further experiments. To confirm the knockout of HIF-1α, cells were transfected with a hypoxia reporting vector containing hypoxic response elements (HREs). EPC cells transfected with the reporting plasmids showed significantly increased luminescence by exposure to cobalt chloride, a prolyl hydroxylases inhibitor. On the other hand, HIF-1α knockout EPC cells showed a non-responsiveness to a cobalt chloride exposure, suggesting that functional HIF-1α protein was not produced in the HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. Apoptosis progression induced by camptothecin and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection was severely inhibited by HIF-1α knockout, and the replication of VHSV was significantly retarded in HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. These results suggest that HIF-1α in EPC cells acts as a pro-apoptotic factor in the progression of apoptosis triggered by a DNA damaging agent and rhabdoviral infection.'\n",

After adjusting for confounders, the odds ratio per afamin standard deviation was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.04-2.58; p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). An afamin threshold concentration of 87.8\\xa0mg/L exhibited the best sensitivity (79.5%) and specificity (57.1%) in predicting PE. Subgroup analysis of early- and late-onset disease resulted in substantially higher afamin concentrations in women with developing late-onset PE compared to controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) with an odds ratio per afamin standard deviation of 1.62 (95% CI: 0.98-2.70; p\\u2009=\\u20090.06).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum afamin concentrations are elevated in the first trimester among patients developing PE compared to controls. Substantial differences were observed mainly among patients with late-onset PE.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Previous study revealed that microRNA (miR)-150 might function as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma partially by targeting Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 mRNA-Binding Protein 1 (IGF2BP1). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-150-IGF2BP1 axis in human osteosarcoma which remains unclear. At first, expression levels of miR-150, and IGF2BP1 mRNA and protein in 20 osteosarcoma and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues were respectively detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Then, subcellular localization and expression pattern of IGF2BP1 protein in 100 osteosarcoma tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry. Associations of miR-150/IGF2BP1 expression with various clinicopathological features and patients' prognosis were also statistically evaluated. As a result, miR-150 expression was significantly decreased, while IGF2BP1 mRNA and protein expression were dramatically increased in osteosarcoma tissues compared to matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Immunostaining of IGF2BP1 protein was localized in cytoplasm of tumor cells in osteosarcoma tissues. Statistically, low miR-150 expression and/or high IGF2BP1 protein immunoreactive score were all significantly associated with high tumor grade, presence of metastasis and recurrence, as well as poor response to chemotherapy (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Moreover, miR-150, IGF2BP1 and combined miR-150/IGF2BP1 expressions were all identified as independent prognostic factors for overall and disease-free survivals of osteosarcoma patients (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, our data suggest that miR-150 and its downstream target IGF2BP1 may be a crucial axis for the development, progression and patients' prognosis of ostesarcoma. The newly identified miR-150/IGF2BP1 axis might be a novel potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.\"\n"

To ascertain non-pathogenic nature, the isolates were screened by hemolytic activity leading to 20 non-hemolytic strains which were subjected to tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Seven different strains were selected based on their tolerance to gastrointestinal conditions. All the selected seven isolates were found to be susceptible to ampicillin and resistant to gentamicin. The phylogenetic analysis revealed three different strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, and two of Pediococcus acidilactici. The isolates exhibit different degrees of cell surface hydrophobicity (20.0-42.0%), cellular autoaggregation (5.0-41.0%), and adhesion to mucin (35.0-78.0%). The different lactic strains also possessed higher antioxidant properties (87.6-92.9%) determined in terms of free radical scavenging activity, bile salt hydrolase activity, cholesterol lowering activity (49.0-75.0%), and exopolysaccharide production. The principal component analysis (PCA) on probiotic attributes indicated that L. plantarum K90, L. fermentum K75, and L. fermentum K78 can be used as potential probiotic candidates.'\n",

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are suggested to have therapeutic potential to enhance fracture healing in such patients. Though BMP-mediated fracture healing has been well-documented in preclinical models, there has been no clinical study that demonstrated unequivocally that indeed a BMP when presented with an appropriate scaffold could provide basis for robust outcome for delayed or non-union diaphyseal bone fractures. This review presents a comprehensive insight towards the existing knowledge on the role of BMP signaling in bone formation and maintenance. Also therapeutic options based on BMP biology are discussed.A novel osteoinductive autologous bone graft substitute (ABGS) aimed to accelerate bone regeneration was developed and is currently being tested in the clinical setting. It comprises of a biologically compatible autologous carrier made from the patient's peripheral blood (autologous blood coagulum, ABC) and of rhBMP6 as an active ingredient. Such formulation circumvents the use of animal-derived materials, significantly limits inflammatory processes common in commercial bone devices and renders the carrier flexible, malleable, and injectable ensuring the ease of use. The ongoing clinical trials result will provide more detailed insights into the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bone healing effects in humans and potentially provide novel and safe therapeutic options for bone repair.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'MAIN CONCLUSION: Oleanolic acid glucuronosyltransferase (OAGT) genes synthesizing the direct precursor of oleanane-type ginsenosides were discovered. The four recombinant proteins of OAGT were able to transfer glucuronic acid at C-3 of oleanolic acid that yields oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide. Ginsenosides are the primary active components in the genus Panax, and great efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms underlying dammarane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis. However, there is limited information on oleanane-type ginsenosides. Here, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that oleanane-type ginsenosides (particularly ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin IV and IVa) are the abundant ginsenosides in Panax zingiberensis, an extremely endangered Panax species in southwest China. These ginsenosides are derived from oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide, which may be formed from oleanolic acid catalyzed by an unknown oleanolic acid glucuronosyltransferase (OAGT). Transcriptomic analysis of leaves, stems, main roots, and fibrous roots of P. zingiberensis was performed, and a total of 46,098 unigenes were obtained, including all the identified homologous genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. The most upstream genes were highly expressed in the leaves, and the UDP-glucosyltransferase genes were highly expressed in the roots. This finding indicated that the precursors of ginsenosides are mainly synthesized in the leaves and transported to different parts for the formation of particular ginsenosides. For the first time, enzyme activity assay characterized four genes (three from P. zingiberensis and one from P. japonicus var. major, another Panax species with oleanane-type ginsenosides) encoding OAGT, which particularly transfer glucuronic acid at C-3 of oleanolic acid to form oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide. Taken together, our study provides valuable genetic information for P. zingiberensis and the genes responsible for synthesizing the direct precursor of oleanane-type ginsenosides.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Mammalian hibernation is a natural process in which the brain undergoes profound adaptive changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme hypoxia and hypothermia. In addition to a virtual cessation of neural and metabolic activity, these changes include a decrease in adult neurogenesis; the retraction of neuronal dendritic trees; changes in dendritic spines and synaptic connections; fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus; and the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Furthermore, alterations of microglial cells also occur in torpor. Importantly, all of these changes are rapidly and fully reversed when the animals arouse from torpor state, with no apparent brain damage occurring. Thus, hibernating animals are excellent natural models to study different aspects of brain plasticity. The axon initial segment (AIS) is critical for the initiation of action potentials in neurons and is an efficient site for the regulation of neural activity. This specialized structure-characterized by the expression of different types of ion channels and adhesion, scaffolding and cytoskeleton proteins-is subjected to morpho-functional plastic changes upon variations in neural activity or in pathological conditions. Here, we used immunocytochemistry and 3D confocal microscopy reconstruction techniques to measure the possible morphological differences in the AIS of neocortical (layers II-III and V) and hippocampal (CA1) neurons during the hibernation of the Syrian hamster. Our results indicate that the general integrity of the AIS is resistant to the ischemia/hypoxia conditions that are characteristic of the torpor phase of hibernation. In addition, the length of the AIS significantly increased in all the regions studied-by about 16-20% in torpor animals compared to controls, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms in response to a decrease in neuronal activity during the torpor phase of hibernation. Furthermore, in double-labeling experiment, we found that the AIS in layer V of torpid animals was longer in neurons expressing phospho-tau than in those not labeled for phospho-tau. This suggests that AIS plastic changes were more marked in phospho-tau accumulating neurons. Overall, the results further emphasize that mammalian hibernation is a good physiological model to study AIS plasticity mechanisms in non-pathological conditions.'\n",

The salivary secretome was analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS). A search of the resulting data against peptide databases using the software Mascot yielded 356, 53, and 9 matched proteins from V. destructor, A. mellifera, and DWV, respectively. The saliva contained Varroa mite proteins identified as important for potential virulence to A. cerana larvae, for the inhibition of harmful microorganisms, for the utilization of bee nutrients, and for antioxidant, oxidation-reduction and detoxification functions as well as A. mellifera proteins identified as nutrients important for mite reproduction.

      "Abstract :'DEAD-Box proteins (DBPs) constitute a prominent class of RNA remodeling factors that play a role in virtually all aspects of RNA metabolism. To better define their cellular functions, deletions in the genes encoding each of the Escherichia coli DBPs were combined with mutations in genes encoding different Ribonucleases (RNases). Significantly, double-deletion strains lacking Ribonuclease R (RNase R) and either the DeaD or SrmB DBP were found to display growth defects and an enhanced accumulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments. As RNase R is known to play a key role in removing rRNA degradation products, these observations initially suggested that these two DBPs could be directly involved in the same process. However, additional investigations indicated that DeaD and SrmB-dependent rRNA breakdown is caused by delays in ribosome assembly that increase the exposure of nascent RNAs to endonucleolytic cleavage. Consistent with this notion, mutations in factors known to be important for ribosome assembly also resulted in enhanced rRNA breakdown. Additionally, significant levels of rRNA breakdown products could be visualized in growing cells even in the absence of assembly defects. These findings reveal a hitherto unappreciated mechanism of rRNA degradation under conditions of both normal and abnormal ribosome assembly.'\n",

Tumour response is highly variable; no biomarker in clinical practice has been demonstrated to reliably predict outcome. The Inflammation-Based Index (IBI), derived from serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels, predicts survival and response to treatment in patients in a number of cancer types and was therefore explored in this setting.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods: Clinico-pathological data from patients undergoing PRRT for metastatic NETs were collected at baseline and during treatment. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) with a secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis tested associations between baseline variables and their dynamic changes, and PFS and OS. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the net benefit associated with a treatment strategy determined by the baseline IBI and non-response to PRRT.\\n\\nResults: Fifty-five patients were recruited. Baseline IBI >0 was associated with inferior PFS (HR 14.2 (95% CI 5.25-38.5), p<0.001) and OS (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed an independent association between IBI and PFS (p=0.001). DCA indicated a net clinical benefit at risk thresholds between 0.03 and 0.58.\\n\\nConclusion: Baseline IBI score and its dynamic change through treatment are associated with both PFS and OS. At a risk threshold equivalent to the currently accepted rate of non-response to therapy, implementation of this easily derived score could avoid a significant number of futile treatments.

This mutation leads to an abnormal polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-3, resulting in formation of mutant ataxin-3 aggregates. Despite several attempts to develop a therapeutic option for MJD, currently there are no available therapies capable of delaying or stopping disease progression. Recently, our group reported that reducing the expression levels of mutant ataxin-3 lead to a mitigation of several MJD-related behavior and neuropathological abnormalities. Aiming a more rapid translation to the human clinics, in this study we investigate a pharmacological inhibitor of translation - cordycepin - in several preclinical models. We found that cordycepin treatment significantly reduced: i) the levels of mutant ataxin-3; ii) the neuropathological abnormalities in a lentiviral mouse model; iii) the motor and neuropathological deficits in a transgenic mouse model and iv) the number of ubiquitin aggregates in a human neural model. We hypothesize that the effect cordycepin is mediated by the increase of phosphorylated AMPK levels, which is accompanied by a reduction in the global translation levels and by a significant activation of the autophagy pathway. Overall, this study suggests that cordycepin might constitute an effective and safe therapeutic approach for MJD, and probably for the other polyglutamine diseases.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a central player in Parkinson's disease (PD) but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain unclear. It has recently been suggested that nuclear aSyn may modulate gene expression, possibly via interactions with DNA. However, the biological behavior of aSyn in the nucleus and the factors affecting its transcriptional role are not known. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying aSyn-mediated transcription deregulation by assessing its effects in the nucleus and the impact of phosphorylation in these dynamics. We found that aSyn induced severe transcriptional deregulation, including the downregulation of important cell cycle-related genes. Importantly, transcriptional deregulation was concomitant with reduced binding of aSyn to DNA. By forcing the nuclear presence of aSyn in the nucleus (aSyn-NLS), we found the accumulation of high molecular weight aSyn species altered gene expression and reduced toxicity when compared to the wild-type or exclusively cytosolic protein. Interestingly, nuclear localization of aSyn, and the effect on gene expression and cytotoxicity, was also modulated by phosphorylation on serine 129. Thus, we hypothesize that the role of aSyn on gene expression and, ultimately, toxicity, may be modulated by the phosphorylation status and nuclear presence of different aSyn species. Our findings shed new light onto the subcellular dynamics of aSyn and unveil an intricate interplay between subcellular location, phosphorylation, and toxicity, opening novel avenues for the design of future strategies for therapeutic intervention in PD and other synucleinopathies.\"\n",

We sought to determine the role of engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1) in wound healing in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the underlying pathways.\\n\\nMethods: RNA transcriptome sequencing was performed to detect the expression profiles of mRNA between inflamed tissues and corresponding non-inflamed tissues of IBD patients, followed by GEO datasets and western blot analysis. The effects of ELMO1 overexpression or knockdown on cell migration and proliferation were determined. The dependence of these effects on Rac1 was assessed using a Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) and a Rac1 pull-down assay. We identified the underlying pathways involved by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model was established to evaluate the role of ELMO1 in colonic mucosal healing.\\n\\nResults: ELMO1 was upregulated in inflamed tissues compared with corresponding non-inflamed tissues. ELMO1 overexpression increased cell migration in a Rac1-dependent manner. Depletion of ELMO1 or NSC23766 administration abolished this effect. GO analysis revealed that ELMO1 overexpression preferentially affected pathways involved in cytoskeletal regulation and wound healing, which was demonstrated by enhanced F-actin staining and increased numbers of extending lamellipodia in cells overexpressing ELMO1. In DSS-induced colitis, systemic delivery of pSin-EF2-ELMO1-Pur attenuated colonic inflammation and promoted recovery from colonic injury.

The comprehensive information about small molecules includes the details about their molecular targets (such as protein or enzyme, DNA, RNA, antisense RNA etc.), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties such as binding affinity to their targets (Kd, Ki, IC50 and EC50 if available), mode of action, log P-value, number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptors, their clinical trial status, their 2D and three-dimensional structures etc. To enrich the basic annotation of every small molecule entry present in SMMDB, it is hyperlinked to their description present in PubChem, DrugBank, PubMed and KEGG database. The annotation about their molecular targets was enriched by linking it with UniProt and GenBank and STRING database that can be utilized to study the interaction and relation between various targets involved in single neurological disease. All molecules present in the SMMDB are made available to download in single file and can be further used in establishing the SAR, structure-based drug designing as well as shape-based virtual screening for developing the novel therapeutics against neurological diseases. The scope of this database majorly covers the interest of scientific community and researchers who are engaged in putting their endeavor toward therapeutic development and investigating the pathogenic mechanism of various neurological diseases. The graphical user interface of the SMMDB is accessible on http://bsbe.iiti.ac.in/bsbe/smmdb.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: In hemodialysis (HD) patients, impaired gut barrier and alteration in microbiota in the gut is thought to increase the risk of bacterial translocation and chronic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase reactant that mediates immune responses triggered by microbial products. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of LBP, and various metabolic and inflammatory markers in HD patients. Besides, we also aim to determine its relationship among -patients with different body mass index.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 123 HD patients were stratified into three -tertiles, according to serum LBP level. The LBP and inflammatory markers were determined using immunoassay methods. A bioimpedance spectroscopy device was used for body composition measurement.\\n\\nRESULTS: The serum levels of the two proinflammatory markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, were significantly higher in patients in the upper tertile when compared with the rest of the tertiles. In HD patients, a significant positive correlation was found between serum LBP levels and CRP, IL-6, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and fasting blood glucose levels. Patients with metabolic syndrome and pre-existing cardiovascular disease had higher LBP levels than those without metabolic syndrome. Besides, obese patients were also associated with higher serum LBP levels. Multivariate regression analyses showed that IL-6 level was the strongest correlate of LBP level, followed by hsCRP level and sCD14.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that elevated plasma LBP was associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. In addition, increased LBP level was correlated positively to markers of inflammation, and sCD14 levels.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many potentially toxic molecules accumulate in the blood during hepatic dysfunction. In clinical practice, it is very difficult to remove bilirubin, the most widely studied toxin, and particularly the unconjugated form, strongly albumin-bound. The aim of this in vitro study was to assess irreversible bilirubin adsorption as a protein-bound compound marker, using Cytosorb® (Cytosorbents Corp.), a new hemoadsorption device designed to remove cytokines.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed 4 in vitro experiments, dynamic and static, with different albumin-bilirubin solutions.\\n\\nRESULTS: All experiments showed the resin's ability to break the albumin-bilirubin complex (Experiment 1, 2), leading to efficient bilirubin removal for 24 h (Removal Rate: 90% Experiment 3) with minimal albumin loss. No sign of bilirubin release from the charged resin was detected (Experiment 4).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Cytosorb® seems a promising artificial liver support, thanks to its ability to adsorb bilirubin and its proven ability to modulate the cytokines involved in hepatic dysfunction.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether gamma gap is associated with cognitive function among older adults and whether physical activity is favorably associated with cognition among those with an elevated gamma gap. Materials (Subjects) and Methods:Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used to identify 2,352 older adults, ages 60-85. The gamma gap was evaluated from subtracting albumin from total protein (i.e., Gamma Gap = Total Protein (g/dl) - Albumin (g/dl). Those at or above 3.1 g/dl (31.0 g/L) were considered to have an elevated gamma gap. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) was used to assess cognitive function tasks of pairing and free recall among participants. Participants were asked open-ended questions about participation in leisure-time physical activity over the past 30 days. Results: Those with an elevated gamma gap (DSST, 44.8) had a lower cognitive function score when compared to those without an elevated gamma gap (DSST, 50.1) (P<0.001). After adjustments, and among those with an elevated gamma gap, those meeting MVPA guidelines (vs. not) had a DSST score 6.42 units higher (β=6.42; 95% CI: 3.85-8.99; P<0.001).Conclusion:In this national sample of older adults, gamma gap was associated with cognitive function and, among those with an elevated gamma gap, meeting PA guidelines was associated with higher cognitive function. Relevant clinical implications are discussed, as gamma gap may be predictive of risk for early mortality and reduced quality of life. Experimental work is needed to investigate whether physical activity training programs are efficacious for meaningfully reducing an elevated gamma gap and preserving optimal cognitive functioning among at-risk individuals.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Ovarian cancer has resulted in over 140 000 deaths reported annually worldwide. This is often attributed to cellular changes in the microenvironment, including increased migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate metastasis. Recently, the ability of exosomes to communicate signals between cells (and promote cancer progression) has been established. In the present study, we explored the effect of exosomes on cells present in the tumour microenvironment. Exosomes were isolated from ovarian cancer cells with different invasive capacity (high = SKOV-3 and low = OVCAR-3) by differential and buoyant density centrifugation and characterised using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot, and EM. Exosome secretion was positively correlated with invasiveness of releasing cells. Proteomic analyses identified common and unique proteins between exosomes from SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 with gene ontology analyses revealing that these exosomes are involved in the regulation of cell migration. Since the tumour microenvironment contains multiple cell types, including MSCs and ECs, we examined the effect of these exosomes on MSC and EC migration.\\xa0Exosomes promoted MSC and EC migration in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of exosomes isolated from SKOV-3 on cell migration was significantly higher compared with exosomes from OVCAR-3. Thus, we suggest that exosomes from ovarian cancer cells contain a specific set of proteins that are representative of its cell of origin and the invasive capacity.'\n"

Moreover, ACPA-IgG and RF-IgM were additionally determined in HOSTAS and HC. The prevalence of autoantibodies was compared between HOA and HC and between erosive and nonerosive HOA. In HOSTAS, hand radiographs were scored (Kellgren-Lawrence, Osteoarthritis Research Society International osteophyte and joint space narrowing) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, representing inflammation, were assessed. Groups were compared using nonparametric tests.\\n\\nRESULTS: The prevalence of anti-CarP was low and not significantly different between the total HOA group and HC (6.6% vs 3.6%, p = 0.12). In HOSTAS, the prevalence of all tested autoantibodies was low (anti-CarP 7.1%, ACPA 0.8%, RF 6.1%), and there were no significant differences observed between HOA patients and HC or between erosive and nonerosive HOA. Further, radiographic damage and CRP levels were similar in anti-CarP+ and anti-CarP-, and RF+ and RF- HOSTAS patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of autoantibodies is similar in HOA patients and HC, and these autoantibodies are not associated with erosive disease, structural damage, or inflammation in patients with HOA, indicating that another mechanism is driving erosive disease.'\n",

Potential definitions include very low disease activity (VLDA), PsA Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) near remission, Disease Activity Index for PsA (DAPSA) or clinical DAPSA (cDAPSA) remission. Our aim was to investigate the proportion of patients who fulfill these definitions and how much residual active disease remained.\\n\\nMETHODS: This analysis used 2 datasets: first, trial data from the Tight Control of PsA (TICOPA) study, which included 206 patients with recent-onset (< 2 yrs) PsA receiving standard and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD); and second, an observational clinical dataset from Italy of patients receiving biological DMARD. Proportions achieving each of the 4 potential targets were calculated in each dataset and comparisons between treatment groups were performed in the TICOPA dataset. Levels of residual disease were established for key clinical domains of PsA.\\n\\nRESULTS: All measures could differentiate the TICOPA trial treatment groups (p < 0.03). Lower proportions of patients fulfilled the VLDA criteria compared to DAPSA or cDAPSA remission. PASDAS results were different between the cohorts. Residual active disease was low across all definitions although higher levels were seen in DAPSA and cDAPSA compared to VLDA, particularly for psoriasis. In all measures, the proportion with elevated C-reactive protein was similar and low.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: VLDA appears the most stringent measure. It ensures that significant active arthritis, enthesitis, and psoriasis are not present, in contrast with DAPSA and PASDAS, in which composite scores can \"hide\" active disease in some domains.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Social isolation in adolescence leads to lasting deficits in hippocampal-dependent tasks. The reported effects of isolation on learning and memory in the Morris water maze and synaptic-related proteins have been inconsistent. Moreover, the autophagy level and its effect on cognition in the isolation model are also not clear. In the present study, we did an extended isolation period up to six months to establish a stable and appropriate isolation model to investigate the cognitive changes associated with it. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was systemically administered to mice to determine the roles of autophagy activation on cognitive changes. We discovered that long-term post-weaning social isolation (L-PWSI) produced marked deficits in spatial learning and memory and inhibited CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP), but paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and input/output (I/O) curve were unaffected. The results further showed that the L-PWSI significantly decreased the protein expression levels of PSD-95, GluA1, NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus, and no significant changes in the extracellular release of glutamate and the protein expression levels of synaptophysin, synapsin I, GAP-43, NR2A and GABA. Moreover, we found that L-PWSI increased the protein expression of p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR and p62, whereas the protein levels of LC3B and Beclin1 were decreased indicating an inhibition in autophagy activity. Intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin significantly potentiated fEPSP slope and cognition-related proteins expression in the L-PWSI mice. These results therefore suggest that L-PWSI induces postsynaptic dysfunction by disrupting the interaction between AMPAR, NMDAR and PSD-95, and inhibit the autophagy activity which led to impaired spatial memory and cognitive function.'\n",

Recently, autophagy dysfunction was identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This study was designed to investigate the effect of metformin on hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in diabetic encephalopathy (DE) by regulating autophagy clearance. db/db mice were randomly divided into four groups, db/+ mice were used as control group. Twelve-week old male db/db mice received consecutive intraperitoneal injection of 200\\u202fmg/kg/d metformin or (and) 10\\u202fmg/kg/d chloroquine for eight weeks. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to test cognitive functions before the mice were euthanized. Metformin attenuated cognitive impairment in db/db mice, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, restored the impaired autophagy in diabetic mice, all of which were reversed by inhibiting of autophagy activity. In high glucose-cultured HT22 cells, metformin increased autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, metformin enhanced autophagy activity in an AMPK dependent manner. These data show that metformin may reduce tauopathy and improve cognitive impairment in db/db mice by modulating autophagy through the AMPK dependent pathway. These findings highlight metformin as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DE.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Enzymes are highly specific and selective due to their precise, intricate three-dimensional catalytic- structure. Electron transfer in enzymes normally occurs through an active-metal centers or tunneling events that are highly insulated by the surrounding globular protein structure. In case of electrochemically active enzymes/proteins, the distance between the redox-active cofactor and the electrode surface plays key role during direct communication. Therefore, the long electron-tunneling distance can be overcome by introducing mobile redox mediators such as nanostructures specially nanowires which can diffuse into and out of the enzyme active site, ferrying reducing or oxidizing equivalents with them. Therefore, nanowire-conjugated enzymes have gained great interest in the development of biosensor devices and other electrocatalytic-biological applications. Herein we present a comprehensive review about the electrochemical enzyme-based sensor using nanowires. Over the past decade, nanowires were investigated as a versatile platform for various applications including sensors and biosensors because of their high aspect ratio and a high surface-to-volume ratio. This review aimed to summarize some of the recent developments in the enzyme based sensor research that have been achieved with various metallic and non-metallic one-dimensional nanostructure i.e. nanowires. Due to low or no toxicity and biocompatibility, enzymes conjugated with nanowires are still highly specific, sensitive and biologically active. This review demonstrates the potential usability of nanowired-enzymes for the bioanalytical applications. The review includes various types of nanowires, mode of the enzyme integration or immobilization methodologies, probe modification, biosensor fabrication and real or spiked sample testing. Biosensor parameters such as linear range and sensitivity, selectivity and detection limit of reported sensors were also considered herein. We also introduce some of the new nanowire materials which have not yet been used for biosensing or biosensor application. The limitations, challenges and prospects for the use of nanowired-enzymes in electrochemical and other real-time sensing systems as well as fabrication technologies are also discussed in this review.'\n"

Genetic factors and psychological correlates are believed to contribute to the risk of suicide attempts (SA), whereas both factors are reported to exert a small effect. This study therefore tried to investigate if combination of the two aspects can enhance the explanation of variance in SA.\\n\\nMETHODS: A common variant rs7713917 in HOMER1 gene was genotyped for 333 Chinese psychiatric patients with or without SA. Multifactorial risk models comprised of this variant and psychological correlates were identified by logistic regression analysis (LRA) and Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method separately, and then evaluated for their performance by biostatistical methods.\\n\\nRESULTS: An association of A-carrier genotypes in rs7713917 with an increased risk of SA was observed (OR\\u202f=\\u202f1.79, 95% CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.08-2.98). Although with a medium effect size, this variant alone could only explain 1.9% variance of SA. Interestingly, this study was the first time to show that the association of the rs7713917 and SA was significantly mediated by the NEO conscientiousness (NEOC) dimension (p-value\\u202f=\\u202f0.002), with a greater genetic effect observed in subjects with a low NEO-C level (OR\\u202f=\\u202f2.89, 95% CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.16-7.18) but not in subjects with an average or high level. Upon the LRA method, the multifactorial risk model constituted of the two interacted factors and their interaction effect could explain up to 17.0% variance, which was almost 9-fold higher than the one explained by the rs7713917 alone. Furthermore, this model owned a higher effectiveness than the three models identified by the MDR method (p-value\\u202f<\\u202f0.0007).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study identified an effective multifactorial risk model, in which the combination of the HOMER1 variant and the NEO-C dimension could enhance explanation of the variance of SA in Chinese.

This fusion protein represents a clear therapeutic target and molecules specifically targeting SYT-SSX1 fusion protein are currently not available. In this study, SYT-SSX1 fusion protein sequence was retrieved from Uniprot and 3D structure was generated using I-TASSER modeling program. A structure based computational screening approach has been employed using Glide docking software to identify potential SYT-SSX1 small molecule inhibitors that bind to the junction region of the fusion protein. The obtained inhibitors were further filtered based on the docking score and ADME/T properties. Ten best fit compounds were chosen for in vitro studies. The anti-proliferative activities of these 10 compounds were screened in Yamato, ASKA (carries SYT-SSX1 fusion protein) and other sarcoma cell lines such as A673, 143B to understand the specificity of inhibition of the chosen compounds. The in vitro activity was compared against HEK293 cell lines. The compound 5-fluoro-3-(1-phenyl-1H-tetraazol-5-yl)-1H-indole (FPTI) was found to be selectively cytotoxic in synovial sarcoma cell lines (Yamato and ASKA) and this compound also showed insignificant anti proliferative activity on other cell lines. Further, target gene expression study confirmed that FPTI treatment down-regulated SYT-SSX1 and modulated its downstream target genes. Cell cycle analysis revealed the involvement of an apoptotic mechanism of cell death. Further experimental validations may elucidate the therapeutic potentials of FPTI against SYT-SSX1 fusion protein.'\n",

We previously evaluated the effects of in ovo exposure to TCS on the liver transcriptome of chicken embryos and proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). However, the key molecular events identified to be affected need to be verified at the protein level. Herein, we investigated the changes in the spectrum of hepatic proteins in TCS-treated chicken embryos by proteomic analysis to validate the key signaling pathways involved in the AOPs. We identified and quantified 894 unique proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. In the 0.1 (low dose), 1 (median dose), and 10\\u202fμg triclosan/g egg (high dose) groups, TCS caused significant changes in the levels of 195, 233, and 233 proteins in males and 237, 188, and 156 proteins in females, respectively (fold changes > 1.3 or < 0.7). TCS exposure modulated the expression of proteins, predominantly involved in signaling pathways of lipid and energy metabolism in both genders. Among the proteins associated with TCS metabolism in the liver, phase I (e.g., CYP2C23a) and phase II (e.g., UGT1A1) enzymes mediated by chicken xenobiotic receptor, were only induced in males. In consonance with the malondialdehyde levels, which were increased upon TCS exposure in females in a dose-dependent manner, a battery of antioxidant enzymes, notably SOD2, GST, GSTz1, and PRDX1, was decreased and SOD1 and GSTK1 were increased in the embryos. Taken together, this proteome analysis complements the transcriptome profiling reported in our previous study and authenticates the AOPs proposed for chicken embryos in ovo exposed to TCS.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Increased oxidative damage and disrupted redox signalling are consistently associated with age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Redox signalling can directly regulate biogenesis and degradation pathways and indirectly via activation of key transcription factors. Contracting skeletal muscle fibres endogenously generate free radicals (e.g. superoxide) and non-radical derivatives (e.g. hydrogen peroxide). Exercise induced redox signalling can promote beneficial adaptive responses that are disrupted by age-related redox changes. Identifying and quantifying the redox signalling pathways responsible for successful adaptation to exercise makes skeletal muscle an attractive physiological model for redox proteomic approaches. Site specific identification of the redox modification and quantification of site occupancy in the context of protein abundance remains a crucial concept for redox proteomics approaches. Notwithstanding, the technical limitations associated with skeletal muscle for proteomic analysis, we discuss current approaches for the identification and quantification of transient and stable redox modifications that have been employed to date in ageing research. We also discuss recent developments in proteomic approaches in skeletal muscle and potential implications and opportunities for investigating disrupted redox signalling in skeletal muscle ageing.'\n"

In this regard, natural products such as Streptomyces -derived agents have shown potential applications as anticancer drugs. The present study deals with evaluating the anti-carcinogenic activity of the ether extracted metabolites derived from Streptomyces on nalm-6 and molt-4 ALL cell lines. MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity effect of Streptomyces sp on nalm-6 and molt-4 cell lines. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by Flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to investigate the effect of these metabolites on the mRNA and protein expression levels of P53, Bax, and Bcl2. In both cell lines, extracted metabolites significantly inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis. Although P53, Bax mRNA and protein expressions were increased, Bcl-2 expression decreased in treated cells compared with control. In addition, the G0/G1 arrest of Nalm-6 cells was induced. These findings of this work show that the ether-extracted metabolites from Streptomyces levis ABRIINW111 can be used as an anti-carcinogenic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.'\n",

Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) has been found to be a regulator of glycolysis, however, the role of PTBP1 in drug resistance remains to be elucidated. Herein, we found that PTBP1 was highly expressed in two drug-resistant colon cancer cell lines, vincristine-resistant HCT-8 cell line (HCT-8/V) and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cell line (HCT116/L-OHP). The levels of glucose consumption and lactate production as well as expression of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) and hexokinase II (HK2) were elevated, while PKM1 level was reduced in HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells when compared with the HCT-8 and HCT116 cells. PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin, and caused reduction in glucose consumption and lactate production. PKM2 expression, but not HK2, was decreased and PKM1 expression level was increased in cells transfected with si-PTBP1. In addition, PTBP1 overexpression significantly induced glycolysis and reduced drug sensitivity, whereas the effects were attenuated by si-PKM2. Treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) also attenuated the effect of PTBP1 overexpression on drug sensitivity. In conclusion, PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of drug-resistant colon cancer cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin through repression of glycolysis. Our study provided a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in colon cancer cells.'\n",

Fibrillin microfibrils are distinctive architectural elements that are both ubiquitous in the connective tissue space and also unique, displaying tissue-specific patterns. Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) result in multiple distinct pleiotropic disorders. Most of the more than 3000 mutations known today in FBN1 cause the Marfan syndrome. Marfan mutations can occur in any of the 56 domains that compose fibrillin-1. In contrast, rare mutations in FBN1 that are confined to only certain domains cause several different types of acromelic dysplasia. These genetic disorders demonstrate that specific domains of fibrillin-1 perform roles important to musculoskeletal growth. Many of the phenotypes of acromelic dysplasias are the opposite of those found in Marfan syndrome. Knowledge of the functions and structural organization of fibrillin molecules within microfibrils is required to understand how one protein and one gene can be the basis for multiple genetic disorders.'\n",

The latter is present in hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, whose carriers have hypocholesterolemia and low incidence of coronary artery disease.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize cholesterol fractions in patients with sickle cell disease and explore the relationship among lipoproteins, varying degrees of hemolysis, and its biomarkers.\\n\\nMETHODS: We recruited 37 healthy individuals, 39 with hemoglobin SC disease, and 40 with sickle cell anemia and quantified cholesterol fractions, heme resulting from hemoglobin breakdown, and its main scavenger protein hemopexin.\\n\\nRESULTS: Hypocholesterolemia was most significant in patients with sickle cell anemia, and cholesterol levels correlated positively with hemopexin. Nevertheless, patients still had higher relative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation than healthy subjects. Analysis of lipoproteins isolated by density ultracentrifugation showed that the LDL fraction contained higher concentrations of heme than the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, whereas HDL contained more hemopexin than LDL, albeit greatly reduced in patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our findings show that the abnormally low lipoprotein levels in sickle cell anemia correlate with hemolysis markers, particularly with hemopexin concentrations, along with significant reduction of this heme scavenger in HDL fractions. This may suggest an important role for HDL in the defense against heme-induced endothelial dysfunction in hemolytic diseases.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Inflammatory markers including C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are increasingly used within research and clinical settings. Yet, varying methodologies for cleaning immunoassay data with out of range (OOR) samples may alter characteristic levels of CRP, thereby obscuring interpretation and reliability. This study investigated the influence of eight immunoassay OOR data treatment techniques on salivary CRP (sCRP) samples from at-risk adolescents. Participants from the 'Sleep and Education: learning New Skills Early' (SENSE) Study were 86 adolescents at-risk for depression (50 female), aged 14.29 years (SD\\u2009=\\u20091.04). ANOVA results showed no statistically significant differences in average morning (F(7, 590)\\u2009=\\u20091.24, p\\u2009=\\u2009.28) and evening (F(7, 599)=1.29, p\\u2009=\\u2009.25) values produced by each OOR data cleaning technique. However, varying techniques produced differences in the magnitude of Pearson's correlations between consecutive saliva samples (r's between 0.27-0.78), and influenced the significance of a sCRP diurnal pattern; two techniques produced statistically higher morning than evening sCRP levels (t(85)\\u2009=\\u20092.70, p\\u2009=\\u2009.01 and t(85)\\u2009=\\u20092.67, p\\u2009=\\u2009.01), whereas six techniques failed to find statistical differences between morning and evening sCRP levels (p's >.05). Varying techniques also produced statistically divergent associations between sCRP and age and depressive symptoms. Results from this study provide evidence for the temporal stability of sCRP among adolescents, show winsorization as an effective OOR data management technique, and highlight the influence of methodological decisions in cleaning salivary biomarker data and the need for consistency within the field.\"\n"

Saliva holds a promising future in the search for new clinical biomarkers that are easily accessible, less complex, accurate, and cost effective as well as being non-invasive.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY: We employed qualitative proteomics approach to develop discriminatory biomarker signatures from human saliva exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. Salivary proteins were analyzed and compared between age-matched healthy subjects exposed to high altitude (∼13700\\u2009ft) for seven days (HAD7) with control subjects at sea level (Normoxia) by using 2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis/Mass Spectrometry approach.\\n\\nRESULTS: Several proteins with significant differential expression were found. The up-regulated proteins were apoptosis inducing factor-2, cystatin S, cystatin SN and carbonic anhydrase 6. The down regulated proteins were polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, alpha-enolase and prolactin-inducible protein. Further confirmation of the altered proteins such as alpha enolase, carbonic anhydrase 6, prolactin-inducible protein, apoptosis inducing factor 2, cystatin S and cystatin SN were performed using immunoblotting. The expression patterns of the selected proteins observed by immunoblot were in concurrence with 2-Dimesional gel electrophoresis results, therefore affirming the authenticity of the proteomic investigation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the proof of concept of salivary biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of hypobaric hypoxia induced effects.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between dyslipidaemia and IVDD, and to identify the possible mechanism by which dyslipidaemia aggravates the degeneration of intervertebral discs.\\n\\nMETHODS: Hyperlipidaemia rats were induced, thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: normal chow diet control group (CON) and high-fat diet group (HFD) for 8 weeks. And then, a rat disc degeneration model was established, rats were divided into three experimental groups: the normal chow diet\\xa0+\\xa0sham surgery group (CON-Sham); the normal chow diet\\xa0+\\xa0needle puncture group (CON-NP); and the high-fat diet\\xa0+\\xa0needle puncture group (HFD-NP), all rats were continually fed with normal chow diet or HFD 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the discs were harvested and histomorphological analysis, immunohistochemistry staining, real-time PCR and western blot were performed for all groups.\\n\\nRESULTS: The degenerative histological score of disc in the HFD-NP group was significantly higher than the CON-NP group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed remarkable reductions in aggrecan and collagen type II expressions, and significant increases in IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-13, HIF-1α and P65 expression in the HFD-NP group. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the mRNA levels and protein expressions of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 were higher in the HFD-NP group.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperlipidaemia resulted in an exaggerated degenerative changes and altered expression and transcription of the degeneration-associated molecules in the rat disc tissue. These results raise the possibility that hyperlipidaemia may accelerate the progression of disc degeneration.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"N6-methyladenosine (mA) is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Until now, two RNA demethylases have been identified, including FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) and ALKBH5 (α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homologue 5). As a mammalian mA demethylase, ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles, and ALKBH5 may play a significant role in these biological processes. Nevertheless, no modulator of ALKBH5 has been reported. The reason for that may be the lack of in vitro assays for ALKBH5 inhibitor screening. Herein, we describe the development of two homogeneous assays for ALKBH5 using N6-methyladenosine as substrate with different principles. Using ALKBH5 recombinant, we developed a formaldehyde dehydrogenase coupled fluorescence based assay and an antibody based assay for the activity evaluation of ALKBH5. These robust coupled assays are suitable for screening ALKBH5 inhibitors in 384-well format (Z' factors of 0.74), facilitating the discovery of modulators in the quest for the regulation of biological processes.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a Parkinson's disease (PD) related gene, translocates to impaired mitochondria and drives their elimination via autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. Mitochondrial pro-fusion protein Mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) were found to be a target for Parkin mediated ubiquitination. Mfns are transmembrane GTPase embedded in the outer membrane of mitochondria, which are required on adjacent mitochondria to mediate fusion. In mammals, Mfn2 also forms complexes that are capable of tethering mitochondria to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a structural feature essential for mitochondrial energy metabolism, calcium (Ca) transfer between the organelles and Ca dependent cell death. Despite its fundamental physiological role, the molecular mechanisms that control ER-mitochondria cross talk are obscure. Ubiquitination has recently emerged as a powerful tool to modulate protein function, via regulation of protein subcellular localization and protein ability to interact with other proteins. Ubiquitination is also a reversible mechanism, which can be actively controlled by opposing ubiquitination-deubiquitination events. In this work we found that in Parkin deficient cells and parkin mutant human fibroblasts, the tether between ER and mitochondria is decreased. We identified the site of Parkin dependent ubiquitination and showed that the non-ubiquitinatable Mfn2 mutant fails to restore ER-mitochondria physical and functional interaction. Finally, we took advantage of an established in vivo model of PD to demonstrate that manipulation of ER-mitochondria tethering by expressing an ER-mitochondria synthetic linker is sufficient to rescue the locomotor deficit associated to an in vivo Drosophila model of PD.\"\n",

The MIC and MBC for DMD was 78.1 and 156.3\\u2009μg/ml, respectively. DMD also showed the ability to eliminate the clinical bacteria isolates with resistance to methicillin and vancomycin. The DNA polymerase and gyrase inhibition evoked by DMD for bacterial lethality was proposed. In the activated keratinocytes, DMD stopped the upregulation of chemokines (CCL5 and CCL17) and increased the expression of differentiation proteins (filaggrin, involucrin, and integrin β-1). Topical application of DMD facilely penetrated into the skin, with AD-like skin displaying 2.5-fold greater permeation than healthy skin. The in vivo assessment using the mouse model with OVA sensitization and MRSA inoculation revealed a reduction of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and bacterial burden by DMD by about 2- and 100-fold, respectively.

Cell viability and intracellular ROS levels were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay, respectively. Further, we investigated the substantial effects and the underlying mechanism of EDCEP, which elicited a reduction of intracellular ROS.\\n\\nRESULTS: PA and EDCEP restored the decreases of cell viability induced by DPE and also repressed the up-regulation of CYP1A1 mRNA expression induced by DPE. Interestingly, the effects of PA and EDCEP on intracellular ROS levels showed different responses. EDCEP reduced intracellular ROS levels stimulated by DPE or by exposure to HO. EDCEP suppressed the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and reduced the level carbonylated proteins in reconstructed human epidermal equivalents topically treated with DPE. EDCEP up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), γ-glutamyl cysteine synthase (γ-GCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and in addition, increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: EDCEP reduces cellular damage initiated by environmental pollutants by stimulating the intracellular defense system against ROS through the activation of Nrf2, and by interfering with AHR signaling pathway activation.\"\n",

Administration of N16 resulted in a significant increase of vertebral bone density of osteoporotic zebrafish, indicating a good effect of N16 against GIOP. Transcriptomic sequencing analysis was then performed to investigate the mechanisms of the action of N16 against GIOP. It was observed that N16 modulated the osteoporotic phenotype by up-regulating the osteoblastic characteristic genes and down-regulating the osteoclastic characteristic genes in zebrafish.'\n",

Recent studies show that immune factors present in the Ae. aegypti saliva is the hidden culprit promoting blood meal collection, suppressing host immune molecules and promoting disease establishment. This study was designed to develop a subunit vaccine using Aedes mosquito salivary proteins targeting the aforementioned Flaviviruses. Subunit vaccine was designed very precisely by combining the immunogenic B-cell epitope with CTL and HTL epitopes and also suitable adjuvant and linkers. Immunogenicity, allergenicity and physiochemical characterization were also performed for scientific validation. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies were carried out to confirm the stable affinity between the vaccine protein (3D) and TLR3 receptor. At last, in silico cloning was executed to get the subunit vaccine restriction clone into pET28a vectro to express it in microbial expression system.

Prepartum diets were formulated to provide a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) of -21 (NEG) or -2 (NEU) mEq/100 g of dry matter (NEU) with either 1.3% or 1.8% Ca. After calving, cows remained on trial through 63 d in milk (DIM) and were fed a common lactation diet. Urine pH was lower for NEG compared with NEU and tended to be lower for 1.8% Ca compared with 1.3% Ca. Fractional excretion of Ca and Mg in urine was greater for NEG than for NEU. Prepartum plasma bicarbonate was lower and P was higher for NEG compared with NEU. Prepartum plasma P and blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio was higher for 1.3% compared with 1.8% Ca. Postpartum, concentrations of plasma total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, Mg, and ionized Mg (iMg) were higher and Na was lower for NEU compared with NEG. An interaction of DCAD and Ca was observed for plasma creatinine, which was highest for cows fed NEU and 1.3% Ca compared with all other treatments. Interactions of DCAD and DIM were observed for plasma bicarbonate and iMg. Bicarbonate was higher at 3 DIM and lower at 14 DIM for NEU compared with NEG. Concentrations of iMg were higher at 1, 2, and 14 DIM for NEU compared with NEG. Interactions of Ca and DIM were observed for plasma Ca, Cl, and anion gap. Compared with cows fed 1.5% Ca, those fed 1.3% Ca had lower Ca and anion gap and higher Cl at 1 DIM and lower Cl and higher anion gap at 14 DIM. No differences were observed in body weight or body condition score due to DCAD or Ca. Prepartum dry matter intake (DMI) was lower for NEG compared with NEU and lower for 1.8% compared with 1.3% Ca. Postpartum DMI was not different among treatments. An interaction was observed for DCAD and DIM due to higher milk yield after 45 DIM for NEG compared with NEU. No differences were observed in milk component percentage or yield among treatments. There was an interaction of DIM and Ca for milk urea concentrations, which were higher at 5 wk and lower at 6 wk for 1.3% Ca compared with 1.8% Ca. These results suggest that feeding NEG prepartum alters plasma and urine mineral concentrations compared with feeding NEU and supports increased milk yield after 45 DIM. Feeding 1.8% Ca prepartum only improved plasma Ca at 1 DIM. Feeding either NEG or 1.8% Ca reduced DMI prepartum compared with NEU or 1.3% Ca.'\n"

We designed these variants on the custom part of the EuroG10K BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), which is routinely used for genomic selection analyses in French dairy cattle. To validate the effects of these candidate variants on milk composition and to estimate their effects on cheesemaking properties, a genome-wide association study was performed on milk protein, fatty acid and mineral composition, as well as on 9 cheesemaking traits (3 laboratory cheese yields, 5 coagulation traits, and milk pH). All the traits were predicted from midinfrared spectra in the Montbéliarde cow population of the Franche-Comté region. A total of 194 candidate variants located in 24 genes and 17 genomic regions were imputed on 19,862 cows with phenotypes and genotyped with either the BovineSNP50 (Illumina Inc.) or the EuroG10K BeadChip. We then tested the effect of each SNP in a mixed linear model including random polygenic effects estimated with a genomic relationship matrix. We confirm here the effects of candidate causative variants located in 17 functional candidate genes on both cheesemaking properties and milk composition traits. In each candidate gene, we identified the most plausible causative variant: 4 are missense in the ALPL, SLC26A4, CSN3, and SCD genes, 7 are located in 5'UTR (AGPAT6), 3' untranslated region (GPT), or upstream (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, PAEP, DGAT1, and PICALM) regions, and 6 are located in introns of the SLC37A1, MGST1, CSN2, BRI3BP, FASN, and ANKH genes.\"\n",

However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the relationship between EAA and milk protein synthesis have not been fully explored. This study examined the effects of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) on EAA-stimulated β-casein synthesis, cell proliferation, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) system in BMEC. First, BMEC were cultured in medium either lacking all EAA (-EAA) or that included all EAA (+EAA) for 12 h. The BMEC were then supplemented with the opposing treatments (-EAA supplemented with +EAA and vice versa) for 0 h, 10 min, 0.5 h, 1 h, 6 h, or 12 h, respectively. After the treatment-specific time allotment, proteins were collected for Western blotting. Subsequently, a 2 × 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the interactive of SARS inhibition (control or SARS inhibited) and EAA supply (+EAA or -EAA) on gene and protein abundance, cell viability, and cell cycle in BMEC. Based on the data obtained in the first experiment, the changes in protein abundance of β-casein and SARS depended on EAA treatment time in similar patterns. The protein abundance of β-casein, SARS, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related proteins, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and the mRNA abundance of cyclin D1 (CCND1, cell cycle progression marker) and marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67, cell proliferation marker) were stimulated by the presence of EAA. Correspondingly, when cells were deprived of EAA, cell proliferation and abundance of these proteins and genes were reduced overall. Moreover, the decreases in these aspects were further exacerbated by inhibiting SARS, suggesting that an interaction between EAA and SARS is important for regulating protein synthesis. The results indicated that SARS stimulated the mTOR signaling pathway when EAA were present, enhanced EAA-stimulated cell proliferation, and contributed to increased β-casein production in BMEC.'\n",

The residence time of drug-fortified liposomes in joint cavity was evaluated by intra-articular (IA) administration of the radio-labeled (Tc) liposomal formulation in the inflamed joints in rats. The cationic liposomal formulation composed of 6‑MNA (3) as an active agent, its double salt (4) with the lipid 1,2‑distearoyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as hydrogenated soyabean phospatidylcholine (HSPC) and 1,2‑dioleyloxy‑3‑trimethylammoniumpropane chloride (DOTAP) were developed using thin film hydration technique. The cryo-TEM analysis confirmed that the prepared optimized liposomal formulation (DFL-2) was a mixture of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). In addition, the TEM analysis confirmed that the prepared liposomes were of spherical in shape having liposome size in the range of 500-900\\u202fnm and zeta potential of about +30\\u202fmV. The developed cationic liposomes exhibited sustained release profile of payload of 6‑MNA for over >12\\u202fh and about five times higher retention in the inflamed animal joints after 24\\u202fh (by scintigraphy of the joints) as compared to the plain 6‑MNA solution when administered by IA route. The anti-inflammatory activity of prepared liposomal composition is evaluated by Freund's adjuvant induced arthritic model in rats. The liposomal formulation was well tolerated by all animals indicating good biocompatibility. Further, the cationic liposomal formulation treated group showed decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level in comparison to the control and the standard groups in the in vivo study. The improved efficacy of the drug-fortified liposomal formulation was due to the coupled effect of longer retention and sustained release of the active drug 6‑MNA in the joints. From the obtained results it could be concluded that the combined effect of the cationic charge on the drug-fortified liposomes and the inherent affinity of the active agent towards the synovial joint tissues, coupled with slow release of the active drug due to double salt approach at the site of administration could potentially decrease the frequency of IA drug administration. Hence such a formulation could prove to be a therapeutic boon for the management of late stage arthritis.\"\n",

The FcRaf shared most characteristic of Raf protein, such as the Raf-like Ras-binding domain (RBD), phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain (C1 domain), and catalytic domain of the serine/threonine kinases, Raf (STKc_Raf). The sequence of functional domains of Raf protein was relatively conserved. The FcRaf mRNA was detected in the tissues of gill, muscle, and hepatopancreas from normal F. chinensis. The mRNA abundance level of FcRaf in the gill was the highest, which was 2.7-fold the level in the hepatopancreas. The expression level of FcRaf was significantly (P\\u202f<\\u202f0.05) up-regulated in the tissues of gill, muscle, and hepatopancreas post WSSV-infection, which suggested that FcRaf might be involved in the interaction between F. chinensis and WSSV. Two SNP loci were identified in the ORF, one of which was a C-T mis-sense mutation, where an Ala was replaced by a Val, and induced the predicted protein secondary structure change. Considering the relatively low MAF (0.07), whether this mis-sense mutation was a detrimental mutation needs further investigation.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Better tools are necessary to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Modeling studies for regional Leishmania elimination indicate that an effective vaccine is a critical tool. Dogs are the reservoir host of L. infantum in Brazil and the Mediterranean basin, and therefore are an important target for public health interventions as well as a relevant disease model for human VL. No vaccine has been efficacious as an immunotherapy to prevent progression of already diagnostically positive individuals to symptomatic leishmaniasis. We performed a double-blinded, block-randomized, placebo-controlled, vaccine immunotherapy trial testing the efficacy of a recombinant Leishmania A2 protein, saponin-adjuvanted, vaccine, LeishTec®, in owned hunting dogs infected with L. infantum. The primary outcome was reduction of clinical progression, with reduction of mortality as a secondary outcome. Vaccination as an immunotherapy reduced the risk of progression to clinically overt leishmaniasis by 25% in asymptomatic dogs (RR: 1.33 95% C.I. 1.009-1.786 p-value: 0.0450). Receiving vaccine vs. placebo reduced all-cause mortality in younger asymptomatic dogs by 70% (RR: 3.19 95% C.I.: 1.185-8.502 p-value\\u202f=\\u202f0.0245). Vaccination of infected-healthy animals with an anti-Leishmania vaccine significantly reduced clinical progression and decreased all-cause mortality. Use of vaccination in infected-healthy dogs can be a tool for Leishmania control.'\n",

We also analyzed serum levels of tryptophan (TRP), a predictor of malnutrition, and kynurenine (KYN).\\n\\nRESULTS: Protein-deficient pigs vaccinated with oral AttHRV vaccine had lower protection rates against diarrhea post-VirHRV challenge and significantly increased fecal virus shedding titers (HIFM transplanted but not GF pigs) compared with their protein-sufficient counterparts. Reduced vaccine efficacy in protein-deficient pigs coincided with altered serum IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ responses to oral AttHRV vaccine and the suppression of multiple innate immune parameters and HRV-specific IFN-γ producing T cells post-challenge. In protein-deficient HIFM transplanted pigs, decreased serum KYN, but not TRP levels were observed throughout the experiment, suggesting an association between the altered TRP metabolism and immune responses.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings confirm the negative effects of protein deficiency, which were exacerbated in the HIFM transplanted pigs, on innate, T cell and cytokine immune responses to HRV and on vaccine efficacy, as well as on TRP-KYN metabolism.'\n",

Bath US also produced an important increase in the number of procyanidins with higher molecular mass (up to decamers) and an overall increase in the mass signal intensities in most of the detected B-type procyanidin series, as well as an important increase of the antioxidant activity of the macromolecular fraction of procyanidins.

Molecular imprinting was achieved by using metal ion coordination interactions of N‑methacryloyl‑(l)‑histidinemethylester (MAH) monomer and Cu(II) ions. MAH-Cu(II)-HSA complex was polymerized with bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs) under constant stirring at room temperature. The characterization of the MIP-cBCNFs was carried out by FTIR-ATR, SEM, contact angle measurements and surface area measurements. The adsorption experiments of HSA onto the MIP-BCNFs and NIP-BCNFs from aqueous HSA solutions were investigated in a batch system. The selectivity of the MIP-cBCNFs was investigated by using non-template human transferrin (HTR), and myoglobin (Myo). The relative selectivity coefficients of the MIP-cBCNFs were calculated as 4.73 and 3.02 for HSA/HTR and HSA/Myo molecules, respectively. In addition, the depletion of HSA from artificial human plasma was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and 2-D gel electrophoresis. As a result, it has been shown that metal ion coordination interactions contribute to specific binding of template when preparing MIP-cBCNFs for the depletion of HSA with a high adsorption capacity, significant selectivity and reusability.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been hypothesized to play a key role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the question of whether AD itself contributes to loss of BBB integrity is still uncertain, as many in-vivo studies have failed to detect signs of AD-related BBB breakdown. We hypothesize AD-related BBB damage is subtle, and that these negative results arise from a lack of measurement sensitivity. With the aim of developing a more sensitive measure of BBB breakdown, we have designed a novel MRI scanning protocol to quantify the trans-BBB exchange of endogenous water. Using this method, we detect increased BBB water permeability in a rat model of AD that is associated with reduced expression of the tight junction protein occludin. BBB permeability to MRI contrast agent, assessed using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, did not differ between transgenic and wild-type animals and was uncorrelated with occludin expression. Our data supports the occurrence of AD-related BBB breakdown, and indicates that such BBB pathology is subtle and may be undetectable using existing 'tracer leakage' methods. Our validated water-exchange MRI method provides a new powerful tool with which to study BBB damage in-vivo.\"\n"

      "Abstract :\"The saga of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) illustrates how disparate technical developments impact science. Starting with the classic 1976 Axelrod et\\xa0al. work in Biophysical Journal, FRAP (originally fluorescence photobleaching recovery) opened the door to extraction of quantitative information from photobleaching experiments, laying the experimental and theoretical groundwork for quantifying both the mobility and the mobile fraction of a labeled population of proteins. Over the ensuing years, FRAP's reach dramatically expanded, with new developments in GFP technology and turn-key confocal microscopy, which enabled measurement of protein diffusion and binding/dissociation rates in virtually every compartment within the cell. The FRAP technique and data catalyzed an exchange of ideas between biophysicists studying membrane dynamics, cell biologists focused on intracellular dynamics, and systems biologists modeling the dynamics of cell activity. The outcome transformed the field of cellular biology, leading to a fundamental rethinking of long-held theories of cellular dynamism. Here, we review the pivotal FRAP studies that made these developments and conceptual changes possible, which gave rise to current models of complex cell dynamics.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a microbial proton pump that is ubiquitous in marine environments and may play an important role in the oceanic carbon cycle. Photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore in PR leads to a series of proton transfers between specific acidic amino acid residues and the Schiff base of retinal, culminating in a proton motive force to facilitate ATP synthesis. The proton donor in a similar retinal protein, bacteriorhodopsin, acts as a latch to allow the influx of bulk water. However, it is unclear if the proton donor in PR, E108, utilizes the same latch mechanism to become internally hydrated. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to model the changes in internal hydration of the blue variant of PR during photoactivation with the proton donor in protonated and deprotonated states. We find that there is a stark contrast in the levels of internal hydration of the cytoplasmic half of PR based on the protonation state of E108. Instead of a latch mechanism, deprotonation of E108 acts as a gate, taking advantage of a nearby polar residue (S61) to promote the formation of a stable water wire from bulk cytoplasm to the retinal-binding pocket over hundreds of nanoseconds. No large-scale conformational changes occur in PR over the microsecond timescale. This subtle yet clear difference in the effect of deprotonation of the proton donor in PR may help explain why the photointermediates that involve the proton donor (i.e., M and N states) have timescales that are orders of magnitude different from the archaeal proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin. In general, our study highlights the importance of understanding how structural fluctuations lead to differences in the way that retinal proteins accomplish the same task.'\n",

In this process, the effective activation of dendritic cells by a combination of distinctly acting adjuvants and an antigen is crucial for success. While most common vaccine formulations lack the efficiency to trigger sufficient T cell responses in a therapeutic tumor treatment, nanovaccines offer unique properties to tackle that challenge. Here, we report the stepwise development of a nanocapsule for vaccination approaches, comprising a shell consisting of antigen and loaded with a superadditive adjuvant combination. In a first initial step, we identified the combination of resiquimod (R848) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) to have a superadditive stimulatory potential. Particulated in Spermine-modified dextran-nanoparticles, the dual-adjuvant maintains its superadditive character and stimulates murine dendritic cells (DC) stronger than the soluble equivalents. The second step was to evaluate a protein-based nanocapsule as suitable antigen source for the induction of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, the DC-mediated antigen-specific T cell proliferation upon treatment with nanocapsules, whose shell consists of ovalbumin (OVA), was assessed. At least, the superadditive adjuvant combination was encapsulated into OVA-nanocapsules to create the final nanovaccine. Its immunostimulatory potential for DC was extensively tested by measuring the expression of co-stimulatory surface markers, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the capability to mediate OVA-specific T cell responses. The developed nanovaccine triggers strong superadditive dendritic cell stimulation and potent antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation. Combined with a high modifiability, an excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity and an enormous loading capacity, the introduced antigen-nanocapsule provides an enormous potential for the effective delivery of superadditive adjuvant combinations, particularly when they target intracellular receptors.'\n",

To investigate the relationship between intracellular and extracellular sRNA levels on a global scale, we performed sRNA sequencing in four muscle types and serum from wild-type, dystrophic mdx, and mdx mice in which dystrophin protein expression was restored by exon skipping. Differentially abundant sRNAs were identified in serum (mapping to miRNA, small nuclear RNA [snRNA], and PIWI-interacting RNA [piRNA] loci). One novel candidate biomarker, miR-483, was increased in both mdx serum and muscle, and also elevated in DMD patient sera. Dystrophin restoration induced global shifts in miRNA (including miR-483) and snRNA-fragment abundance toward wild-type levels. Specific serum piRNA-like sRNAs also responded to exon skipping therapy. Absolute miRNA expression in muscle was positively correlated with abundance in the circulation, although multiple highly expressed miRNAs in muscle were not elevated in mdx serum, suggesting that both passive and selective release mechanisms contribute to serum miRNA levels. In conclusion, this study has revealed new insights into the sRNA biology of dystrophin deficiency and identified novel DMD biomarkers.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The current view of the neurobiology of learning and memory suggests that long-term memory (LTM) depends not only on the de novo protein synthesis but also on the synthesis of mRNA even hours after the acquisition of memory, as well as that the regulation of transcription through the histone acetylation is essential for the memory establishment. Our previous studies showed that protein synthesis inhibition around the time of training and 5-7\\u2009hours after acquisition in the insular cortex (IC) prevents the consolidation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), a well-established learning and memory paradigm in which an animal learns to associate a novel taste with nausea. However, the participation of mRNA synthesis and the epigenetic regulation through histone acetylation in this process remains unexplored. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the inhibition of transcription as well as deacetylation of histones at two temporal windows on the consolidation of CTA. Thus, immediately or seven hours after CTA acquisition animals received a microinfusion of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or MS-275 in the IC, respectively. The present results show that transcription inhibition immediately and 7\\u2009h after acquisition impairs the CTA memory consolidation, whereas the inhibition of histone deacetylation strengths this memory at those temporal windows. These findings reveal that CTA memory requires recurrent rounds of transcriptional modulation events in the IC in order to consolidate this memory trace, demonstrating that transcriptional and epigenetic modulation substantially contribute to memory-consolidation-related functions performed by a neocortical area even several hours after memory acquisition.'\n"

Respiratory chain impairment is a key feature in sporadic PD patients and there is growing evidence that links proteins encoded by PD-associated genes to disturbances in mitochondrial function. Against the backdrop of latest advances in the development of PD treatments that target mitochondria, we aim to give an overview of the literature published in the last three decades on the significance of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD. We describe the contribution of mitochondrial genome alterations and PD-associated genes to mitochondrial maintenance. We highlight mitophagy as a key mechanism in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we focus on the reciprocal interaction between alpha-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We discuss a novel trafficking pathway involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles within the context of PD and provide a synopsis of the most recently emerging topics in PD research with respect to mitochondria. This includes the relationship between mitochondria and cell-mediated immunity, the ER-mitochondria axis, sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial stress response and the role of micro RNAs in the aetiology of PD. In addition, recent studies have challenged the neuro-centric view of PD pathology, moving microglia and astrocytes into the research spotlight. Greater insights into these mechanisms may hold the key for the development of novel targeted therapies, addressing the need for a disease-modifying treatment, which has remained elusive to date.\"\n",

Four conserved Trp residues in β/γ-crystallins account for UV absorbance and thereafter fluorescence quenching to avoid photodamage. Herein we found that βB2-crystallin Trp fluorescence was greatly enhanced by the introduction of an extra unquenched Trp fluorophore by cataract-associated mutations S31W and R145W. Both mutations impaired oligomerization, decreased stability and promote thermal aggregation, while S31W was more deleterious. S31W accelerated βB2-crystallin aggregation under UV damaging conditions, whereas R145W delayed. These observations suggested that the introduction of an extra Trp fluorophore had complicated effects on βB2-crystallin stability and aggregation against various stresses.

Indeed, epidemiological studies have clearly shown that hyperglycemia is a strong and independent factor for cardiovascular disease. In addition, we have many pathophysiological studies demonstrating the direct role of hyperglycemia in the development of atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia, by stimulating protein kinase C, increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, of adhesion molecules and of endothelin-1 and, by stimulating the polyol pathway, promotes the oxidative stress. Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia leads to the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products that modify the structure of the arterial wall and, as a consequence, will increase the risk for the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, prolonged intervention studies have shown that reduction of hyperglycemia is associated with a significant decrease in the risk for major cardiovascular events. Thus, hyperglycemia is a cardiovascular risk factor which is characterized by the fact that it induces profound modifications of the arterial wall and that it is necessary to correct hyperglycemia during enough time to obtain a cardiovascular benefit.'\n",

The rabbits were equally divided into 3 groups: a control group (high-lipid diet), RAP group (high-lipid diet supplemented with rapamycin) and RAP + NAM group (high-lipid diet supplemented with rapamycin and nicotinamide). At the end of 4 weeks, the area of plaques in the aorta was determined and the protein expression of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected through hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. For in vitro study, a hypoxia model was established in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by using the chemical method (CoCl). The MTT assay, scratch assay and tube formation assay were performed to evaluate the proliferation and angiogenesis abilities of HUVECs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of SIRT1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), mTOR and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K). Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of SIRT1, HIF-1α, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-raptor and p-p70S6K.\\n\\nRESULTS: The results of the in vivo study indicated a significant inhibitory effect of rapamycin on plaque size and intraplaque angiogenesis (0.05 ± 0.02mm versus 5.44 ± 0.50mm, P < 0.05). This effect was attenuated by nicotinamide (0.76 ± 0.15mm versus 0.05 ± 0.02mm, P < 0.05). Compared with the RAP group, CD31- and VEGF-positive vessels were abundant in the RAP + NAM group. The RAP group showed lower expression of p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and HIF-1α than did the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the RAP + NAM group showed slightly higher expression of these factors than did the RAP group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the angiogenic ability of HUVECs and its significant inhibitory effects on the protein level of HIF-1α and the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the mTORC1 pathway, including mTOR, raptor and p70S6K (P < 0.05), were enhanced by cotreatment with SRT1720 and rapamycin (P < 0.05). In contrast to mTOR and SIRT1, the mRNA levels of p70S6K and HIF-1α were reduced by rapamycin (P < 0.05) and further reduced by cotreatment with SRT1720 and rapamycin.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate that SIRT1 might negatively regulate atherosclerotic angiogenesis via mTORC1 and HIF-1α signaling pathway and cointervention of SIRT1 and mTOR may serve as a crucial therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular medicine.'\n"

This study was carried out to test the effects of Xuefuzhuyu capsules (XFZY) on the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by simulated microgravity.\\n\\nMETHODS: The mass and cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle were compared in rats treated with XFZY that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (XFZY-TS group), untreated rats that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (TS group), and control rats (CON group). The expression and phosphorylation levels of key proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system were also measured.\\n\\nRESULTS: Treatment with XFZY attenuated the loss of muscle mass and cross-sectional area induced by hindlimb unloading. Western blot analysis showed that the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase/phospho-Akt (PI3K/p-Akt) pathways were down-regulated after 30 d in the TS group compared with the CON group. This effect was partly reversed by XFZY. Hindlimb unloading increased the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Caspase 12. Treatment with XFZY alleviated this increased protein expression.\\n\\nDISCUSSION: Our results suggest that XFZY could partially reverse the effects of hindlimb unloading on muscle atrophy and perhaps target the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system, possibly through the GRP78-CHOP-JNK-Caspase 12 pathway.Zhang S, Yuan M, Cheng C, Xia D, Wu S.

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: The formation of intrafusal muscle (IM) fibers and their contact with afferent proprioceptive axons is critical for construction, function, and maintenance of the stretch reflex. Many factors affect the formation of IM fibers. Finding new factors and mechanisms of IM fiber formation is essential for the reconstruction of stretch reflex arc after injury.\\n\\nMETHODS: We established a coculture system of organotypic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and dissociated skeletal muscle (SKM) cells. The formation of IM fibers was observed in this coculture system after neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) incubation.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that NRG-1β promoted outgrowth of neurites and migration of neurons from the organotypic DRG explants and that this correlated with an induction of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression. NRG-1β also increased the amount of nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers by elevating the proportion of tyrosine kinase receptor C (TrkC) phenotypic DRG neurons. In addition, we found that the effects of NRG-1β could be blocked by inhibiting ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These data imply that NRG-1β promoted neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration from the organotypic DRG explants and that this correlated with an induction of GAP-43 expression. The modulating effects of NRG-1β on TrkC DRG neuronal phenotype may link to promote IM fiber formation. The effects produced by NRG-1β in this neuromuscular coculture system provide new data for the therapeutic potential on IM fiber formation after muscle injury.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms can contribute to phenotypic differences amongst individuals, including disease risk and drug response. Characterization of genetic polymorphisms that modulate gene expression and/or protein function may facilitate the identification of the causal variants. Here, we present the architecture of genetic polymorphisms in the human genome focusing on those predicted to be potentially functional/under natural selection and the pathways that they reside.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the human genome, polymorphisms that directly affect protein sequences and potentially affect function are the most constrained variants with the lowest single-nucleotide variant (SNV) density, least population differentiation and most significant enrichment of rare alleles. SNVs which potentially alter various regulatory sites, e.g. splicing regulatory elements, are also generally under negative selection. Interestingly, genes that regulate the expression of transcription/splicing factors and histones are conserved as a higher proportion of these genes is non-polymorphic, contain ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and/or has no non-synonymous SNVs (nsSNVs)/coding INDELs. On the other hand, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are the most polymorphic with SNVs potentially affecting the binding of transcription/splicing factors and microRNAs (miRNA) exhibiting recent positive selection (RPS). The drug transporter genes carry the most number of potentially deleterious nsSNVs and exhibit signatures of RPS and/or population differentiation. These observations suggest that genes that interact with the environment are highly polymorphic and targeted by RPS.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, selective constraints are observed in coding regions, master regulator genes, and potentially functional SNVs. In contrast, genes that modulate response to the environment are highly polymorphic and under positive selection.'\n",

They are well known to express chimeric fusions of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) family members; namely, EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and EWSR1-CREB1. In addition, recent studies have suggested the presence of other fusions.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect specific rearrangements including EWSR1, ATF1, CREB1, and cAMP response element modulator (CREM) in 16 CCSST and 6 CCSLGT cases. We also used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific chimeric fusions of EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 using fresh tumor samples in available cases.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 15 of 16 CCSST cases (93.8%) had EWSR1 rearrangement, of which 11 (68.8%) also had ATF1 rearrangement, suggestive of the presence of EWSR1-ATF1 fusions. One CCSST case (6.3%) was found to have EWSR1 and CREM rearrangements, and 4 of 6 CCSLGT cases (66.7%) had EWSR1 rearrangement, of which 2 (33.3%) showed ATF1 rearrangement and the other 2 cases (33.3%) showed CREB1 rearrangement. These cases most likely had EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 fusions, respectively. RT-PCR was performed in 8 available cases, including 6 CCSSTs and 2 CCSLGTs. All CCSSTs showed EWSR1-ATF1 fusions. Among the 2 CCSLGT cases, one had EWSR1-ATF1 fusion and the other had EWSR1-CREB1 fusion.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Rearrangements of EWSR1 and ATF1 or EWSR1-ATF1 fusion were predominantly found in CCSST, whereas those of EWSR1 and CREB1 or EWSR1-CREB1 tended to be detected in CCSLGT. A novel CREM fusion was also detected in a few cases of CCSST and CCSLGT. The cases in which EWSR1 rearrangement was detected without definitive partner genes should be considered for the presence of CREM rearrangement.'\n"

This study investigates the effects of 8-week regular exercise training in rats together with dietary CrHis and biotin supplementation on glucose, lipids and transaminases levels, as well as protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB).\\n\\nMETHODS: A total of 56 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 groups of 7 animals each and treated as follows: Control, CrHis, Biotin, CrHis+Biotin, Exercise, CrHis+Exercise, Biotin+Exercise, and CrHis+Biotin+Exercise. The doses of CrHis and biotin were 400\\xa0μg/kg and 6\\xa0mg/kg of diet, respectively. The training program consisted of running at 30\\xa0m/min for 30\\xa0min/day at 0% grade level, 5\\xa0days per week, once a day for 6\\xa0weeks.

Dietary CrHis and biotin supplementation exhibited a significant (p\\xa0<\\u20090.001) decrease in glucose (effect size\\u2009=\\u2009large; ƞ2\\u2009=\\xa00.773) and TG (effect size\\u2009=\\u2009large; ƞ2\\u2009=\\u20090.802) levels, and increase in HDL cholesterol compared with the exercise group. No significant change in AST and ALT (effect size\\u2009=\\u2009none) levels was recorded in all groups (p\\xa0>\\u20090.05).

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Asia; however, the molecular mechanism in its tumorigenesis remains unclear. Abnormal expression of claudins (CLDNs), a family of tight junction (TJ) proteins, plays an important role in the metastatic phenotype of epithelial-derived tumors by affecting tight junction structure, function and related cellular signaling pathways. In a previous study, we used a tissue chip assay to identify CLDN17 as an upregulated gene in HCC. Here we aimed to use molecular biology technology to explore the effect of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HCC and the underlying molecular mechanism, with the objective of identifying a new target for HCC treatment and the control of HCC metastasis.\\n\\nMETHOD: The expression levels of CLDN17 in HCC tissues and histologically non-neoplastic hepatic tissues were explored by immunohistochemistry. Stable transfection of the hepatocyte line HL7702 with CLDN17 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HL7702 cells in vitro was assessed by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, a Transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Western blotting was utilized to detect the activation state of Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) / signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) pathway. A Tyk2 RNA interference (RNAi) was utilized to determine the impact of the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway on the malignant phenotype of hepatocytes.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this work, our research group first found that CLDN17 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, we demonstrated that CLDN17 affected the Stat3 signaling pathway via Tyk2 and ultimately enhanced the migration ability of hepatocytes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, we confirmed that the upregulated expression of CLDN17 significantly enhances the migration ability of hepatocytes in vitro and we found that the activation of the Stat3 pathway by Tyk2 may an important mechanism by which CLDN17 promotes aggressiveness in hepatocytes.'\n",

In vitro transwell matrigel invasion assay and annexin V anoikis assay in HCC cells were conducted to investigate LMO3 related biological functions. In vivo intrahepatic and lung metastasis models were used to determine the role of LMO3 in HCC metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed to investigate the expression and mechanism of LMO3 in HCC.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that the expression of LMO3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, and it was closely related to clinicopathological findings and patient prognoses. Knockdown of LMO3 suppressed the invasion and anoikis inhibition of HCC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, the metastasis of SMMC-7721 cells was also suppressed by LMO3 knockdown in vivo. Furthermore, we found that LMO3 knockdown increased the phosphorylation of YAP and LATS1, and decrease Rho GTPases activities. LMO3 directly interacted with LATS1, and thus suppressed Hippo signaling. Recombinant LMO3 (rLMO3) protein administration decreased the phosphorylation of YAP and LATS1, and increased Rho GTPases activities. The inhibitors of the Hippo pathway abrogated rLMO3 protein-induced HCC cell invasion and anoikis inhibition.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LMO3 promotes HCC cell invasion and anoikis inhibition by interacting with LATS1 and suppressing Hippo signaling. LMO3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC in future.'\n",

High-content imaging analysis demonstrated that sulfone PSNPs were associated with the cells to a significantly higher extent than the other PSNPs. The apparent cellular adhesion and uptake of 200\\xa0nm PSNPs was not significantly increased compared to 50\\xa0nm PSNPs with the same surface charge and chemistry. Surface chemistry outweighs the impact of size on the observed PSNP cellular associations. Also transport of the sulfone PSNPs through the monolayer of cells was significantly higher than that of carboxyl PSNPs.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the composition of the protein corona and the PSNP surface chemistry influences cellular adhesion, uptake and monolayer transport, which might be predictive of the intestinal transport potency of NPs.'\n",

Repetitive injury and reprogramming of the lung epithelium are thought to be critical drivers of disease progression, contributing to fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and subsequently loss of lung architecture and function. To date, Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are the only approved drugs known to decelerate disease progression, however, if and how these drugs affect lung epithelial cell function, remains largely unexplored.\\n\\nMETHODS: We treated murine and human 3D ex vivo lung tissue cultures (3D-LTCs; generated from precision cut lung slices (PCLS)) as well as primary murine alveolar epithelial type II (pmATII) cells with Pirfenidone or Nintedanib. Murine 3D-LTCs or pmATII cells were derived from the bleomycin model of fibrosis. Early fibrotic changes were induced in human 3D-LTCs by a mixture of profibrotic factors. Epithelial and mesenchymal cell function was determined by qPCR, Western blotting, Immunofluorescent staining, and ELISA.\\n\\nRESULTS: Low μM concentrations of Nintedanib (1\\xa0μM) and mM concentrations of Pirfenidone (2.5\\xa0mM) reduced fibrotic gene expression including Collagen 1a1 and Fibronectin in murine and human 3D-LTCs as well as pmATII cells. Notably, Nintedanib stabilized expression of distal lung epithelial cell markers, especially Surfactant Protein C in pmATII cells as well as in murine and human 3D-LTCs.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone and Nintedanib exhibit distinct effects on murine and human epithelial cells, which might contribute to their anti-fibrotic action. Human 3D-LTCs represent a valuable tool to assess anti-fibrotic mechanisms of potential drugs for the treatment of IPF patients.'\n"

However, the need persists for fitting and refinement approaches that address those cases that require modeling assistance.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this paper, we describe algorithms to optimize the performance of such medium-resolution refinement methods. These algorithms aim to automatically optimize the parameters that define the density shape of the flexibly fitted model, as well as the time-dependent damper cutoff distance. Atomic distance constraints can be prescribed for cases where extra containment of parts of the structure is helpful, such as in regions where the density map is poorly defined. Also, we propose a simple stopping criterion that estimates the probable onset of overfitting during the simulation.\\n\\nRESULTS: The new set of algorithms produce more accurate fitting and refinement results, and yield a faster rate of convergence of the trajectory toward the fitted conformation.

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Spanins are phage lysis proteins required to disrupt the outer membrane. Phages employ either two-component spanins or unimolecular spanins in this final step of Gram-negative host lysis. Two-component spanins like Rz-Rz1 from phage lambda consist of an integral inner membrane protein: i-spanin, and an outer membrane lipoprotein: o-spanin, that form a complex spanning the periplasm. Two-component spanins exist in three different genetic architectures; embedded, overlapped and separated. In contrast, the unimolecular spanins, like gp11 from phage T1, have an N-terminal lipoylation signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane domain to account for the topology requirements. Our proposed model for spanin function, for both spanin types, follows a common theme of the outer membrane getting fused with the inner membrane, effecting the release of progeny virions.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here we present a SpaninDataBase which consists of 528 two-component spanins and 58 unimolecular spanins identified in this analysis. Primary analysis revealed significant differences in the secondary structure predictions for the periplasmic domains of the two-component and unimolecular spanin types, as well as within the three different genetic architectures of the two-component spanins. Using a threshold of 40% sequence identity over 40% sequence length, we were able to group the spanins into 143 i-spanin, 125 o-spanin and 13 u-spanin families. More than 40% of these families from each type were singletons, underlining the extreme diversity of this class of lysis proteins. Multiple sequence alignments of periplasmic domains demonstrated conserved secondary structure patterns and domain organization within family members. Furthermore, analysis of families with members from different architecture allowed us to interpret the evolutionary dynamics of spanin gene arrangement. Also, the potential universal role of intermolecular disulfide bonds in two-component spanin function was substantiated through bioinformatic and genetic approaches. Additionally, a novel lipobox motif, AWAC, was identified and experimentally verified.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings from this bioinformatic approach gave us instructive insights into spanin function, evolution, domain organization and provide a platform for future spanin annotation, as well as biochemical and genetic experiments. They also establish that spanins, like viral membrane fusion proteins, adopt different strategies to achieve fusion of the inner and outer membranes.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Iron deficiency is routinely treated with oral or systemic iron supplements, which are highly reactive and could induce oxidative stress via augmenting the activity of proinflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). To investigate the extent to which MPO is involved in iron-induced toxicity, acute (24 h) iron toxicity was induced by intraperitoneal administration of FeSO (25 mg/kg body weight) to MPO-deficient (MpoKO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Acute iron toxicity was also assessed in WT mice pretreated with an MPO inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide. Systemic iron administration up-regulated circulating MPO and neutrophil elastase and elevated systemic inflammatory and organ damage markers in WT mice. However, genetic deletion of MPO or its inhibition significantly reduced iron-induced organ damage and systemic inflammatory responses. In contrast to the acute model, 8 weeks of 2% carbonyl iron diet feeding to WT mice did not change the levels of circulating MPO and neutrophil elastase but promoted their accumulation in the liver. Even though both MpoKO and WT mice displayed similar levels of diet-induced hyperferremia, MpoKO mice showed significantly reduced inflammatory response and oxidative stress than the WT mice. In addition, WT bone-marrow-derived neutrophils (BMDN) generated more reactive oxygen species than MPO-deficient BMDN upon iron stimulation. Altogether, genetic deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of MPO substantially attenuated acute and chronic iron-induced toxicity. Our results suggest that targeting MPO during iron supplementation is a promising approach to reduce iron-induced toxicity/side effects in vulnerable population.'\n",

Compared with controls, LA treatment decreased blood pressure and showed the following in MRA: (1) increased lumen and external diameter, (2) decreased wall:lumen ratio and wall thickness, (3) decreased stiffness and (4) less collagen deposition. LA treatment reduced the contractile response to phenylephrine, although there were no changes observed in MRA in regard to the acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside responses. Incubation with L-NAME left-shifted the reactivity to phenylephrine only in the MRA treated group, suggesting that LA treatment can improve NO bioavailability. This result was accompanied by an increase \"in situ\" NO production. Incubation with tiron decreased vascular reactivity to phenylephrine in MRA in LA rats, which was accompanied by decreased superoxide anion production. Moreover, incubation with indomethacin (non-selective COX inhibitor, 10 μM), NS 398 (COX-2 specific inhibitor, 1 μM), furegrelate (TXA synthase inhibitor, 1 μM), SQ 29.548 (TP receptor antagonist, 1 μM) and SC 19220 (EP1 receptor antagonist, 10 μM) reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in MRA in the treated group. These results were accompanied by a reduction in COX-2 protein expression. In conclusion, these findings show that LA treatment decreases blood pressure. In addition, the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and structural changes in this hypertension model may be responsible for the reduction in blood pressure.'\n"

We evaluated impact of nanoparticulate (AlO-NPs) and ionic (Al) forms of aluminium on early seedling growth of Vigna radiata. While Al inhibited growth of seedlings, AlO-NPs did not affect it negatively. Unlike enhancement in proline, malondialdehyde and HO levels in roots and shoots induced by Al, these stress markers remained unaltered by AlO-NPs. No signs of membrane damage were recorded in roots of seedlings raised in presence of AlO-NPs; this was witnessed from insignificant electrolyte leakage and Evans blue uptake. Activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismustase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase in root and shoot were enhanced by Al. However, they were unaffected by AlO-NPs. Al enhanced levels of non-protein thiols, phenolics and ascorbate, with no alterations induced by AlO-NPs. These findings revealed that, AlO-NPs did not induce oxidative stress in seedlings. Seedlings raised in Al showed higher uptake of Al than those grown in AlO-NPs; Al content was higher in roots. Al was not detected in shoots of seedlings grown in AlO-NPs. Lower translocation of Al in seedlings raised in AlO-NPs was due to adsorption/restriction of AlO-NPs on root surface. Al caused ruptures on root epidermis of seedlings and inhibited root-hair formation, whereas no structural damage was caused by AlO-NPs. Our findings revealed that while ionic Al is highly toxic, nanoparticulate form of Al is non-toxic to growth of V. radiata.'\n",

Its extensive use in consumer products leads to a wide human exposure at high levels. Although the adverse effects of BPF on animal health are of increasing public concern, its risks on systematic glucose metabolism and blood glucose concentrations still remain largely unknown. Using zebrafish larvae as the model animal, we investigated the disturbance of BPF exposure on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish larvae at 96\\u202fh post fertilization were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100\\u202fμg/L of BPF for 48\\u202fh. Compared with the control group, glucose levels of larvae increased significantly in the 10 and 100\\u202fμg/L exposure groups, which are associated with enhancement of gluconeogenesis and suppression of glycolysis induced by high doses of BPF. Additionally, both mRNA expressions and protein levels of insulin increased significantly in the 10 and 100\\u202fμg/L exposure groups, while transcription levels of genes encoding insulin receptor substrates decreased significantly in these groups, indicating a possibly decreased insulin sensitivity due to impairment of insulin signaling transduction downstream of insulin receptor. Further, compared with BPF alone, co-exposure of larvae to BPF and rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, significantly attenuates increases in both glucose levels and mRNA expressions of a key gluconeogenesis enzyme. Our data therefore indicate impairing insulin signaling transduction may be the main mechanism through which BPF disrupts glucose metabolism and induces hyperglycemia. Results of the present study inform the health risk assessment of BPF and also suggest the use of zebrafish larvae in large-scale screening of chemicals with possible glucose metabolism disturbing effect.'\n",

The targeted inhibition of these features may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for IBD. Polydatin is an effective natural antioxidant that possesses strong antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties.

Mice were also treated with the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway inhibitor cyclopamine to estimate the efficacy of polydatin and Shh inhibitors on colitis. The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histology, levels of oxidative and apoptotic mediators and levels of Shh pathway components were evaluated.\\n\\nRESULTS: The polydatin treatment significantly attenuated the DAI, colon shortening and histological damage. In addition, polydatin administration effectively decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Polydatin also inhibited apoptosis in mice with colitis by downregulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, polydatin modulated Shh signaling pathway activation. After polydatin treatment, the main components of the Shh pathway, including Shh, Patched (Ptc), Smoothened (Smo), and glioblastoma-1 (Gli1), were upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Blockade of the Shh pathway using cyclopamine abolished the effects of polydatin on mice with colitis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Based on these observations, polydatin may suppress experimental colitis at least partially by regulating the Shh signaling pathway.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) was achieved in submerged biofilm membrane bioreactor (SBF-MBR) treating low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio wastewater. A novel bio-carrier coupling of sponge and biodegradable poly(butanediol succinate) (PBS) was applied as external carbon source and biofilm carrier. Result represented that NH-N and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were high of 99.1% and 94.3% in the SBF-MBR. Protein (PN) contents from SND-biofilm were reduced by 10.5% and 44.3% in TB-EPS and LB-EPS, while polysaccharides (PS) were reduced by 45.8% and 34.8%, respectively. 3D-EEM spectra indicated that protein-like, humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances were the main components in EPS and their peak intensities were reduced. Additionally, membrane fouling of SBF-MBR was improved after the achievement of biofilm. Microbial community analysis showed that Simplicispira, Thauera, Desulfovibrio, Dechlorobacter and Acinetobacter were dominant genus, which indicated co-existence of nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers in the SBF-MBR.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND/AIM: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncovirus that is commonly associated with the development of lymphomas and epithelial carcinomas. In the era of immunotherapy, histological evaluation of EBV-related cancers is currently a multi-sample, multi-technique process requiring separate time-consuming detection of EBV-encoded small RNAs by in situ hybridisation (ISH), and parallel labelling of sections for cancer-associated protein markers.\\n\\nMETHODS: Using EBV-associated tumours as proof-of-concept for feasibility, here we developed an approach that allows simultaneous detection of EBV RNAs and multiple protein markers such as PD-L1, EBV-LMP, CD8, CD4, CD20, CD30 and CD15on a single tissue section based on our recently reported automated staining protocol.\\n\\nRESULTS: We successfully combined multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to detect 3 abovementioned protein markers involved in cancer, with ISH, and applied the protocol to f tissue samples from patients diagnosed with EBV-associated pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC), gastric carcinoma and Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Empowered by the Vectra 3 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, we demonstrate the utility and potential of this integrated approach to concurrently detect and quantitate viral RNA and protein biomarkers of immune and tumour cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study represents an important step forward in the research and diagnosis of EBV-associated cancers, and could be readily modified to include other proteins and RNA markers to apply to other malignancies. More importantly, the novel automated ISH-mIF protocol that we detailly described here could also be readily reproduced by most of the diagnostic and research lab to future projects that aim to look at both RNA and protein markers.\"\n"

      "Abstract :'Anodic electroactive biofilms (EABs) need to overcome low current densities for applications such as microbial fuel cells or biosensors. EABs can store charge in self-produced redox proteins when temporarily left in open circuit, and discharge them once the electrode is appropriately repolarized, thus behaving as pseudocapacitors. Here we investigated the effect of such periodic polarization on the intrinsic nature of the EABs during their entire growth (i.e. starting from inoculation and for 10 days) on glassy carbon electrodes. An optimal periodic polarization (half-period of 10\\u202fs) greatly increased the maximum steady-state current density delivered by the Geobacter-dominated EABs (up to 1.10\\u202f±\\u202f0.02\\u202fmA\\u202fcm, n\\u202f=\\u202f3 electrodes) when compared to continuously polarized EABs (0.41\\u202f±\\u202f0.04\\u202fmA\\u202fcm); and increased the amount of electric charges produced per hour by 69\\u202f±\\u202f17% even taking into account the half-periods of open circuit. This enhancement was highly correlated with a substantial increase in charge carriers concentration (10.6\\u202f±\\u202f0.5\\u202fmM vs. 2.9\\u202f±\\u202f0.6\\u202fmM), allowing higher charge storage capacity and higher electron mobility across the EABs. Our results suggest that appropriate periodic polarizations may upregulate the expression of heme-containing redox proteins associated with the matrix, such as c-type cytochromes. The EABs grown under periodic polarization presented mushroom-like structures on their top layers, while EABs grown under continuous polarization were flat.'\n",

Testing of these analytes is routinely done by GC-MS but seldom account for interference from isomers or compounds with similar ion transitions. We developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method that accurately measures 3-HGA in urine and plasma specimens, while utilizing similar reagents and instrumentation used for the routine performance of amino acid and acylcarnitine analysis in determining the diagnosis of several metabolic disorders.\\n\\nMETHOD: Plasma and urine samples were added aliquots of the deuterated 3-HGA internal standard and acetonitrile. The protein-free supernatant was brought to dryness, and the residue derivatized using 3\\u202fM HCL in 1-butanol with heating. The dried derivative was then reconstituted in 50% methanol-water solution and aliquot transferred to an HPLC vial for analysis by LC-MS/MS. Separation was performed using a C8 HPLC column under flow gradient conditions of 0.2% formic acid in water and methanol, respectively. Ionization was by ESI and detection of selected precursor-product ion transitions by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode.\\n\\nRESULTS: The butyl-ester derivative of 3-HGA eluted at 7.82\\u202fmin while 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HGA) eluted at 8.21\\u202fmin. This was equivalent to a separation factor of 1.05 and a resolution of 1.03, respectively. The 3-HGA calibration curve was linear over the range 6.20-319\\u202fng\\u202fmL (r\\u202f=\\u202f0.9996), and the reportable range determined by the linearity was found to be 1.54-384\\u202fng\\u202fmL. The calculated limits of detection and quantitation were 0.348 and 1.56\\u202fng\\u202fmL, respectively. Intra- and Inter-assay %CVs for quality control plasma and urine samples ranged from 2 to 18%, with recoveries of 66-115%. The method correlated to the gold standard GC-MS method for both serum (r\\u202f≥\\u202f0.996) and urine analysis (r\\u202f≥\\u202f0.949).

Over the past decade, its treatment was revolutionized by the development and introduction into clinical practice of the direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents targeting the non-structural viral proteins NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B. However, the current treatment options still have important limitations, thus, the development of new classes of DAAs acting on different viral targets and having better pharmacological profile is highly desirable. The hepatitis C virus p7 viroporin is a relatively small hydrophobic oligomeric viral ion channel that plays a critical role during virus assembly and maturation, making it an attractive and validated target for the development of the cage compound-based inhibitors. Using the homology modeling, molecular dynamics, and molecular docking techniques, we have built a representative set of models of the hepatitis C virus p7 ion channels (Gt1a, Gt1b, Gt1b_L20F, Gt2a, and Gt2b), analyzed the inhibitor binding sites, and identified a number of potential broad-spectrum inhibitor structures targeting them. For one promising compound, the binding to these targets was additionally confirmed and the binding modes and probable mechanisms of action were clarified by the molecular dynamics simulations. A number of compounds were synthesized, and the tests of their antiviral activity (using the BVDV model) and cytotoxicity demonstrate their potential therapeutic usefulness and encourage further more detailed studies. The proposed approach is also suitable for the design of broad-spectrum ligands interacting with other multiple labile targets including various viroporins.'\n"

Comparison to Cisplatin show that Zeise's salt is more reactive towards nucleophilic sites in proteins. Our data indicate that the ethylene ligand remains on the platinum when coordinated to a nitrogen donor in the biomolecule and therefore offers a linkage for the introduction of further functionality. When attached to sulfur donors in the biomolecule, platinum(II) provides a site for the formation of crosslinks and loops in the biomolecules by losing all four of its initial ligands.\"\n",

We evaluated the effects of exposure to different doses of PM on the behavioral development of offspring via a PM exposure model established by intratracheal instillation, explored its mechanism and the protective effects of quercetin and VC intervention, and focused on the protein expression of CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. Specifically, Exposure to PM during gestation and lactation period caused maternal oxidative stress. Maternal exposure to PM changed postnatal open-field behaviors in both gender, impaired spatial learning and memory in the female offspring, increased the level of IL-1β, IL-6, down-regulated p-CREB/CREB, BDNF, TrkB, p-CaMKII/CaMKII, p-CaMKIV/CaMKIV, up-regulated p-Akt/Akt and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in the offspring. In addition, maternal supplementation with quercetin ameliorate the maternal oxidative stress, improved progeny inflammatory response, regulated BDNF, TrkB, p-Akt/Akt, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in female offspring, regulated TrkB, p-CREB/CREB and p-Akt/Akt in male offspring. Maternal supplementation with VC increased the levels of CAT in maternal mice, up-regulated BDNF in female offspring, regulated p-CREB/CREB and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in male offspring.

In current experiment, we explore the relationship between Chinese traditional medicine (Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction) and gastric cancer in the PLGC rat animal models and epithelial-mesenchymal transitioned GES-1 cells which were induced useing 1- Methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). PLGC rat model showed significant deterioration in the gastric mucosa with terrible growth rate in body weight and more atypical hyperplasia in gastric mucosa. MC cells, MNNG induced GES-1 cells which epithelial- mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-related proteins have a great change compare with normal GES-1 cells. The cells had characteristics of malignant cells including proliferation, invasion and metastasis ability. Our research founds that Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could inhibit cell proliferation and increased apoptosis by increase the level of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and caspase-3 and decreased the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, block the cells in G0/G1 phase simultaneously. Furthermore, Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could inhibit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF-kB) activity and inhibit its transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. However, when we incubated with NF-κB activator PMA, the effect of Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction was reversed. These results suggested that Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could be used as a method for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions, and possibly provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer and gastric precancerous lesions.'\n",

To date, there is little information on GPR30 and its expression in postmenopausal type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the heart. The current study hypothesized that GPR30 mediated cardioprotective effects of E2 in ovariectomized diabetic rats. Female ovariectomized diabetic rats were divided in nine groups: Control, Vehicle, Diabetes, Proestrous, Non-proestrous, E, E2+Vehicle, E2+G15, and G1. G15 is a GPR30 antagonist, while G1 is an agonist of GPR30. T2D was induced by high fat diet and streptozotocin. E2, G1 and G15 were administrated for four weeks after establishment of T2D. Results showed that mean arterial pressure, fasting blood glucose and HOMA-IR in diabetic and vehicle groups were alleviated by E2 and G1, while salutary effects of E2 were inhibited by G15. Furthermore, E2 and G1 improved cardiac weight, atherogenic and cardiovascular risk indices; meanwhile G15 exacerbated cardiac weight and atherogenic indices. Also, diabetes increased cardiac levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 and E2 only decreased interleukin 6. Significant decrement in the level of interleukin 10, and GPR30 protein were observed in diabetic group, whereas E2 and G1 increased the cardiac levels of interleukin 10, and GPR30 protein.

In the current study, we investigated the neuro-protective effects of aloperine against cytotoxicity in mouse Neuro2a (N2a) cells transfected with Swedish amyloid precursor protein (Swe-APP) mutant and presenilin 1 exon 9 deletion mutant (N2a/Swe.D9). We found that aloperine ameliorated oxidative stress patterns in N2a/Swe.D9 cells by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, aloperine treatment led to elevated generation of ATP and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in N2a/Swe.D9 cells. Importantly, we found that aloperine treatment reduced the vulnerability of N2a/Swe.D9 cells to HO. Aloperine also inhibited apoptosis of N2a/Swe.D9 cells via a mitochondria-dependent pathway.

However, the biological role of FABP7 in CC is still poorly understood. The current study aimed to investigate the role of FABP7 in CC and illuminate the potential molecular mechanisms. In this present study, we found that FABP7 was highly expressed in CC tissues and cell lines, suggesting the possible involvement of FABP7 in CC tumorigenesis. Moreover, functional investigations showed that FABP7-overexpression promoted CC cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle progression and inhibited cell apoptosis; on the contrary, FABP7 knockdown produced an inhibitory effects on CC cell proliferation and survival. Notably, FABP7 knockdown inhibited colon tumor growth in vivo. In addition, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that FABP7 exerted its promoting effects on CC cell proliferation and survival through activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that FABP7 may be used as a novel diagnostic bio-marker and a potential therapeutic target for CC.'\n",

In addition, nomograms were established in the basis of all significant factors, predicting the DFS and OS.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The presenting study indicated that preoperative D-dimer level was effective prognostic factors with a discriminatory ability for DFS and OS, superior to other indicators. Meanwhile, CAR was favorable prognostic factor for OS. Nomograms based on DFS and OS can be recommended as practical models to evaluate prognosis for patient with spinal ESFTs.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Fifteen million babies are born preterm every year and a significant number suffer from permanent neurological injuries linked to white matter injury (WMI). A chief cause of preterm birth itself and predictor of the severity of WMI is exposure to maternal-fetal infection-inflammation such as chorioamnionitis. There are no neurotherapeutics for this WMI. To affect this healthcare need, the repurposing of drugs with efficacy in other white matter injury models is an attractive strategy. As such, we tested the efficacy of GSK247246, an H3R antagonist/inverse agonist, in a model of inflammation-mediated WMI of the preterm born infant recapitulating the main clinical hallmarks of human brain injury, which are oligodendrocyte maturation arrest, microglial reactivity, and hypomyelination. WMI is induced by mimicking the effects of maternal-fetal infection-inflammation and setting up neuroinflammation. We induce this process at the time in the mouse when brain development is equivalent to the human third trimester; postnatal day (P)1 through to P5 with i.p. interleukin-1β (IL-1β) injections. We initiated GSK247246 treatment (i.p at 7\\u202fmg/kg or 20\\u202fmg/kg) after neuroinflammation was well established (on P6) and it was administered twice daily through to P10. Outcomes were assessed at P10 and P30 with gene and protein analysis. A low dose of GSK247246 (7\\u202fmg/kg) lead to a recovery in protein expression of markers of myelin (density of Myelin Basic Protein, MBP & Proteolipid Proteins, PLP) and a reduction in macro- and microgliosis (density of ionising adaptor protein, IBA1 & glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP). Our results confirm the neurotherapeutic efficacy of targeting the H3R for WMI seen in a cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis and a recently reported clinical trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Further work is needed to develop a slow release strategy for this agent and test its efficacy in large animal models of preterm infant WMI.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Because of essentiality and toxicity of iron in our body, iron metabolism is tightly regulated in cells. In mammalian cells, iron regulatory protein 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are the central regulators of cellular iron metabolism. IRPs regulate iron metabolism by interacting with the RNA stem-loop structures, iron-responsive elements (IREs), found on the transcripts encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism only in iron depleted condition. It is also well-known that the ubiquitin system plays central roles in cellular iron regulation because both IRPs having the IRE binding activity are recognized and ubiquitinated by the SCF ubiquitin ligase in condition of iron-replete. FBXL5, which is a substrate recognition subunit of SCF, senses iron availability via its hemerythrin-like domain. In this small article, current understanding of the roles of SCF-mediated degradation of IRPs played in cellular iron metabolism is discussed.'\n",

Visual problems in PD patients are common, although retinal pathology associated with PD is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate retinal pathology in a transgenic mouse model (TgM83) expressing the human A53T α-synuclein mutation and assess the effect of α-synuclein \"seeding\" on the development of retinal pathology. Two-month-old TgM83 mice were intracerebrally inoculated with brain homogenate from old (12-18\\u202fmonths) TgM83 mice. Retinas were then analyzed at 5\\u202fmonths of age. We analyzed retinas from 5-month-old and 8-month-old uninoculated healthy TgM83 mice, and old (12-18\\u202fmonths) mice that were euthanized following the development of clinical signs. Retinas of B6C3H mice (genetic background of the TgM83 mouse) served as control. We used immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to detect accumulation of α-synuclein, pTau, inflammation, changes in macroautophagy, and cell death. Raman spectroscopy was used to test the potential to differentiate between retinal tissues of healthy mice and diseased mice. This work demonstrates retinal changes associated with the A53T mutation. Retinas of non-inoculated TgM83 mice had accumulation of α-synuclein, \"pre-tangle\" tau, activation of retinal glial cells, and photoreceptor cell loss by 8\\u202fmonths of age. The development of these changes is accelerated by inoculation with brain homogenate from clinically ill TgM83 mice. Compared to non-inoculated 5-month-old TgM83 mice, retinas of inoculated 5-month-old mice had increased accumulation of α-synuclein (pSer129) and pTau proteins, upregulated microglial activation, and dysregulated macroautophagy. Raman spectroscopic analysis was able to discriminate between healthy and diseased mice. This study describes retinal pathology resulting from the A53T mutation. We show that seeding with brain homogenates from old TgM83 mice accelerates retinal pathology. We demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used to accurately identify a diseased retina based on its biochemical profile, and that α-synuclein accumulation may contribute to accumulation of pTau proteins, neuroinflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and photoreceptor cell death. Our work provides insight into retinal changes associated with Parkinson\\'s disease, and may contribute to a better understanding of visual symptoms experienced by patients.'\n",

      "Abstract :'To demonstrate the usefulness of complementary next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) counting, we analyzed 196 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), and large-cell carcinoma (LCC) were used to prepare tissue microarrays and were examined by protein H-score IHC image analysis and NGS for oncogenes and proto-oncogenes and genes of tumor suppressors, immune checkpoints, epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). In patients with brain metastases, primary tumors expressed lower PIK3CA protein levels. Overexpression of TP53 and a higher PD-L1 protein H-score were detected in patients that underwent surgical treatment followed by chemotherapy as compared to those that underwent only surgical treatment The absence of brain metastases was associated with wild-type sequences of genes EGFR, CD267, CTLA-4, and ZEB1. The combination of protein overexpression according to IHC and mutation according to NGS was rare (i.e., represented by a very low percentage of concordant cases), except for TP53 and VEGF. Our data suggest that protein levels detected by IHC may be a useful complementary tool when mutations are not detected by NGS and also support the idea to expand this approach beyond ADC to include SqCC and even LCC, particularly for patients with unusual clinical characteristics. Conversely, well-pronounced immunogenotypic features appeared to predict the clinical outcome after univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with a solid ADC subtype and mutated genes EGFR, CTLA4, PDCD1LG2, or ZEB1 complemented with PD-L1 or TP53 protein lower expression that only underwent surgical treatment, who develop brain metastases, may have the worst prognosis.'\n"

The objective of our research is to explore the prognostic significance of ADAMTS-2 in gastric carcinoma. A total of 655 samples with full clinicopathological data were investigated in this study. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry (TMA-IHC) analysis was used to analyze the relationship between clinicopathological characteristics and ADAMTS-2 expression. Oncomine and Kaplan-Meier plotters were performed for the relationship analysis between prognosis and ADAMTS-2 expression in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Compared with that of normal tissues, the ADAMTS-2 protein expression was remarkably higher in gastric cancer cells and fibroblast cells. The results of univariate analysis indicated that the expression of ADAMTS-2 in tumor cells and fibroblast cells, Laurén classification, TNM grade, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in gastric cancer were all correlated with the overall survival. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that the high expression of ADAMTS-2 in gastric cancer cells and fibroblast cells both were independent prognostic factors. Therefore, ADAMTS-2 may be a potential biomarker for assessing the prognosis of gastric carcinoma.'\n",

With lack of investigations for molecular pathogenesis underlying that develop BC, the therapeutic efficacy of several therapeutic approaches existing is still unsatisfactory. Here, our study aimed to explore the potentially biological function of MAN1B1 on BC. In this study, MAN1B1 expression level in BC tissues and normal tissues was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and correlation between its expression and prognosis was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Knockout of MAN1B1 was performed using silencing RNA and the efficacy of MAN1B1 knockout was identified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The BC cells proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and then the cells apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry following MAN1B1 knocked down by small interfering RNA. Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was evaluated by detecting related markers, namely AKT, p-AKT, 4E-BP-1 and Bax using western blot assay. As a result, the MAN1B1 expression was higher in BC tissues than those in normal tissues, besides, its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, MAN1B1 reduction by silencing RNA approach resulted in BC cells proliferation suppression and BC cells apoptosis promotion. Finally, AKT signaling activity was inhibited by MAN1B1 silencing. Taken together, these results unraveled that MAN1B1 may act on an oncogenic action in BC, which improved the likelihood of MAN1B1 taking on a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for treating BC.'\n",

The present study aims to evaluate the association of VDBP genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to and chronicity of HCV infection in a high-risk Chinese population. Seven genetic variants in the VDBP gene were genotyped in a case-control study of 886 patients with HCV persistent infection, 539 subjects with spontaneous clearance, and 1081 uninfected controls. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of these variants on HCV infection outcomes. The results showed that two variants rs7041-G and rs3733359-T alleles were significantly associated with increased susceptibility of HCV infection, and the combined effect of the two unfavorable alleles was related to an elevated risk of HCV infection in a locus-dosage manner (P\\u202f=\\u202f8.16\\u202f×\\u202f10). Interaction analysis manifested that rs7041-GT/GG and rs3733359-CT/TT jointly increased risk of HCV infection. Moreover, haplotype analysis suggested that compared with the most frequent TC haplotype, the haplotype carrying GT indicated a risk effect of HCV infection [odds ratio (OR)\\u202f=\\u202f1.464]. However, no significant associations were observed for the other five variants. These findings implied that VDBP rs7041-G and rs3733359-T variants may contribute to increased susceptibility to HCV infection in a high-risk Chinese population.'\n",

Conventional treatment options have limited efficacy because most cases are in the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The present study evaluates the anti-cancer activity of 1,2-diazole (pyrazole), a natural compound from mangrove plant Rhizophora apiculata (R.apiculata) on A549 lung carcinoma cells. In the present study the anti-cancer mechanism of pyrazole, was examined by the expression level of proteins Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) which are commonly associated with the cell signaling pathways that control cell survival and apoptosis, that could facilitate to develop a novel target and effective treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Pyrazole significantly induced cell cycle arrest and initiated apoptosis through inhibition of downstream components of EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway. Pyrazole disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and modulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 which could probably lead to caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, Pyrazole suppresses the expression of CDK-2 resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and in the G1-S phase transition. Taken together, the current study provides new insight in to the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-cancer activity of pyrazole in NSCLC, A549 cells. The study opens an avenue for development of a natural compound as a potential therapeutic agent which could target cell signaling pathways to combat human NSCLC.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The human soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (hsEH) is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective signalling mediators known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs' conversion into the corresponding diols by hsEH generates non-bioactive molecules, thereby the enzyme inhibition would be expected to enhance the EETs bioavailability, and their beneficial properties. Numerous inhibitors have been developed to target the enzyme, some of which are showing promising antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. Thus far, the preparation of the recombinant enzyme for enzymatic and structural in vitro studies has been performed mainly using a baculovirus expression system. More recently, it was reported that the enzyme could be exogenously expressed and isolated from E. coli, although limited amounts of active protein were obtained. We herein describe two novel methods to yield pure recombinant enzyme. The first describes the expression and purification of the full-length enzyme from eukaryotic cells HEK293-F, whilst the second concerns the C-terminal domain of hsEH obtained from the cost-effective and rapid E. coli prokaryotic system. The two methods successfully generated satisfactory amounts of functional enzyme, with virtually identical enzymatic activity. Overall, the protocols described in this paper can be employed for the recombinant expression and purification of active hsEH, to be used in future biomedical investigations and for high-throughput screening of inhibitors for potential use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Macrophages represent key inflammatory cellular effectors of the innate immune response. Despite being widely acknowledged as professional phagocytes, the functional roles played by these cells have been progressively widened over the years to encompass regulation of the adaptive immune system, stimulation or suppression of cancer cell growth and tissue remodeling. These diverse functional features have led to the concept of \"macrophage plasticity\", i.e. the ability of these cells to express a wide range of phenotypes endowed with different functional roles. Several activation programs have been described for mammalian macrophages, based mainly on their differential transcriptional profiles. Based on established in vitro experimental conditions, many researchers currently refer to the M1 (or M1-like) and M2 (or M2-like) terms to describe the two extremes of a rather broad spectrum of polarization states that macrophages can experience in vivo. In light of the widely recognized opposite roles of M1-like and M2-like macrophages on cancer growth, and our largely incomplete knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the M1-like versus M2-like balance within a tumor mass, we report here results from in vitro assays pointing at the human RNASET2 gene as a potential regulator of the balance between M1-like/M2-like macrophage polarization. Not only do our results confirm previous in vivo data, thus further supporting a role for this pleiotropic protein in the innate immune system, but they also define RNASET2 as a new molecular target with potential applications for in vivo reprogramming of macrophage polarization, an increasingly appraised anticancer strategy.'\n"

Subsequently, GNB5, CDC42, SPTAN1, GNG2, GNAZ, PRKACB, SST, CD44, FGF2, PHLPP1, APP, and FYN were identified as the candidate hub genes by using topological parameters. Later, Fpclass a PPI tool identified WASP gene, a co-expression interacting partner with highest network topology. Moreover, an enhanced enrichment pathway namely Opioid signaling was obtained using ClueGo, depicting the roles of the hub genes in signaling and neuronal mechanisms. The transcriptional regulatory factors and the common miRNA connected to them were identified by using MatInspector and miRTarbase. Later, a regulatory network constructed showed that PLAG, T2FB, CREB, NEUR, and GATA were the most commonly connected transcriptional factors and hsa-miR-122-5p was the most prominent miRNA. In a nutshell, these hub genes and the enriched pathway could help understand at a molecular level and eventually used as therapeutic targets for Down syndrome.\"\n",

LcrV mediates the delivery of Yop toxins into host cells and upregulates TLR2-dependent IL-10 production. Although LcrV can interact with the receptor-bound human interferon-γ (hIFN-γ), the significance of these interactions in plague pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we determined the parameters of specific interactions of LcrV and LcrV with primary human thymocytes and Jurkat T-leukemia cells in the presence of receptor-bound hIFN-γ. Although the C-terminal region of hIFN-γ contains a GRRA site needed for high-affinity binding of LcrV and LcrV, in the hIFN-γ homodimer, these GRRA target sites becomes accessible for targeting by LcrV or LcrV only after immobilization of the hIFN-γ homodimer on the hIFN-γ receptors of thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells. The interaction of LcrV or LcrV with receptor-bound hIFN-γ on the thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells caused apoptosis of both cell types, which can be completely blocked by the addition of monoclonal antibodies specific to the LEEL and DEEI sites of LcrV. The ability of LcrV to utilize hIFN-γ is insidious and may account in part for the severe symptoms of plague in humans.'\n",

Computation of the protein surface hydrophobicity (PSH) index using 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate indicated that considerable decrement in PSH value of the protein happened upon drug binding. The binding site of HCTZ in HSA was identified using warfarin and ibuprofen as site markers, a result confirmed by molecular docking study.

In this study, we focused on the enzymes responsible for the part of the ethanol production pathway from pyruvate to ethanol. In T. saccharolyticum, we replaced all of the genes encoding proteins in this pathway with their homologs from C. thermocellum and examined what combination of gene replacements restricted high ethanol titer. We found that a pathway consisting of Ct_nfnAB, Ct_fd, Ct_adhE and Ts_pforA was sufficient to support ethanol titer greater than 50g/L, however replacement of Ts_pforA by Ct_pfor1 dramatically decreased the maximum ethanol titer to 14g/L.

This organelle has its own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and genetic variants in this molecule can alter the normal energy metabolism in the brain, contributing to the development of a wide assortment of Neurological Disorders (ND), including neurodevelopmental syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. These ND are comprised by a heterogeneous group of syndromes and diseases that encompass different cognitive phenotypes and behavioral disorders, such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Huntington disease, Leigh Syndrome and bipolar disorder. In this work we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and describe the mitochondrial genetic variants associated with the occurrence of ND. Majority of genetic variants found in mtDNA were associated with Single Nucleotide Polimorphisms (SNPs), ~79%, with ~15% corresponding to deletions, ~3% to Copy Number Variations (CNVs), ~2% to insertions and another 1% included mtDNA replication problems and genetic rearrangements. We also found that most of the variants were associated with coding regions of mitochondrial proteins but were also found in regulatory transcripts (tRNA and rRNA) and in the D-Loop replication region of the mtDNA. After analysis of mtDNA deletions and CNV, none of them occur in the D-Loop region. This SLR shows that all transcribed mtDNA molecules have mutations correlated with ND. Finally, we describe that all mtDNA variants found were associated with deterioration of cognitive (dementia) and intellectual functions, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and personality and behavior problems.\"\n",

Both androgens affected steroidogenic gene expression, with most alterations occurring at the 24-hour time point. The gene with the highest fold-change, and shortest interval to expression alteration, was 3βhsd for both androgens. Potential differences between the two model androgens were observed in increased expression of cyp17a1 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βhsd), which were only altered after exposure to DHT and in expression levels of cytochrome P450 11A1 (cyp11a1), which was upregulated by MT but not altered by DHT. Results from this study show both androgens interact at the gonadal level of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and may possess some distinct gene expression impacts.

Focusing on expression of the surface marker CD36, the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was examined using various PPARγ agonists and antagonists. As the PPARγ ligand-binding domain contains multiple ligand-binding sites (LBS), agonist and antagonists targeting the different sites were used. DBP accelerated PMA-induced morphological changes and increased expression of CD36, although to a lesser degree than the PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). A proteomics screening revealed that DBP enhanced expression of PPARγ-regulated proteins. During combined exposures, DBP partly attenuated the effect of rosiglitazone, an agonist binding reversibly to PPARγ's canonical LBS. In contrast, DBP increased expression of CD36 in combination with 15d-PGJ2 which binds irreversibly to the canonical LBS. Thus, DBP appears to interact with both the canonical and alternative LBS. In line with this, the antagonist GW9662 binding to the canonical LBS, only partly reduced DBP effects on CD36, while the dual-site PPARγ antagonist SR16832 completely blocked the effects of DBP. Overall, the results show that DBP modifies PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells through interaction with PPARγ.\"\n",

Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained the RNA sequence of a third common bean endornavirus, which we named Phaseolus vulgaris endornavirus 3 (PvEV3). The complete sequence consisted of 15,205nt in length with a single open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein of 4932 aa, and untranslated regions of 344önt and 62önt at the 5' and 3' ends respectively. The polyprotein contained conserved protein domains including viral helicase 1, peptidase C97, glycosyltransferases of the GTB-type, and RdRp 2. The polyprotein shared 31% amino acid identity with the counterpart encoded by Hordeum vulgare endornavirus. A phylogenetic tree constructed with the RdRp sequences of PvEV3 and other endornaviruses placed PvEV3 in a clade with members of the genus Alphaendornavirus. PvEV3 was detected in cultivated and wild P. vulgaris genotypes as single and mixed infections with two other common bean endornaviruses. The natural occurrence of three distinct endornaviruses in a single plant species is unique and has not been reported in other plant-endornavirus systems.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The progression of hepatosteatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a critical step in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular cancer. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for this progression is essentially unknown. This study was designed to determine the role of miR-378 in regulating NASH progression.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used immunohistochemistry, luciferase assays and immunoblotting to study the role of miR-378 in modulating an inflammatory pathway. Wild-type mice kept on a high fat diet (HFD) were injected with miR-378 inhibitors or a mini-circle expression system containing miR-378 to study loss and gain-of functions of miR-378.\\n\\nRESULTS: MiR-378 expression is increased in livers of dietary obese mice and NASH patients. Further studies revealed that miR-378 directly targeted Prkag2 that encodes AMP-activated protein kinase γ 2 (AMPKγ2). AMPK signaling is a negative regulator of NFκB-TNFα inflammatory axis by increasing deacetylase activity of Sirtuin 1. By targeting Prkag2, miR-378 reduced Sirtuin1 activity and facilitated an inflammatory pathway involving NFκB-TNFα. In contrast, miR-378 knockdown using its inhibitor induced expression of Prkag2, increased Sirtuin1 activity and blocked NFκB-TNFα axis. Additional knockdown of increased Prkag2 offset the inhibitory effects of miR-378 inhibitor on the NFκB-TNFα axis, suggesting that AMPK signaling mediates the role of miR-378 in facilitating this inflammatory pathway. Liver-specific expression of miR-378 triggered the development of NASH and fibrosis by activating TNFα signaling. Ablation of TNFα in miR-378-treated mice impaired the ability of miR-378 to facilitate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that TNFα signaling is required for miR-378 to promote NASH.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: MiR-378 plays a key role in the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by facilitating NFκB-TNFα axis; and might act as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH. Lay summary The recent epidemic increase in obesity has been associated with a sharp rise in the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly described and effective therapeutic approaches against NAFLD are lacking. The results establish that miR-378 facilitates the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and suggest the therapeutic potential of microRNA-378 inhibitor for the treatment of NAFLD.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Microglia activation and neuroinflammation play important roles in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury (SBI). In this study, we attempted to investigate the potential effects of Andrographolide (Andro) on ICH-induced SBI and the possible mechanisms behind these effects. Andro treatment effectively reduced neuronal cell death and degeneration and alleviated neurobehavioral disorders and brain edema in vivo. In an in vitro study, microglia activation-induced neuronal cell death was ameliorated by Andro treatment. In addition, microglia activation and neuroinflammation were induced by ICH, exhibiting elevated cytokine levels, which could be reversed with Andro treatment. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly decreased after treatment with Andro, both in vivo and in vitro, due to the inhibition of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway activation. Meanwhile, Andro decreased the levels of IL-1β and LDH, as well as microglia pyroptosis induced by ICH by suppressing the assembly of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. In summary, this study reveals an anti-inflammatory effect of Andro and its potential mechanisms, and it shows that Andro is a potential candidate for improving ICH-induced SBI.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Ischemia and reperfusion remain inseparable elements of numerous medical procedures such as by-pass surgery, organ transplantation or other cardiology and intervention radiology. The contraction of the smooth muscle of the vessel is considered to be one of the basic components leading to impaired perfusion, an increase in the oxygen deficit of the endothelium of the vessel, and subsequently also to tissues vascularized by the vessel. Main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ischemia and reperfusion on vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated pharmacologically with mastoparan-7 (direct G-protein activator) in comparison to stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor agonist - phenylephrine, and direct calcium channel activator - Bay K8644.\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Experiments were performed on isolated and perfused tail artery of Wistar rats. Contraction force in our model was measured by increased level of perfusion pressure with a constant flow.\\n\\nRESULTS: Concentration-response curves obtained for phenylephrine, mastoparan-7 and Bay K8644 presented a sigmoidal relation. Ischemia induced hyporreactivity of vessels, whereas during reperfusion the significant time related hyperreactivity for phenylephrine and mastoparan-7 only but not for Bay K8644. These reactions were secondary to the modulation of calcium influx from intra- and extracellular calcium stores.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of our experiments suggest that mastoparan-7 significantly induces contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells not only for controls but in the presence of ischemia and reperfusion too. Potential therapeutic applications of the observed reactions are important. They may include regenerative processes within the nervous system, studies on the improvement of blood flow within the microcirculation, or antimicrobial activity. Modulation of the G protein-phospholipase C response may also be an interesting point of action of future drugs modifying the response to stimulation during ischemia in particular, such activities could take place during the transport of organs for transplantation.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Increased plasma triglyceride serves as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes circulating triglyceride, plays a crucial role in normal lipid metabolism and energy balance. Hypertriglyceridemia is possibly caused by gene mutations resulting in LPL dysfunction. There are many factors that both positively and negatively interact with LPL thereby impacting TG lipolysis. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), a newly identified factor, appears essential for transporting LPL to the luminal side of the blood vessel and offering a platform for TG hydrolysis. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that GPIHBP1 exerts distinct functions and plays diverse roles in human triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. In this review, we discuss the GPIHBP1 gene, protein, its expression and function and subsequently focus on its regulation and provide critical evidence supporting its role in TRL metabolism. Underlying mechanisms of action are highlighted, additional studies discussed and potential therapeutic targets reviewed.'\n",

Thus, host skin cells are permissive to ZIKV infection and are the first line of defense against the virus. Here, we examined the role and mechanisms of antiviral skin immunity against ZIKV infection. ZIKV infection (African lineage MR766) in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn), and HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in distinct expression changes in retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLR), such as RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Interestingly, inhibition of RIG-I using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in increased viral gene expression and reduced induction of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, ZIKV non-structural protein 1 directly interacted with RIG-I or MDA5 and downregulated RLR-mediated antiviral signaling pathways. Asian lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59) infection also showed a distinct pattern of antiviral immunity in human skin cells, compared to other ZIKV strains. Additionally, ZIKV infections in human neural progenitor cells induced the robust activation of RLR-mediated signaling, followed by highly enhanced ISG expression. Our findings provide important insights into ZIKV tropism and subsequent antiviral signaling pathways that regulate ZIKV replication in HDFs and HEKn cells.'\n",

Recent studies have established two Geminin family coiled-coil containing nuclear regulatory proteins, Gmnc and Multicilin (Mci), in the specification and differentiation of the MCCs. Both Gmnc and Mci are devoid of a DNA binding domain: they regulate transcription by associating with E2f family transcription factors, notably E2f4 and E2f5. Here, we have studied the relative contribution of these two E2f factors in MCC development using the zebrafish embryo, which differentiates MCCs within kidney tubules and the nose. We found that while E2f4 is fully dispensable, E2f5 is essential for MCCs to form in the kidney tubules. Moreover, using a variety of double mutant combinations we show that E2f5 has a more prominent role in MCC development in the zebrafish than E2f4. This contrasts with current evidence from the mouse, where E2f4 seems to be more important. Thus, distinct combinatorial activities of the E2f4 and E2f5 proteins regulate the specification and differentiation of MCCs in zebrafish and mice.'\n",

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue sections by polymer detection technique.\\n\\nRESULTS: Nine tumours occurred in 7 males and 2 females, with age ranging from 36 to 72 years (average=58.7), in the sacrum (7) and spine (2). On FNAC, 5 cases were either diagnosed or diagnosed with a 'suggestion' of a chordoma; while three cases were diagnosed with chordoma, as a differential diagnosis. On review, smears were moderately cellular, comprising myxoid stroma (9/9), epithelioid cells (9/9), physaliphorous cells (8/9), including binucleation (7/9), prominent nucleolisation (2/9), pleomorphic cells (2/9) and intranuclear inclusions (3/9). Immunohistochemically, tumour cells expressed cytokeratin (4/4), pan cytokeratin (4/4), EMA (8/8), S100 protein (6/8) and brachyury (8/8). Five patients underwent surgical excision, including two underwent adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and four patients, who underwent RT. During follow-up (n=8), a single patient developed recurrence and another presented with metastatic lesions. Finally, 5 patients were alive-with-disease (7 to 53 months); a single patient was free-of-disease (4 months) and two patients died-of-disease, the latter cases displayed pleomorphic cells and intranuclear inclusions.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Chordomas can be primarily diagnosed by FNAC in a typical clinico-radiologic setting with combination of 'key' cytomorphologic features. Pleomorphic cells and intranuclear inclusions are associated with a relatively aggressive subtype. An exact diagnosis has treatment implications and requires confirmation by brachyury immunostaining.

      "Abstract :\"Cutaneous deposition of eosinophil degranulation proteins is a major feature of eosinophil rich cutaneous diseases including bullous pemphigoid (BP). We sought to better understand the effect of two of these proteins -eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN), on human keratinocytes using the Het-1A cell line. To evaluate expression of key cytokines and chemokines observed in BP as well as metal metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), we performed qPCR and in-cell Western assays on cells treated with either ECP or EDN. We further evaluated the effect of ECP and EDN on keratinocyte survival, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. Lastly, we assessed ECP and EDN's ability to induce keratinocyte detachment from provisional matrix. Treatment of keratinocytes with ECP and EDN resulted in significant increases in IL-5, eotaxin-1 and CCL5 (RANTES) expression at both mRNA and protein levels, but not IL-17 or IL-31. ECP and EDN also upregulate MMP9 production. Inhibiting MMP9, we confirmed that keratinocyte expression of IL-5, eotaxin-1, and RANTES was independent from MMP9. Both ECP and EDN were cytotoxic to keratinocytes, inducing ROS formation and apoptosis through a mitochondrion-dependent pathway as evidenced by results of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and cytochrome c release assays, respectively. ECP but not EDN led to significant keratinocyte detachment from provisional matrix. These findings demonstrate that the pathogenic effects of ECP and EDN in BP may result from their direct action on keratinocytes, and as such may became a target for future therapies in eosinophil rich cutaneous diseases.

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND Studies on the chondrocyte inflammatory injury are very important for understanding the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Evidence suggests that N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) may be used as an adjuvant therapy alongside established methods of OA treatment. This study investigated the effect of NMP on chondrocyte inflammatory injury and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS To mimic the inflammatory injury in vitro, the articular chondrocyte line ATDC5 was simulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ATDC5 cells were treated with various concentrations of NMP (0, 5, and 10 nM). Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 assay; cell apoptosis was detected using FCM; related protein and mRNA expressions were determined using Western blot assay and qRT-PCR assay; and inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) productions were measured by performing ELISA assay. RESULTS The results showed that LPS simulation repressed ATDC5 cell viability, prompted cell apoptosis, and enhanced the secretion of inflammatory factors. NMP treatment reduced inflammatory injury induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, NMP inhibited the activation of JNK and p38 pathways. In addition, inhibition of NF-κB activation was observed following NMP treatment. CONCLUSIONS NMP prevents inflammatory reaction of articular chondrocytes via repressing the MAPK/NF-kB pathway. Our findings provide a promising therapeutic agent for OA treatment.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The functionality of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is modulated by phosphorylation, eEF2 is simultaneously the molecular target of ADP-ribosylating toxins. We analyzed the interplay between phosphorylation and diphthamide-dependent ADPribosylation. Phosphorylation does not require diphthamide, eEF2 without it still becomes phosphorylated. ADP-ribosylation not only modifies the H715 diphthamide but also inhibits phosphorylation of S595 located in proximity to H715, and stimulates phosphorylation of T56. S595 can be phosphorylated by CDK2 and CDK1 which affects EEF2K-mediated T56- phosphorylation. Thus, ADP-ribosylation and S595-phosphorylation by kinases occur within the same vicinity and both trigger T56-phosphorylation. Diphthamide is surface-accessible permitting access to ADP-ribosylating enzymes, the adjacent S595 side chain extends into the interior. This orientation is incompatible with phosphorylation, neither allowing kinase access nor phosphate attachment. S595 phosphorylation must therefore be accompanied by structural alterations affecting the interface to ADP-ribosylating toxins. In agreement with that, replacement of S595 with Ala, Glu or Asp prevents ADP-ribosylation. Phosphorylation (starvation) as well as ADP-ribosylation (toxins) inhibit protein synthesis, both affect the S595/H715 region of eEF2, both trigger T57-phosphorylation eliciting similar transcriptional responses. Phosphorylation is short lived while ADP-ribosylation is stable. Thus, phosphorylation of the S595/H715 'modifier region' triggers transient interruption of translation while ADP-ribosylation arrests irreversibly.\"\n",

The use of both culture dependent and independent methods has made possible to determine the microorganisms that constitute this ecosystem. Kefir consumption has been associated with a wide range of functional and probiotic properties that could be attributed to the microorganisms present in kefir and/or to the metabolites synthetized by them during milk fermentation. In this context, the role of microorganisms in kefir health promoting properties is discussed with particular attention to the yeasts contribution as well as bioactive metabolites such as lactic and acetic acid, exopolysaccharides and bioactive peptides.

Wistar rats were treated with or without sitagliptin before DENA treatment. We detected liver weight, blood glucose, and histopathology of the liver. Serum biochemical markers like serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), total bilirubin (TBR), total protein (TPR), and albumin (ALB) were also evaluated. In addition, lipid profile parameters comprising total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein were also measured. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were determined in liver homogenate. Furthermore, the activity of nuclear factor (NF-κB) was also measured. Our results showed that sitagliptin (10 and 20\\u2009mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner expressively decreased the DENA-induced elevation of SGPT, SGOT, SALP, and GGTP. Whereas sitagliptin (10 and 20\\u2009mg/kg) in a dose-dependent mode reduced the level of TBR and increased the TPR and ALB as well as improved the liver histopathology alterations in DENA-exposed rats. Lipid profile was also restored by the sitagliptin (10 and 20\\u2009mg/kg) in a DENA-treated rats. The level of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were suggestively suppressed. Moreover, pretreatment with sitagliptin (10 and 20\\u2009mg/kg) prevented the activation of NF-κB.

      "Abstract :'Current dogma holds that the heart balances energy demand and supply effectively and sustainably by sequestering enough Ca into mitochondria during heartbeats to stimulate metabolic enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC). This process is called excitation-contraction-bioenergetics (ECB) coupling. Recent breakthroughs on the identity of mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU) and its associated proteins have opened up new windows for interrogating the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca homeostasis regulation and its role in ECB coupling. Despite remarkable progresses made in the past 7 years, it has been surprising or \"disappointing\" that germline MCU deficiency in mice with certain genetic background yields viable pups, and knockout of MCU in adult heart does not cause lethality. Moreover, MCU deficiency results in few adverse phenotypes, normal performance, and preserved bioenergetics in the heart at baseline. In this review, we briefly assess the existing literature on mitochondrial Ca homeostasis regulation and then we consider possible explanations for why MCU-deficient mice are spared from energy crisis under physiological conditions. We propose that MCU and/or mitochondrial Ca may have limited ability to set ECB coupling; that other mitochondrial Ca handling mechanisms may play a role; and that extra-mitochondrial Ca may regulate ECB coupling. Since the heart needs to regenerate a significant amount of ATP to assure the perpetual heartbeats, multiple mechanisms likely work in concert to match energy supply with demand.

EAU was induced in B10.A mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). Treatment with TMP778 significantly inhibited the development of EAU, determined by histological examination. In addition, the treatment suppressed the cellular immune response to IRBP, determined by reduced production of IL-17 and IFN-γ, as well as lower percentages of lymphocytes expressing these cytokines, as compared to vehicle-treated controls. The inhibition of IFN-γ expression by TMP778 is unexpected in view of this compound being a selective inhibitor of RORγt. The observation was further confirmed by the finding of reduced expression of the T-bet (Tbx21) gene, the transcription factor for IFN-γ,\\xa0by cells of TMP778-treated mice.

However, the sensitivity of those cells to GCs is regulated by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 (11β-HSD1). In the testes of the toad Rhinella arenarum, the presence of an 11β-HSD similar to type 2 and a cytosolic GR has also been described. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of GCs on amphibian testicular steroidogenesis. In this study, the effects of corticosterone on androgen production, and the activity of two steroidogenic enzymes in toad testes were reported. Corticosterone inhibits androgen production via the GR because the GR antagonist RU486 prevents corticosterone-induced inhibition of testosterone. Corticosterone also reduced the activity of the cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase, C17,20-lyase (Cyp450  ) without affecting the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activity. This effect on Cyp450  was likewise inhibited by RU486. On the other hand, corticosterone had no effect on the amount of steroidogenic acute regulator protein. These results suggest that GCs inhibit steroidogenesis in toad testes by reducing of Cyp450  activity via a GR-mediated mechanism.'\n",

In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

Here we used genetic and pathological methods to evaluate roles of Arabidopsis UBC13 in response to pathogens and environmental stresses. Loss of UBC13 failed to activate the expression of numerous cold-responsive genes and resulted in hypersensitivity to low-temperature stress, indicating that UBC13 is involved in plant response to low-temperature stress. Furthermore, the ubc13 mutant displayed low-temperature-induced and salicylic acid-dependent lesion mimic phenotypes. Unlike typical lesion mimic mutants, ubc13 did not enhance disease resistance against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens, but diminished hypersensitive response and compromised effector-triggered immunity against avirulent bacterial pathogens. UBC13 differently regulates two types of programmed cell death in response to low temperature and pathogen. The lesion mimic phenotype in the ubc13 mutant is partially dependent on SNC1. UBC13 interacts with an F-box protein CPR1 that regulates the homeostasis of SNC1. However, the SNC1 protein level was not altered in the ubc13 mutant, implying that UBC13 is not involved in CPR1-regulated SNC1 protein degradation. Taken together, our results revealed that UBC13 is a key regulator in plant response to low temperature and pathogens.'\n",

Despite these advances, and the increasingly robust evidence for improved clinical outcomes with early escalation of immunotherapies, the underlying cellular immunology of these conditions has received little attention. Therefore, here, we outline the likely roles of T cells and B cells in the generation of autoantibodies, and reflect on how these may guide both current immunotherapy regimes and our future understanding of precision medicine in the field. In addition, we summarise potential mechanisms by which these peripherally-driven immune responses may reach the central nervous system.

The latter comprises proteins not amenable to experimental structure determination by existing means and inaccessible to homology modeling. Hence, the dark proteome has remained largely unappreciated. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that lack rigid 3D structure are a major component of this dark proteome across all three kingdoms of life. Despite lack of structure, IDPs play critical roles in numerous important biological processes. Furthermore, IDPs serve as crucial constituents of proteinaceous membrane-less organelles (PMLOs), where they often serve as drivers and controllers of biological liquid-liquid phase transitions responsible for the PMLO biogenesis. In this perspective, we discuss the role of IDPs in i) the origin of prebiotic life and the evolution of the first independent primordial living unit akin to Tibor Gánti's chemoton, which preceded the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), ii) role in multicellularity and hence, in major evolutionary transitions, and iii), their role in phenotypic switching, and the emergence of new traits and adaptive opportunities via non-genetic, protein-based, mechanisms. The emerging picture suggests that, despite being major constituents of the dark matter, IDPs may be the dark horse in the protein universe. This article is protected by copyright.

      "Abstract :'Several tissue clearing methods have been developed for three-dimensional imaging of thick specimens. Here, we applied CUBIC and ScaleS approaches to whole-mounted vaginal wall to reveal spatial distribution of γδ T lymphocytes - the key cells engaged in the epithelial homeostasis control and immune surveillance. Both methods rendered the tissue transparent and enabled detection of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing γδ T cells in vaginal samples of Tcrd-H2BeGFP transgenic mice. Upon additional immunolabeling, however, only CUBIC preserved GFP signal and allowed for cell localization assessment during the estrous cycle. Using a combination of single- and two-photon microscopy we found that during the diestrus phase the number of γδ T cells in the vaginal wall increased compared to estrus, while proportion of cells residing in epithelium and stroma remained constant, irrespective of the cycle phase, and was close to 3:1, respectively. Moreover, the distance of epithelial γδ T cells to laminin-positive basal membrane and collagen-rich stroma also increased in diestrus in spite of thinning of epithelium upon shedding cornified cells. Our data indicate that γδ T cells sense sex hormone fluxes which influence their number and position them closer to vaginal lumen in the diestrus phase. This article is protected by copyright.

We have also used a novel method to study hydration sites on the surface of these two proteins; this method identifies regions around proteins where desolvation is relatively easy, and these are possible locations where proteins can bind each other. There is a high degree of consistency between the predictions of these two methods. Moreover, we have also identified binding sites on GABARAP for other proteins, and listed possible binding sites for as yet unknown proteins on both GABARAP and the GABA type A receptor intracellular domain.

      "Abstract :'Matrix stiffness is an essential physical microenvironment in solid cancer. However, its influence on cancer stemness still remains elusive. Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCT-116 was cultured in the matrix with various stiffness. The siYAP was applied to detect the changes of stemness markers. The cancer stemness markers, Yes-associated protein (YAP), Lamin A/C and downstream protein molecules, and their activation were measured after the treatment with anti-β1-integrin and FAK inhibitors. In CRC tissue samples, collagen deposition and the expression of α-SMA and CD133 were detected. The study found that the expression level of stemness markers and Lamin A/C increased as the matrix stiffness raised and was regulated by YAP activation in CRC stem cells. Inhibition of β1-integrin and FAK activation in a high stiffness cell culture medium significantly decreased the activation of YAP, PI3K, and AKT. Collagen was highly deposited in the CRC invasive tumor front (ITF), and the expression of CD133 was higher in ITF compared with normal tissue and the tumor cells. Moreover, the expression level of α-SMA was positively correlated with CD133 expression level. Together, our results suggest that activation of YAP in CRC plays an important role in the promotion of cancer stem cell properties by extracellular matrix stiffness in CRC.'\n",

      "Abstract :'AIM: Nitric oxide (NO) prevents the decline of RBC deformability under high altitude and other ischemic and hypoxic conditions, but the clear mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we have carried out a systematic study to find the mechanisms of NO-induced regulation of RBC deformability under hypoxia.\\n\\nMETHODS: NO levels, RBCs membrane elongation index (EI), membrane protein band 3 methemoglobin (MetHb) were determined during hypoxia (0 to 120\\u2009minutes). To validate the role of NO in regulating RBC deformability, tests were also performed with a NO donor (sodium nitroprusside) or a NO synthase inhibitor (l-nitro-arginine methylester) under 60\\u2009minutes hypoxia.\\n\\nRESULTS: Hypoxia for 45\\u2009minutes increased NO levels from 25.65\\u2009±\\u20091.95 to 35.26\\u2009±\\u20092.01\\u2009μmol/L, and there was a plateau after 60\\u2009minutes hypoxia.

In addition, the efficacy of crizotinib in these patients has not been well established.\\n\\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALK rearrangement in NA-NSCLC patients and the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib in these patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: We included NA-NSCLC patients who were tested for the presence of ALK rearrangement in our institution from January 2013 to May 2018. The effectiveness of crizotinib in ALK-positive patients was retrospectively analyzed. A literature review was performed and eligible previously published cases were analyzed in combination with our data.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 4662 patients were screened and 1696 NA-NSCLC patients were tested for the presence of ALK rearrangement during the study period. Thirty-two positive patients were identified (1.9%, 95% CI, 1.2-2.5%).

      "Abstract :\"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the several neurodegenerative diseases where accumulation of aggregated proteins like α-synuclein occurs. Dysfunction in autophagy leading to this protein build-up and subsequent dopaminergic neurodegeneration may be one of the causes of PD. The mechanisms that impair autophagy remain poorly understood. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpiridium ion (MPP) is a neurotoxin that induces experimental PD in vitro. Our studies have shown that glia maturation factor (GMF), a brain-localized inflammatory protein, induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD and that suppression of GMF prevents MPP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, we demonstrate a molecular action of GMF on the autophagic machinery resulting in dopaminergic neuronal loss and propose GMF-mediated autophagic dysfunction as one of the contributing factors in PD progression. Using dopaminergic N27 neurons, primary neurons from wild type (WT), and GMF-deficient (GMF-KO) mice, we show that GMF and MPP enhanced expression of MAPKs increased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers such as phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (p-PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). Further, GMF and MPP reduced Beclin 1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family-interacting protein of 200\\xa0kD (FIP200), and autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) 3, 5, 7, 16L, and 12. The combined results demonstrate that GMF affects autophagy through autophagosome formation with significantly reduced lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1/2, and the number of autophagic acidic vesicles. Using primary neurons, we show that MPP treatment leads to differential expression and localization of p62/sequestosome and in GMF-KO neurons, there was a marked increase in p62 staining implying autophagy deficiency with very little co-localization of α-synuclein and p62 as compared with WT neurons. Collectively, this study provides a bidirectional role for GMF in executing dopaminergic neuronal death mediated by autophagy that is relevant to PD.\"\n",

As the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs predominately in males. DMD is caused by a lack of functional dystrophin protein resulting from mutations in the 2.2-Mb DMD gene, whichdisrupts the reading frame. Care considerations for DMD advocate a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to the management of DMD in order to optimize management of the primary manifestations of DMD as well as any secondary complications that may arise.\\n\\nMETHODS: This review provides an overview of the multidisciplinary clinical management of DMD with regard to the respiratory, cardiology, orthopedic, and nutritional needs of patients with DMD. Recent advances in novel disease-modifying treatments for DMD are also discussed with specific reference to exon skipping and suppression of premature stop codons as promising genetic therapies.\\n\\nRESULTS: The combination of multidisciplinary clinical management alongside novel gene therapiesoffers physicians a powerful armamentarium for the treatment of DMD.'\n",

Twenty patients received house dust mite (HDM) allergen extract for SLIT and twenty patients received placebo randomly. Protein expression of leptin in serum and nasal lavage was tested by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) 1 and 2 years after SLIT treatment, respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human nasal epithelial cell were prepared and stimulated by recombinant leptin after 24 months' SLIT treatment and the induction of Th2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) were detected by ELISA.\\n\\nRESULTS: SLIT treatment decreased the expression of leptin protein in serum and nasal lavage significantly compared with placebo group 1 and 2 years after SLIT treatment. Nasal leptin level was correlated to decreased Th2 response (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) and enhanced Treg (IL-10/TGF-beat) response after 2 years' SLIT. We also found that SLIT decreased the ability of leptin in promoting Th2 cytokines expression by PBMCs and human nasal epithelial cell after 2 years' SLIT treatment.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Changes of leptin expression in serum and nasal lavage may be correlated with Th2/Treg regulation during SLIT.

Thus, the first heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) accumulates in the liver. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from ALA oxidation may be correlated to a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in AIP patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of this relationship have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we investigated the effect of increasing levels of ALA on the expression of proteins related to DNA repair, oxidative stress, apoptosis, proliferation and lipid metabolism. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method, lipoperoxidation was evaluated by a TBA fluorimetric assay and Western blotting was used to assess protein abundance. The data showed that ALA treatment promoted a dose-dependent increase of p53 expression, downregulation of Bcl-2, HMG-CoA reductase and OGG1 and an increase in lipoperoxidation. There was no alteration in the expression of the transcription factor NF-κB, catalase and superoxide dismutase. ALA oxidation products induced protein regulation patterns, suggesting the interconnection of cellular processes, such as the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, redox homeostasis, cell proliferation, lipid metabolism and DNA repair.

In order to reveal the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive process in litchi, we had analyzed the transcriptome of buds before and after low-temperature induction using RNA-seq technology. A key flower bud differentiation associated gene, a homologue of FLORICAULA/LEAFY, was identified and named LcLFY (GenBank Accession No. KF008435). The cDNA sequence of LcLFY encodes a putative protein of 388 amino acids. To gain insight into the role of LcLFY, the temporal expression level of this gene was measured by real-time RT-PCR. LcLFY was highly expressed in flower buds and its expression correlated with the floral developmental stage. Heterologous expression of LcLFY in transgenic tobacco plants induced precocious flowering. Meantime, we investigated the sub-cellular localization of LcLFY.

An important process parameter which affects the capture of target analytes in such immunosensors is the pH of the solution as the target proteins present in the serum samples are charged molecules. Here, we investigated the capture of prostate-specific antigens (PSAs), first in a mixed-analyte system wherein the solution contained two other non-specific proteins along with the target analyte, using the surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. There are no reports on the detection of antigens in a mixed system based on the optimization of the pH values of the carrier fluid, and this is the motivation of the present work. Further, we studied interference effects caused by the presence of these non-specific proteins in the mixed-analyte systems by artificially increasing the ratio of the interfering proteins to that of the target protein. Eventually PSA spiked into the rabbit serum samples was captured through the optimization of the pH of the solution. We could detect PSA in the serum samples when diluted to 100 times or more, where the amounts of other interfering proteins were ~\\u200966 times that of the amount of PSA.

A recombinant trehalose synthase from Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus SK 33.001 (ACTS) was cloned, expressed, and characterized. The recombinant enzyme encoded a protein of 598 amino acids with a molecular mass of 66\\xa0kDa. Gel filtration showed that ACTS is a tetramer in sodium phosphate buffer. The enzyme was metal ion independent and exhibited maximal activity in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 30\\xa0°C. The kinetic investigations resulted in a K value of 120.5\\u2009±\\u20094.5\\xa0mM for maltose and a K value of 343.1\\u2009±\\u200913.8\\xa0mM for trehalose. The catalytic efficiency (V/K) for maltose and trehalose were 0.2 and 0.15\\xa0U\\xa0mg\\xa0mM, respectively. In addition, a cooperative substrate binding was found displayed by the determined Hill coefficients (n) of 2.8 for maltose and 2.1 for trehalose as a substrate, respectively. The final trehalose yield of various maltose concentrations (50-1000\\xa0mM) was constant between 58 and 59%, implying that substrate concentration had no inhibitory influence on ACTS activity.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"We used green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus (PLDMV-GFP) to track PLDMV infection by fluorescence. The virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) of PLDMV-GFP were characterized from papaya plants by next-generation sequencing. The foreign GFP gene inserted into the PLDMV genome was also processed as a viral gene into siRNAs by components involved in RNA silencing. The siRNAs derived from PLDMV-GFP accumulated preferentially as 21- and 22-nucleotide (nt) lengths, and most of the 5'-terminal ends were biased towards uridine (U) and adenosine (A). The single-nucleotide resolution map revealed that vsiRNAs were heterogeneously distributed throughout the PLDMV-GFP genome, and vsiRNAs derived from the sense strand were more abundant than those from the antisense strand. The hotspots were mainly distributed in the P1 and GFP coding region of the antisense strand. In addition, 979 papaya genes targeted by the most abundant 1000 PLDMV-GFP vsiRNAs were predicted and annotated using GO and KEGG classification. Results suggest that vsiRNAs play key roles in PLDMV-papaya interactions. These data on the characterization of PLDMV-GFP vsiRNAs will help to provide insight into the function of vsiRNAs and their host target regulation patterns.\"\n",

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 88 MPA patients, who were first classified and in whom medications was first initiated in our tertiary Hospital. We collected clinical and laboratory data as well as the rate of all-cause mortality. AGR at diagnosis was calculated as a ratio of serum albumin over globulin fraction (protein-albumin). We compared variables between survived and deceased patients. The multivariable Cox hazard model was conducted to appropriately obtain the hazard ratios (HRs). The mean age at diagnosis was 56.3\\xa0years and 24 patients (27.3%) were men. Seven patients died for the mean follow-up period of 49.7\\xa0months.

In this study, we attempted to target thrombolysis and enhance blood clot lysis by generating a construct (pLEGFP-N1-tPA) to integrate tPA gene into the genome of different cell lines. pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct was generated and used to target the tPA gene in different cell lines. The thrombolytic effects mediated by the supernatant from transfected HeLa cells and Linx cells were assessed using plasma thrombus plates. Furthermore, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), which was fused to the tPA gene in the pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct, was analyzed under the fluorescent microscope to assess tPA localization. We also monitored tPA activity and expression in the transfected cell lines. As part of the study, we successfully generated the pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct. The sequence of this construct was verified and the construct was subsequently used to generate the PT67/pLEGFP-N1-tPA cell line. The pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct was also used to transfect HeLa cells and Linx cells. We observed that supernatants from transfected cells were capable of lysing thrombi. In addition, tPA activity and tPA concentration were elevated in the latter supernatants and tPA was rapidly and stably expressed in the transfected cell lines. These results reveal a potentially important thrombolytic role for tPA-targeted gene therapy following cardiac valve replacement.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The unicellular photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was propagated in iron deficiency medium and patterns of growth, photosynthetic efficiency, lipid accumulation, as well as the expression of lipid biosynthetic and photosynthesis-related proteins were analysed and compared with iron-sufficient growth conditions. As expected, the photosynthetic rate was reduced (maximally after 4\\xa0days of growth) as a result of increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Surprisingly, the stress-response protein LHCSR3 was expressed in conditions of iron deficiency that cause NPQ induction. In addition, the protein contents of both the PSI and PSII reaction centres were gradually reduced during growth in iron deficiency medium. Interestingly, the two generations of Fe deficiency cells could be able to recover the photosynthesis but the second generation cells recovered much slower as these cells were severely in shock. Analysis by flow cytometry with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and thin layer chromatography showed that iron deficiency also induced the accumulation of triacylglycerides (TAG), which resulted in the formation of lipid droplets. This was most significant between 48 and 72\\xa0h of growth. Dramatic increases in DGAT2A and PDAT1 levels were caused by iron starvation, which indicated that the biosynthesis of TAG had been increased. Analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry showed that levels of 16:0, 18:0, 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids were significantly elevated. The results of this study highlight the genes/enzymes of Chlamydomonas that affect lipid synthesis through their influence on photosynthesis, and these represent potential targets of metabolic engineering to develop strains for biofuel production.'\n",

Nimbolide also profoundly caused the regression of established inflammation-driven fibrosis, thus demonstrating both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities. Another commendable finding of this study is that nimbolide was able to decrease the levels of LOXL2, a collagen cross-linker, which is aberrantly expressed in scleroderma. Although further mechanistic studies are required, our study displays nimbolide for the first time as a potent antifibrotic agent which can be used as a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of scleroderma.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Periodontal diseases are a major public health problem affecting over half of the adult population worldwide. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines that promote inflammatory bone destruction. Mounting evidence supports that periodontal diseases are involved in the onset and progression of several systemic diseases, such as aspiration pneumonia and diabetes. Although treatment of periodontal diseases by removing the periodontopathic bacteria by brushing is a standard practice, it has limitations and is not effective in all cases. Therefore, a new method to replace or complement brushing is needed for the treatment of periodontal diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of an extract from Cynara scolymus L. and its pharmacologically effective compound cynaropicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone, on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) stimulated by LPS and the potential anti-osteoclastogenic effects on RAW264.7 cells induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). We found that cynaropicrin inhibited IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA and protein synthesis in LPS-stimulated HGFs in a dose-dependent manner. P. gingivalis LPS-induced degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 were also suppressed by cynaropicrin, as was LPS-stimulated NF-κB transactivation. Thus, cynaropicrin's inhibition of P. gingivalis LPS-induced IL-8 and IL-6 expression may be due to the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we showed that cynaropicrin dramatically reduced RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. These results suggest that cynaropicrin may be useful for preventing periodontal diseases and could prove valuable in the development of more effective preventative approaches for periodontal diseases.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are gram-negative bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) in humans, which is characterized by invasion and inflammatory destruction of the human colonic epithelium. Different EIEC and Shigella subgroups rose independently from commensal E. coli through patho-adaptive evolution that included loss of functional genes interfering with the virulence and/or with the intracellular lifestyle of the bacteria, as well as acquisition of genetic elements harboring virulence genes. Among the latter is the large virulence plasmid encoding for a type three secretion system (T3SS), which enables translocation of virulence proteins (effectors) from the bacterium directly into the host cell cytoplasm. These effectors enable the pathogen to subvert epithelial cell functions, promoting its own uptake, replication in the host cytosol, and dissemination to adjacent cells while concomitantly inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell death. Furthermore, T3SS effectors are directly involved in Shigella manipulation of immune cells causing their dysfunction and promoting cell death. In the current chapter, we first describe the evolution of the enteroinvasive pathovars and then summarize the overall knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of these bacteria, with a particular focus on Shigella flexneri. Subversion of host cell functions in the human gut, both epithelial and immune cells, by different virulence factors is especially highlighted.'\n",

      "Abstract :'MMP-11 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family (MMPs) which are overexpressed in cancer cells, stromal cells and the adjacent microenvironment. The MMP protein family encompasses zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM), facilitating the breakdown of the basal membrane and matrix connective tissues. This function is believed to be important in cancer development and metastasis. This paper investigated a gold nanoparticle-based immunohistochemical assay to visualise the distribution of MMP-11 in human breast cancer tissues from eight patients with and without metastases by employing laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The expression of MMP-11 was increased and more heterogeneous in metastatic specimens compared to non-metastatic tumour samples. These findings demonstrate that imaging breast tumours by LA-ICP-MS may be a useful tool to aid the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. As an example, samples of two patients are presented who were diagnosed with matching characteristics and grades of breast cancer. Although both patients had a similar prognosis and treatment, only one developed metastases.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of μ-droplets is becoming an attractive alternative for detecting and quantifying elements in biological samples. With minimal sample preparation required and detection limits comparable to solution nebulisation ICP-MS, μ-droplets have substantial advantages over traditional elemental detection, particularly for low volumes, such as aliquots taken from samples required for multiple independent biochemical assays, or fluids and tissues where elements of interest exist at native concentrations not suited to the necessary dilution steps required for solution nebulisation ICP-MS. However, the characteristics of μ-droplet residue deposition are heavily dependent on the matrix, and potential effects on signal suppression or enhancement have not been fully characterised. We present a validated and flexible high-throughput method for quantification of elements in μ-droplets using LA-ICP-MS imaging and matrix-matched external calibrants. Imaging the entire μ-droplet area removes analytical uncertainty arising from the often-heterogenous distribution when compared to radial or bisecting line scans that capture only a small portion of the droplet residue. We examined the effects of common matrices found in a standard biochemistry workflow, including native protein and salt contents, as well as reagents used in typical preparation steps for concurrent biochemical assays, such as total protein quantification and enzyme activity assays. We found that matrix composition results in systemic, concentration-dependent signal enhancement and suppression for carbon, whereas high sodium content has a specific space-charge-like suppression effect on high masses. We confirmed the accuracy of our method using both a certified serum standard (Seronorm™ L1) and independent measurements of analysed samples by solution nebulisation ICP-MS, then tested the specificity and reproducibility by examining spinal cord tissue homogenates from SOD1-G93A transgenic mice with a known molecular phenotype of increased copper- and zinc-binding superoxide dismutase-1 expression and altered copper-to-zinc stoichiometry. The method presented is rapid and transferable to multiple other biological matrices and allows high-throughput analysis of low-volume samples with sensitivity comparable to standard solution nebulisation ICP-MS protocols.

The purpose of this study was to investigate more valuable indices and determine their sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis of coronary involvement in KD. We performed this retrospective study in 218 children. All patients underwent laboratory and echocardiographic evaluations upon admission. We measured the size of the left main coronary artery (LMA), left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), and aorta (Ao), and calculated the LMA/Ao, LAD/Ao, and RCA/Ao ratios. We also calculated the cut-off values of each index using receiver operating characteristic curves. LMA, LAD, and RCA measurements did not correlate with white blood cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or brain natriuretic peptide level. The LMA measurement was associated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron saturation. LAD/Ao was correlated with white blood cell and platelet counts (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), whereas RCA/Ao was correlated with ferritin level (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The cut-off value of LMA/Ao was 0.2, with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 70%. Individual coronary artery/Ao ratios might provide helpful insight for detection of coronary abnormality in KD in the acute phase. Further investigation is essential to clarify prompt early diagnosis of coronary involvement in KD.'\n",

Here, we investigated the association between BsmI, ApaI, TaqI and FokI VDR polymorphisms and the severity of liver cirrhosis in relation to serum cytokine and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) levels and their role on survival in cirrhotic patients. We found that patients harboring the BB genotype had higher MELD score, and they were mainly at CP stage C; patients harboring the AA genotype had increased LBP, IL-1β and IL-8 levels, and they were mostly at CP stage C; TT genotype carriers had higher MELD score and they were mainly at CP stage C and FF genotype carriers had lower IL-1β levels when compared to Bb/bb, Aa/aa, Tt/tt and Ff/ff genotypes respectively. In the multivariate analysis ApaI, BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms were independently associated with liver cirrhosis severity. In the survival analysis, the independent prognostic factors were CP score, MELD and the FF genotype. Our results indicate that the ApaI, TaqI and BsmI polymorphisms are associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis, through the immunoregulatory process. Survival is related to the FF genotype of FokI polymorphism, imparting a possible protective role in liver cirrhosis.'\n"

We have recently re-engineered the MS2 system for accurate detection of mRNAs in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous MS2 systems affected the degradation of the tagged mRNA, which led to accumulation of MS2 fragments and to erroneous conclusions about mRNA localization and expression. Here we describe a step-by-step protocol for the use of our latest MS2 system (MBSV6) for detecting endogenously tagged mRNAs using wide-field fluorescent microscopy in living yeast. The procedure is divided into three stages: tagging of endogenous gene with MBSV6 (~2 weeks), a two-color single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) procedure to quantitatively assess whether mRNAs tagged with MS2 and MS2-coat protein (MCP) behave like untagged mRNAs (2 d, plus additional time for quantification), and a procedure to quantify single mRNAs by live imaging using wide-field microscopy (1 d, plus additional time for quantification). With this method it is now possible to interrogate all phases of mRNA expression, from transcription through decay. The described protocol is designed for S. cerevisiae; however, we think that our approach and the considerations discussed here can be extended to Escherichia coli, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells.'\n",

This modification has previously been shown to alter the export kinetics for mRNAs though the molecular details surrounding this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Recruitment of the TREX mRNA export complex to mRNA is driven by transcription, 5' capping and pre-mRNA splicing. Here we identify a fourth mechanism in human cells driving the association of TREX with mRNA involving the mA methylase complex. We show that the mA complex recruits TREX to mA modified mRNAs and this process is essential for their efficient export. TREX also stimulates recruitment of the mA reader protein YTHDC1 to the mRNA and the mA complex influences the interaction of TREX with YTHDC1. Together our studies reveal a key role for TREX in the export of mA modified mRNAs.\"\n",

Nonetheless, in the absence of guide RNA, Cbf5 catalyzes the in vitro formation of Ψ in Pyrococcus abyssi 23S rRNA and of Ψ in tRNAs. Using gene-disrupted strains of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, we studied the in vivo contribution of proteins Nop10 and Gar1 to the dual RNA guide-dependent and RNA-independent activities of Cbf5 on 23S rRNA. The single-null mutants of the cbf5, nop10, and gar1 genes are viable, but display a thermosensitive slow growth phenotype. We also generated a single-null mutant of the gene encoding Pus10, which has redundant activity with Cbf5 for in vitro formation of Ψ in tRNA. Analysis of the presence of Ψs within the rRNA peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the mutants demonstrated that Cbf5 but not Pus10 is required for rRNA modification. Our data reveal that, in contrast to Nop10, Gar1 is crucial for in vivo and in vitro RNA guide-independent formation of Ψ (Ψ in P. abyssi) by Cbf5. Furthermore, our data indicate that pseudouridylation at orphan position 2589 (2585 in P. abyssi), for which no PUS or guide sRNA has been identified so far, relies on RNA- and Gar1-dependent activity of Cbf5.'\n",

However, the mechanism underlying its anti-cancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether and how hispidulin-induced apoptosis of human HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that hispidulin (10, 20\\u2009μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in human HCC SMMC7721 cells and Huh7 cells. More importantly, we revealed that its pro-apoptotic effects depended on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and unfolded protein response (UPR), as pretreatment with salubrinal, a selective ERS inhibitor, or shRNA targeting a UPR protein CHOP effectively abrogated hispidulin-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that hispidulin-induced apoptosis was mediated by activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway as pretreatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or AMPK-targeting siRNA reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of hispidulin. In HCC xenograft nude mice, administration of hispidulin (25, 50\\u2009mg\\u2009kg\\u2009d, ip, for 27 days) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor growth, accompanied by inducing ERS and apoptosis in tumor tissue.

Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are widely recognized for their role in stress response signal transduction in eukaryotes. To assess the correlation between MAPK activation and lipid productivity, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was studied under various concentrations of NaCl. The results demonstrated that C. reinhardtii exhibits elevated levels of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activities after undergoing osmotic stress, as well as an increase in cellular lipid content. To establish a more direct causal link between both kinases and lipid productivity, C. reinhardtii was subjected to biochemically induced regulation of ERK and JNK pathways. Activating the MEK-ERK pathway via C6 ceramide treatment increased ERK activation and lipid production simultaneously, while PD98059 mediated inhibition of the pathway yielded opposite results. Interestingly, suppression of the JNK pathway with SP600125 resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability under osmotic stress. These results suggest that ERK and JNK MAP kinases have important roles in microalgal lipid accumulation and cell growth under osmotic stress, respectively.'\n",

In humans, it has been suggested that COMT modulates cognitive ability, possibly by regulating degradation of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. Hence, it is significant that two COMT SNPs, rs4680 (c.472\\u2009G\\u2009>\\u2009A, p.Val158Met) and rs4818 (c.408\\u2009C\\u2009>\\u2009G), have been associated with cognitive ability in humans. We have shown these SNPs to be associated with levels of muscarinic M1 receptor mRNA in human cortex, which is significant as that receptor also regulates cognitive ability. We decided to determine if COMT genotype was associated with varying levels of COMT protein, as this could be a mechanism by which COMT genotype could be associated with changes in muscarinic M1 receptor mRNA levels. Hence, we measured COMT levels in prefrontal cortex obtained postmortem from 199 subjects, some of whom had a history of schizophrenia, major depressive disorders or bipolar disorders. Our data show, independent of diagnostic status, that genotype at rs4680 and rs4818, but not at rs737865 and rs165599, is associated with differing levels of soluble COMT (S-COMT), but not membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT). These findings suggest that the association between COMT polymorphisms and cognitive functioning could be, at least in part, due to their association with varying levels of S-COMT. This is important as, unlike MB-COMT, the substrates targeted by S-COMT are likely to be intra-cellular rather than, like dopamine, located mainly in the synaptic vesicles or the extra-cellular space.'\n"

The TNF receptor Fn14 participates in multiple intracellular signaling pathways and is strongly induced upon tissue injury and solid tumorigenesis. While Fn14 is a short-lived protein, the regulation of its levels is largely obscure. Here we uncover a role for autophagy in Fn14 turnover, wherein specific core autophagy Atg8 proteins play distinct roles: Fn14 accumulates in the ERGIC in absence of GABARAP but within endosomes in the vicinity of autophagic membranes in absence of GATE-16. Moreover, GABARAP regulates overall cellular levels of Fn14, whereas GATE-16 regulates TWEAK signaling by Fn14 and thereby NF-κB activity. These findings not only implicate different Atg8 proteins in distinct roles within the mechanism of selective autophagic regulation of Fn14, but may also provide a more general view of their role in mediating autophagosome biogenesis from different membrane sources.'\n",

Kartogenin (KGN) is a small drug-like molecule that induces chondrogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This study aimed to identify whether KGN can enhance severe pain behavior and improve cartilage repair in OA rat model. Induction of OA model was loaded by IA-injection of MIA. In the OA rat model, treatment an intra-articular injection of KGN. Pain levels were evaluated by analyzing PWL and PWT response in animals. Histological analysis and micro-CT images of femurs were used to analyze cartilage destruction. Gene expression was measured by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry was analyzed to detect protein expression. KGN injection significantly decreased pain severity and joint destruction in the MIA-induced OA model. KGN also increased mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in OA patients' chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1β. Decreased chondroclast expression, and increased Treg cell expression.

Immunoprecipitation high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) showed DCE-2.5- (equivalent to 2.5 cups of coffee a day) and DCE-5-induced protein expression that was beneficial to human health, i.e., they led to significant increases in proliferation-, immunity-, cellular protection-, antioxidant signaling-, and osteogenesis-related proteins but decreases in inflammation-, NFkB signaling-, cellular apoptosis-, and oncogenic signaling-related proteins in RAW 264.7 cells, and slight decreases in angiogenesis-related proteins in HUVECs. These protein expression changes were less frequently observed for DCE-10 treatment, while AC treatment induced very different changes in protein expression. We suggest that the favorable cellular effects of DCE were derived from minor coffee elements that were absent in AC, and that the reduced effects of DCE-10 compared with those of DCE-2.5 or DCE-5 might have been caused by greater adverse reactions to caffeine and chlorogenic acid in DCE-10 than DCE-2.5 or DCE-5.

We found that UPF1, a highly processive helicase central to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), tightly holds onto NA, allowing long lasting action. Conversely, the structurally similar IGHMBP2 helicase has a short residence time. UPF1 mutants with variable grip on DNA show that grip tightness dictates helicase residence time and processivity. In addition, we discovered via functional studies that a decrease in UPF1 grip impairs NMD efficiency in vivo. Finally, we propose a three-state model with bound, sliding and unbound molecular clips, that can accurately predict the modulation of helicase processivity.'\n",

The variants of the Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) gene have probably been selected by malaria parasites, particularly the FY*O allele, which is fixed in sub-Saharan Africa and confers resistance to Plasmodium vivax infection. Here, we showed the influence of genomic ancestry on the distribution of DARC genotypes in a highly admixed Brazilian population and confirmed the decreased susceptibility of the FY*A/FY*O genotype to clinical P. vivax malaria. FY*B/FY*O individuals were associated with a greater risk of developing clinical malaria. A remarkable difference among DARC variants concerning the susceptibility to clinical malaria was more evident for individuals who were less exposed to malaria, as measured by the time of residence in the endemic area. Additionally, we found that DARC-negative and FY*A/FY*O individuals had a greater chance of acquiring high levels of antibodies against the 19-kDa C-terminal region of the P. vivax merozoite surface protein-1. Altogether, our results provide evidence that DARC polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to clinical P. vivax malaria and influence the naturally-acquired humoral immune response to malaria blood antigens, which may interfere with the efficacy of a future vaccine against malaria.'\n",

By a series of in vitro assays in colorectal cancer cell lines, we showed that the anti-tumorigenic properties of the OPCs-curcumin combination were superior to the effects of individual compounds. By RNA-sequencing based gene-expression profiling in six colorectal cancer cell lines, we identified the cooperative modulation of key cancer-associated pathways such as DNA replication and cell cycle pathways. Moreover, several pathways, including protein export, glutathione metabolism and porphyrin metabolism were more effectively modulated by the combination of OPCs and curcumin. We validated genes belonging to these pathways, such as HSPA5, SEC61B, G6PD, HMOX1 and PDE3B to be cooperatively modulated by the OPCs-curcumin combination. We further confirmed that the OPCs-curcumin combination more potently suppresses colorectal carcinogenesis and modulated expression of genes identified by RNA-sequencing in mice xenografts and in colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids. Overall, by delineating the cooperative mechanisms of action of OPCs and curcumin, we make a case for the clinical co-administration of curcumin and OPCs as a treatment therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.'\n"

P is sensed in bacteria and yeast at the plasma membrane, which activates intracellular signal transduction to control the expression of P transporters and other genes that control intracellular P levels. In multicellular organisms, P homeostasis must be maintained in the organism and at the cellular level, requiring an endocrine and metabolic P-sensing mechanism, about which little is currently known. This Review will discuss the metabolic effects of P, which are mediated by P transporters, inositol pyrophosphates and SYG1-Pho81-XPR1 (SPX)-domain proteins to maintain cellular phosphate homeostasis in the musculoskeletal system. In addition, we will discuss how P is sensed by the human body to regulate the production of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), parathyroid hormone and calcitriol to maintain serum levels of P in a narrow range. New findings on the crosstalk between iron and P homeostasis in the regulation of FGF23 expression will also be outlined. Mutations in components of these metabolic and endocrine phosphate sensors result in genetic disorders of phosphate homeostasis, cardiomyopathy and familial basal ganglial calcifications, highlighting the importance of this newly emerging area of research.'\n",

Therefore, we investigated whether Bcl-2 plays a role in CS-induced mucous expression. Primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) of murine and human origin were treated with CS extract (CSE), and there was a concentration- and time-dependent increase in secretory mucin (MUC5AC), mucous regulator (SPDEF) and Bcl-2 expression. Using differentiated human AECs cultured on air-liquid interface, EGFR and ERK1/2 pathways were interrogated. Bcl-2 activity was blocked using a small molecule BH3 mimetic ABT-263 that disrupts the Bcl-2 interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins. The ABT-263 treatment resulted in the downregulation of CSE-induced mucus expression and disrupted the EGFR-signaling while inducing the apoptosis and the pro-apoptotic protein, Bik expression. This strategy significantly suppressed the mainstream CS-induced mucous phenotype in a 3-D human airway epithelium model. Therefore, the present study suggests that CS induces Bcl-2 expression to help promote mucous cell survival; and small molecule BH3 mimetics targeting Bcl-2 could be useful in suppressing the CS-induced mucous response.'\n",

PASK (PAS Domain Kinase) is a nutrient and bioenergetic sensor. We contend that PASK could act as an oxidative stress sensor in liver and/or control the metabolic balance, playing a role in the mitochondrial homeostasis. Using PASK-deficient mice, we observed that PASK deficiency promotes antioxidant response mechanisms: a lower production of ROS/RNS under non-fasting conditions, overexpression of genes coding to ROS-detoxifying enzymes and mitochondrial fusion proteins (MnSod Gpx, Mfn1 and Opa1), coactivator Ppargc1a, transcription factors (Pparg and FoxO3a) and deacetylase Sirt1. Also, under fasting conditions, PASK deficiency induced the overexpression of Ppargc1a, Ppara, Pparg, FoxO3a and Nrf2 leading to the overexpression of genes coding to antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, GPx, HO1 and GCLm. Additionally, inducing PINK1 involved in cell survival and mitophagy. These changes kept ROS steady levels and improved the regenerative state. We suggest a new role for PASK as a controller of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics in the liver. In fact, antioxidant response is PASK dependent. PASK-targeting could therefore be a good way of reducing the oxidative stress in order to prevent or treat liver diseases.'\n",

Some differences in hypoxia sensitivity and chondrogenesis were observed. UCB-MSCs differentiated into chondrocytes express an abundant, dense and a hyaline-like cartilage matrix.

Both MSCs types also displayed intrinsic differences at their undifferentiated basal status, UCB-MSCs expressing higher levels of chondrogenic markers whereas UCM-MSCs synthesizing higher amounts of osteogenic markers.

      "Abstract :'While protein concentrations are physiologically most relevant, measuring them globally is challenging. mRNA levels are easier to measure genome-wide and hence are typically used to infer the corresponding protein abundances. The steady-state condition (assumption that protein levels remain constant) has typically been used to calculate protein concentrations, as it is mathematically convenient, even though it is often not satisfied. Here, we propose a method to estimate genome-wide protein abundances without this assumption. Instead, we assume that the system returns to its baseline at the end of the experiment, which is true for cyclic phenomena (e.g. cell cycle) and many time-course experiments. Our approach only requires availability of gene expression and protein half-life data. As proof-of-concept, we predicted proteome dynamics associated with the budding yeast cell cycle, the results are available for browsing online at http://dynprot.cent.uw.edu.pl/ . The approach was validated experimentally by verifying that the predicted protein concentration changes were consistent with measurements for all proteins tested. Additionally, if proteomic data are available as well, we can also infer changes in protein half-lives in response to posttranslational regulation, as we did for Clb2, a post-translationally regulated protein. The predicted changes in Clb2 abundance are consistent with earlier observations.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The upper airway - which consists mainly of the naso- and oro-pharynx - is the first point of contact between the respiratory system and microbial organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment. It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n\\u2009=\\u20096) and B (n\\u2009=\\u20094) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n\\u2009=\\u200983). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3\\u2009h and 6\\u2009h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway. We have developed a sensitive systems-level proteomic assay for the systematic quantification of naso-oro-pharyngeal proteins. The assay will advance mechanistic studies of respiratory pathology, by providing an untargeted and hypothesis-free approach of examining the airway proteome.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"In mammalian cells, one-third of all polypeptides are transported into or across the ER membrane via the Sec61 channel. While the Sec61 complex facilitates translocation of all polypeptides with amino-terminal signal peptides (SP) or transmembrane helices, the Sec61-auxiliary translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex supports translocation of only a subset of precursors. To characterize determinants of TRAP substrate specificity, we here systematically identify TRAP-dependent precursors by analyzing cellular protein abundance changes upon TRAP depletion using quantitative label-free proteomics. The results are validated in independent experiments by western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and complementation analysis. The SPs of TRAP clients exhibit above-average glycine-plus-proline content and below-average hydrophobicity as distinguishing features. Thus, TRAP may act as SP receptor on the ER membrane's cytosolic face, recognizing precursor polypeptides with SPs of high glycine-plus-proline content and/or low hydrophobicity, and triggering substrate-specific opening of the Sec61 channel through interactions with the ER-lumenal hinge of Sec61α.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The selective removal of undesired or damaged mitochondria by autophagy, known as mitophagy, is crucial for cellular homoeostasis, and prevents tumour diffusion, neurodegeneration and ageing. The pro-autophagic molecule AMBRA1 (autophagy/beclin-1 regulator-1) has been defined as a novel regulator of mitophagy in both PINK1/PARKIN-dependent and -independent systems. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 as a key inducing factor in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy, a process that takes place independently of the main mitophagy receptors. Furthermore, we show that mitophagy function of AMBRA1 is post-translationally controlled, upon HUWE1 activity, by a positive phosphorylation on its serine 1014. This modification is mediated by the IKKα kinase and induces structural changes in AMBRA1, thus promoting its interaction with LC3/GABARAP (mATG8) proteins and its mitophagic activity. Altogether, these results demonstrate that AMBRA1 regulates mitophagy through a novel pathway, in which HUWE1 and IKKα are key factors, shedding new lights on the regulation of mitochondrial quality control and homoeostasis in mammalian cells.'\n",

By developing interaction selection in liquid-gels and using an ORF sequence-based readout of interactions via next-generation sequencing, we eliminate laborious plating and barcoding steps required by existing methods. We use rec-Y2H to simultaneously map interactions of protein domains and reveal novel putative interactors of PAR proteins.

The distal segment accommodates key functions, including cilium assembly and sensory activities. While the middle segment contains doublet microtubules (incomplete B-tubules fused to complete A-tubules), the distal segment contains only A-tubule extensions, and its existence requires coordination of microtubule length at the nanometer scale. We show that three conserved proteins, two of which are mutated in the ciliopathy Joubert syndrome, determine the geometry of the distal segment, by controlling the positions of specific microtubule ends. FAP256/CEP104 promotes A-tubule elongation. CHE-12/Crescerin and ARMC9 act as positive and negative regulators of B-tubule length, respectively.

Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDPK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin's cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.\"\n",

Sixty patients were randomly assigned to the NAC group ( = 30) or the control group ( = 30) to receive inhaled NAC or sterilized water, respectively, for 30 min before surgery and 3 h after reperfusion. The incidence of early PPCs and outcomes including survival rate were assessed. Biomarkers including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8, Clara cell secretory protein (CC16), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) at T1 (before surgery) and T2 (at the end of operation) as well as in serum at T1, T2, T3 (12 h after operation), and T4 (24 h after operation). A total of 42 patients (20 in the NAC group and 22 in the control group) were enrolled in the final analysis. Atomization inhaled NAC significantly reduced the incidence of PPCs after OLT. The levels of TNF-α, IL-8, CC16, and ICAM-1 in EBC were significantly lower, and SOD activity was higher, at T2 in the NAC group; similar data were found in serum at T2, T3, and T4.

      "Abstract :'The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a classical iodide pump typically localized within the cell plasma membrane in thyroid cells, where NIS expression is believed to ensure success of mainstay radioiodide therapy in thyroid cancers. Although radioiodide uptake is generally reduced in thyroid cancer tissue, intracellular non-membranous NIS has been reported to increase, suggesting that NIS serves a pump-independent function. Thyroid cancer is one of the major component cancers of Cowden syndrome, a subset of which is caused by germline mutations in PTEN. In this study, we explored the non-canonical tumorigenic role of NIS in thyroid cancer cells in relation to PTEN signaling. PTEN knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines stabilized intracellular NIS protein by promoting an interaction with NIS-LARG (leukemia associated RhoA guanine exchange factor). Increased protein levels of cytoplasmic NIS enhanced RhoA activation and resulted in a pro-migration tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of NIS glycosylation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contributed to mislocalization of NIS in the cytoplasm, facilitating its non-pump tumorigenic function through an interaction with LARG, which predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, PTEN or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could affect DPAGT1, a glycosylating enzyme involved in the initial step of N-linked glycosylation, to inhibit glycosylation of NIS. In summary, our results elucidate a pump-independent, pro-tumorigenic role for NIS in thyroid cancer via its crosstalk with PTEN signaling.'\n",

Most MDM2 inhibitors under development target MDM2-p53 binding and have little or no effect on cancers without functional p53, including pancreatic cancer. Some available compounds indirectly inhibit NFAT1 activity by interfering with calcineurin activity, but there are currently no specific inhibitors against NFAT1. Here we performed a high-throughput virtual and cell-based screening to yield a lead compound (MA242) that can directly bind both MDM2 and NFAT1 with high affinity, induce their protein degradation, and inhibit NFAT1-mediated transcription of  As a result of this binding, MA242 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines regardless of p53 status. MA242 alone or in combination with gemcitabine inhibited pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis without any host toxicity. Our data indicate that targeting both MDM2 and NFAT1 represents a novel and effective strategy to treat pancreatic cancer.

Among many genetic variants identified in hypertension, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was found to play important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension and associated diseases. We therefore explore the possible role of HSP70 polymorphisms and their interaction with occupational environment in hypertension risk.\\n\\nMETHODS: We carried out a case-control study among 367 coke oven workers in northwest China, focused on three common HSP70 polymorphisms (HSP70-1 G190C, HSP70-2 A1267G and HSP70-hom T2437C), and evaluated the association of HSP70 gene polymorphisms with work sites for high risk of hypertension.\\n\\nRESULTS: The results indicated that HSP70-1 GC and CC genotype had 2.73-fold and 4.26-fold increased relative risk (95%\\u2009CI 1.33 to 5.55 and 1.17 to 15.53), respectively, comparing with HSP70-1 GG genotype.

      "Abstract :\"Catalysis of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gives rise to a single product that serves as a precursor for all prostaglandins, which are central mediators of inflammation. Rapid upregulation of COX-2 expression in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli is a well-characterized means of generating the large pool of prostaglandins necessary for inflammation. However, an efficient inflammatory process must also terminate rapidly and thus requires cessation of COX-2 enzymatic activity and removal of excess protein from the cell. Previous studies showed that COX-2 that has not been exposed to AA ('naïve') degrades in the cellular proteasome. However, continuous exposure to AA induces suicide inactivation of COX-2 and its elimination no longer occurs in neither the proteasomal nor lysosomal machineries. In this study we show that either overexpressed or endogenously-induced COX-2 is secreted via exosomes through the ER-Golgi pathway. We further find that excretion of COX-2 is significantly enhanced by prolonged exposure to AA. Genetic or chemical inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity has no effect on its secretion in the absence of substrate, but prevents the additional activity-dependent secretion. Finally, transfer of COX-2 to target cells only occur in the absence of AA stimulation. Together these results suggest that exosomal secretion of AA-activated COX-2 constitutes a means to remove damaged inactive COX-2 from the cell.\"\n",

To understand how different proteins may contribute differently to these assemblies and their functions, it is important to understand the molecular driving forces of phase separation and characterize their phase boundaries and material properties. Experimental studies have shown that intrinsically disordered regions of these proteins are a major driving force, as many of them undergo LLPS in isolation. Previous work on polymer solution phase behavior suggests a potential correspondence between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that can be leveraged to discover relationships between single-molecule properties and phase boundaries. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed coarse-grained framework to calculate the θ temperature [Formula: see text], the Boyle temperature [Formula: see text], and the critical temperature [Formula: see text] for 20 diverse protein sequences, and we show that these three properties are highly correlated. We also highlight that these correlations are not specific to our model or simulation methodology by comparing between different pairwise potentials and with data from other work.

How individual cleavages contribute to changes in protein structure and interactions, and how the mature, conical capsid forms, are poorly understood. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography to determine morphology and high-resolution CA lattice structures for HIV-1 derivatives in which Gag cleavage sites are mutated. These analyses prompt us to revise current models for the crucial maturation switch. Unlike previously proposed, cleavage on either terminus of CA was sufficient, in principle, for lattice maturation, while complete processing was needed for conical capsid formation.

DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and the resulting cross-overs are regulated at multiple levels to prevent overabundance along chromosomes. Meiotic cells coordinate these events between distant sites, but the physical basis of long-distance chromosomal communication has been unknown. We show that DSB hotspots up to ∼200 kb (∼35 cM) apart form clusters via hotspot-binding proteins Rec25 and Rec27 in fission yeast. Clustering coincides with hotspot competition and interference over similar distances. Without Tel1 (an ATM tumor-suppressor homolog), DSB and crossover interference become negative, reflecting coordinated action along a chromosome. These results indicate that DSB hotspots within a limited chromosomal region and bound by their protein determinants form a clustered structure that, via Tel1, allows only one DSB per region. Such a \"roulette\" process within clusters explains the observed pattern of crossover interference in fission yeast. Key structural and regulatory components of clusters are phylogenetically conserved, suggesting conservation of this vital regulation. Based on these observations, we propose a model and discuss variations in which clustering and competition between DSB sites leads to DSB interference and in turn produces crossover interference.'\n",

Through linkage with Danish nationwide registers, we also assessed whether neonatal inflammatory markers were associated with previously demonstrated risk factors for childhood ALL. Children who developed B-cell precursor ALL had significantly lower neonatal concentrations of IL8, soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) α, TGFβ1, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher concentrations of IL6, IL17, and IL18 compared with matched controls. Concentrations of IL10 were below the detection level for both patients and controls. Birth order (IL18 and CRP), gestational age (sIL6Rα, TGFβ1, and CRP), and sex (sIL6Rα, IL8, and CRP), but not maternal age, infections during pregnancy, birth weight nor mode of delivery were significantly associated with the neonatal concentrations of inflammatory markers. Our findings support the hypothesis that children who later develop B-cell precursor ALL are born with a dysregulated immune function. Children who develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia are immunologically distinct at birth and could potentially react abnormally to infections in early childhood. .'\n",

Amino acid attachment also gives tRNA access to non-ribosomal cellular activities. However, the normal attachment is via an ester linkage between the carboxylic group of the amino acid and the 3'-hydroxyl of the terminal A76 ribose in tRNA. The instability of this ester linkage has severely hampered studies of aminoacyl-tRNAs. Although the use of 3'-amino-3'-deoxy A76 in a 3'-amino-tailed tRNA provides stable aminoacyl attachment via an amide linkage, there are multiple tailing protocols and the efficiency of each relative to the others is unknown. Here we compare 5 different tailing protocols in parallel, all dependent on the CCA-adding enzyme ((CTP(ATP): tRNA nucleotidyl transferase; abbreviated as the CCA enzyme) to exchange the natural ribose with the modified one. We show that the most efficient protocol is achieved by the CCA-catalyzed pyrophosphorolysis removal of the natural A76 while at the same time adding the appropriate ATP analog to synthesize the modified 3'-end. This protocol for 3'-amino-tailing affords quantitative and stable attachment of a broad range of amino acids to tRNA, indicating its general utility for studies of aminoacyl-tRNAs in both canonical and non-canonical activities.\"\n",

MgrR belongs to Class II sRNAs because its stability in the cell is affected by mutations in Hfq differently than canonical, Class I, sRNAs. Here, we examined the effect of mutations in RNA binding sites of Hfq on the kinetics of the annealing of MgrR to two different target mRNAs, eptB and ygdQ by global data fitting of the reaction kinetics monitored by gel electrophoresis of intermediates and products. The data showed that the mutation on the rim of the Hfq ring trapped MgrR on Hfq preventing the annealing of MgrR to either mRNA. The mutation in the distal face slowed the ternary complex formation and affected the release of MgrR-mRNA complexes from Hfq, while the mutation in the proximal face weakened the MgrR binding to Hfq and in this way affected the annealing. Moreover, competition assays established that MgrR bound to both surfaces of Hfq and competed against other sRNAs. Further studies showed that uridine-rich sequences located in less structurally stable regions served as Hfq binding sites in each mRNA. Overall, the data show that the binding of MgrR sRNA to both faces of the Hfq ring enables it to efficiently anneal to target mRNAs. It also confers on MgrR a competitive advantage over other sRNAs, which could contribute to efficient cellular response to changes in magnesium homeostasis.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Enhanced stability in organic solvents is a desirable feature for enzymes implemented under industrial conditions. Lipases potential as biocatalysts is mainly limited by denaturation in polar alcohols. In this study we focused on selected solvent tunnels in lipase from  T6 to improve its stability in methanol during biodiesel synthesis. Using rational mutagenesis, bulky aromatic residues were incorporated in order to occupy solvent channels and induce aromatic interactions leading to a better inner core packing. Each solvent tunnel was systematically analyzed with respect to its chemical and structural characteristics. Selected residues were replaced with Phe, Tyr or Trp. Overall, 16 mutants were generated and screened in 60% methanol, from which 3 variants showed elevated stability up to 81-fold compared with wild-type. All stabilizing mutations were found in the longest tunnel detected in the \"closed-lid\" x-ray structure. Combining the Phe substitutions created double mutant A187F/L360F with an increase in T of +7°C in methanol and a 3-fold increase in biodiesel synthesis yield from waste chicken oil. Kinetic analysis with -nitrophenyl laurate revealed that all mutants displayed lower hydrolysis rates ( ), though mostly their stability properties determined the transesterification capability. Seven crystal structures of different variants were solved disclosing new π-π or CH/π intramolecular interactions emphasizing the significance of aromatic interactions to improved solvent stability. This rational approach could be implemented in other enzymes for stabilization in organic solvents. Enzymatic synthesis in organic solvents holds increasing industrial opportunities in many fields, however, one major obstacle is the limited stability of biocatalysts in such a denaturing environment. Aromatic interactions play a major role in protein folding and stability and we were inspired by this to re-design enzyme voids. Rational protein engineering of solvent tunnels of lipase from  is presented here, offering a promising approach to introduce new aromatic interactions within the enzyme core. We discovered that longer tunnels leading from the surface to the enzyme active site were more beneficial targets for mutagenesis for improving lipase stability in methanol during biodiesel biosynthesis. Structural analysis of the variants confirmed the generation of new interactions involving aromatic residues. This work provides insights into stability-driven enzyme design by targeting solvent channels void.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"-dominated peatlands play an important role in global carbon storage and represent significant sources of economic and ecological value. While recent efforts to describe microbial diversity and metabolic potential of the  microbiome have demonstrated the importance of its microbial community, little is known about the viral constituents. We used metatranscriptomics to describe the diversity and activity of viruses infecting microbes within the  peat bog. The vegetative portions of 6  plants were obtained from a peatland in northern Minnesota and total RNA extracted and sequenced. Metatranscriptomes were assembled and contigs screened for the presence of conserved virus marker genes. Using bacteriophage capsid protein, gp23, as a marker for phage diversity, we identified 33 contigs representing undocumented phage s that were active in the community at the time of sampling. Similarly, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Virus (NCLDV) major capsid protein were used as markers for ssRNA viruses and NCLDV, respectively. In total 114 contigs were identified as originating from undescribed ssRNA viruses, 22 of which represent near-complete genomes. An additional 64 contigs were identified as being from NCLDVs. Finally, 7 contigs were identified as putative virophage or polinto-like viruses. We developed co-occurrence networks with these markers in relation to the expression of potential-host housekeeping gene  to predict virus-host relationships, identifying 13 groups. Together, our approach offers new tools for the identification of virus diversity and interactions in understudied clades, and suggest viruses may play a considerable role in the ecology of the  microbiome.-dominated peatlands play an important role in maintaining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by modifying conditions in the surrounding soil to favor its own growth over other plant species. This slows rates of decomposition and facilitates the accumulation of fixed carbon in the form of partially decomposed biomass. The unique environment produced by  enriches for the growth of a diverse microbial consortia that benefit from and support the moss's growth, while also maintaining the hostile soil conditions. While a growing body of research has begun to characterize the microbial groups that colonize , little is currently known about the ecological factors that constrain community structure and define ecosystem function. Top-down population control by viruses is almost completely undescribed. This study provides insight into the significant viral influence on the  microbiome, and identifying new potential model systems to study virus-host interactions in the peatland ecosystem.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'When phages infect bacteria cultured in the presence of sub-lethal doses of antibiotics, the sizes of the phage plaques are significantly increased. This phenomenon is known as phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS). In this study, the observation of PAS was extended to a wide variety of bacteria-phage pairs using different classes of antibiotics. PAS was shown in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cells stressed with β-lactam antibiotics filamented or swelled extensively, resulting in increased phage production. PAS was also sometimes observed in the presence of other classes of antibiotics with or without bacterial filamentation. The addition of antibiotics induced  expression in various bacteria, but a -deletion mutant strain of  also showed filamentation and PAS in the presence of quinolone antibiotics. The phage adsorption efficiency did not change in the presence of the antibiotics when the cell surfaces were enlarged as they filamented. Increases in production of phage DNA and mRNAs encoding phage proteins were observed in these cells, with only limited increase in protein production. The data suggest that PAS is the product of a prolonged period of particle assembly due to delayed lysis. The increase in the cell surface area far exceeded the increase in phage holin production in the filamented host cells, leading to a relatively limited availability of intracellular holins for aggregating and forming holes in the host membrane. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress also led to an increased production of phages, while heat stress only showed a limited increase in phage production.Phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) has been reported for a decade. But the underlying mechanism was never vigorously investigated. This study shows the presence of PAS from a variety of phage-bacteria-antibiotic pairs. We show that increased phage production resulted directly from lysis delay caused by relative shortage of holin supply in filamented bacterial host in the presence of sublethal concentration of stress-inducing substances like antibiotics and reactive oxygen species (ROS).'\n",

      "Abstract :'Myxobacteria utilize the catechol natural products myxochelin A and B in order to maintain their iron homeostasis. Recently, the production of these siderophores was reported from the marine bacterium  S2040, along with a new myxochelin derivative named pseudochelin A. The latter features a characteristic imidazoline moiety, which was proposed to originate from an intramolecular condensation reaction of the β-aminoethyl amide group in myxochelin B. To identify the enzyme catalyzing this conversion, we compared the myxochelin regulons of two myxobacterial strains, which solely produce myxochelin A and B, with  S2040. This approach revealed a gene exclusive to the myxochelin regulon in  S2040, coding for an enzyme of the amidohydrolase superfamily. To prove that this enzyme is indeed responsible for the postulated conversion, the reaction was reconstituted  using a hexahistidyl-tagged recombinant protein made in  and myxochelin B as substrate. To test the production of pseudochelin A under  conditions, the amidohydrolase gene was cloned into the myxobacterial plasmid pZJY156 and placed under the control of a copper-inducible promoter. The resulting vector was introduced into the myxobacterium  DSM16526, a native producer of myxochelin A and B. Following the induction with copper, the myxobacterial expression strain was found to synthesize small quantities of pseudochelin A. Replacement of the copper-inducible promoter with the constitutive  promoter led to increased production levels in , which facilitated the isolation and subsequent structural verification of the heterologously produced compound. In this study, an enzyme for imidazoline formation in pseudochelin biosynthesis was identified. Evidence for the involvement of this enzyme in the postulated reaction was obtained after  reconstitution. Furthermore, the function of this enzyme was also demonstrated  by transferring the corresponding gene into the bacterium , which thereby became a producer of pseudochelin A. Aside from clarifying the molecular basis of imidazoline formation in siderophore biosynthesis, we describe the heterologous expression of a gene in a myxobacterium without its chromosomal integration. Due to its metabolic proficiency,  represents an interesting alternative to established host systems for the reconstitution and manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. Since the plasmid used in this study is easily adaptable for the expression of other enzymes as well, we expand the conventional expression strategy for myxobacteria, which is based on the integration of biosynthetic genes into the host genome.'\n"

(Xoo), the bacterial blight pathogen of rice, there are over twenty genes encoding GGDEF, EAL or HD-GYP domains, which are potentially involved in the metabolism of second messenger c-di-GMP. In this study, we focused on characterization of an EAL-domain protein EdpX1. Deletion of  resulted in a two-fold increase of the intracellular c-di-GMP levels, which was restored to the wild-type levels in the complemented strain Δ(pB-), demonstrating EdpX1 is an active phosphodiesterase (PDE) in Xoo. In addition, colorimetric assays further confirmed the PDE activity of EdpX1 by showing that mutation of E153A at the EAL motif strongly reduced its activity. Virulence assays on the leaves of susceptible rice showed that Δ was severely impaired in causing disease symptoms.  expression of wild-type , but not , was able to complement the weakened virulence phenotype. These results indicated that an active EAL domain is required for EdpX1 to regulate the virulence of Xoo. We then demonstrated that Δ was defective in secreting exopolysaccharide (EPS) and forming biofilm. Expression of  in Δ, but not  restored the defective phenotypes to near wild-type level. In addition, we observed that EdpX1-GFP exhibited multiple subcellular localization foci, and this pattern was dependent on its transmembrane (TM) region, which did not seem to directly contribute to the regulatory function of EdpX1. Thus, we concluded that EdpX1 exhibits PDE activity to control c-di-GMP level, and its EAL domain is necessary and sufficient for its regulation on virulence in Xoo. Bacteria utilize c-di-GMP as a second messenger to regulate various biological functions. The synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP are catalyzed by GGDEF domains and EAL or HD-GYP domains, respectively. Multiple genes encoding these domains are often found in one bacterial strain. For example, in the genome of Xoo PXO99, 26 genes encoding proteins containing these domains were identified. Therefore, to fully appreciate the complexity and specificity of c-di-GMP signaling in Xoo, the enzymatic activities and regulatory functions of each GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP domain proteins need to be elucidated. In this study, we showed the EAL-domain protein EdpX1 is a major PDE to regulate diverse virulence phenotypes through the c-di-GMP signaling pathway.'\n",

Recently, their ability to contribute to adaptive immunity has been highlighted. We evaluated the ability of neutrophils from blood to contribute to the adaptive immune response in a preclinical rhesus macaque SIV vaccine trial. Replication-competent adenovirus-SIV recombinants induced neutrophil activation, B cell help markers, and enhanced ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Boosting with SIV vaccines (adjuvant together with ALVAC or DNA plus envelope protein) elicited significant neutrophil responses. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels induced correlated with the frequency of neutrophil subsets expressing IL-21, myeloperoxidase, and CD64. Post-SIV infection, neutrophils exhibited dysfunction, both phenotypically and functionally. B cells from protected and infected macaques cocultured with autologous polymorphonuclear cells, consisting primarily of neutrophils, were activated, underwent class switching, and produced Abs. This B cell help was not aided by addition of IL-10 and was largely contact dependent. Numerous genes associated with inflammation, Ab production, and chemotaxis were upregulated in the cocultured B cells. We conclude that immune stimulation by vaccination or antigenic exposure imparts a greater ability of neutrophils to contribute to the adaptive immune response. Harnessing this granulocytic response has the potential to improve vaccine efficacy.'\n",

To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 55 studies, covering more than half a billion Ab sequences across diverse immune states, organisms (primarily human and mouse), and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated, and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at http://antibodymap.org The data within OAS will be regularly updated with newly released Ig-seq datasets.

      "Abstract :'Drought stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant drought responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H+-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under drought stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis thaliana ABA induces an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711) to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H+-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H+-ATPase activity. Deletion of VAMP711 in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H+-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and drought treatments. In addition, overexpression of VAMP711 partially rescues the drought-sensitive phenotype of ost2-2D, a mutation in AHA1 resulting in a constitutive activated PM H+-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated inhibition of PM H+-ATPase activity and stomatal closure in response to drought stress.'\n",

In HIV-1, specific interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag protein and genomic RNA (gRNA) mediate gRNA dimerization and selective packaging; however, the mechanism for gRNA packaging in HTLV-1, a deltaretrovirus, is unclear. In other deltaretroviruses, the matrix (MA) and NC domains of Gag are both involved in gRNA packaging, but MA binds nucleic acids with higher affinity and has more robust chaperone activity, suggesting that this domain may play a primary role. Here, we show that the MA domain of HTLV-1, but not the NC domain, binds short hairpin RNAs derived from the putative gRNA packaging signal. RNA probing of the HTLV-1 5'leader and crosslinking studies revealed that the primer-binding site and a region within the putative packaging signal form stable hairpins that interact with MA. In addition to a previously identified palindromic dimerization initiation site (DIS), we identified a new DIS in HTLV-1 gRNA and found that both palindromic sequences bind specifically the NC domain. Surprisingly, a mutant partially defective in dimer formation  exhibited a significant increase in RNA packaging into HTLV-1-like particles, suggesting that efficient RNA dimerization may not be strictly required for RNA packaging in HTLV-1. Moreover, the lifecycle of HTLV-1 and other deltaretroviruses may be characterized by NC and MA functions that are distinct from those of the corresponding HIV-1 proteins, but together provide the functions required for viral replication.\"\n",

Herein, we investigated the regulation of the mTORC2 binding partner, mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSin1) in MCs derived from human lung allografts, and identified a novel role for mSin1 during fibrosis. mSin1 was identified as a common downstream target of key fibrotic pathways and its expression was increased in MCs in response to pro-fibrotic mediators - lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-13. Fibrotic-MCs had higher mSin1 protein levels than non-fibrotic MCs and siRNA-mediated silencing of m inhibited collagen I expression and mTORC1/2 activity in these cells. Autocrine LPA signaling contributed to constitutive upregulation of mSin1 in fibrotic-MCs and mSin1 was decreased due to LPA receptor 1 siRNA treatment. We identified c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as a key intermediary in mSin1 upregulation by the pro-fibrotic mediators, as pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of JNK prevented the LPA-induced mSin1 increase. Proteasomal inhibition rescued mSin1 levels after JNK inhibition in LPA-treated MCs, and decrease in mSin1 ubiquitination in response to LPA was counteracted by JNK inhibitors. Constitutive JNK1 overexpression induced mSin1 expression and could drive mTORC2 and mTORC1 activation, and collagen I expression in non-fibrotic MCs; effects that were reversed by siRNA-mediated mSIN1 silencing. These results indicate that LPA stabilizes mSin1 protein expression via JNK signaling by blocking its proteasomal degradation and identify the LPA/JNK/mSin1/mTORC/collagen I pathway as critical for fibrotic activation of MCs.'\n"

A conserved protein, Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), binds to Rif1-binding sequence (Rif1BS) and regulates DNA replication timing. Rif1BS is characterized by the presence of multiple G-tracts, often on both strands, and their unusual spacing. Although previous studies have suggested generation of G4-like structures on duplex Rif1BS, its precise molecular architecture remains unknown. Using gel-shift DNA binding assays and DNA footprinting with various nuclease probes, we show here that both of the Rif1BS strands adopt specific higher-order structures upon heat denaturation. We observed that the structure generated on the G-strand is consistent with a G4 having unusually long loop segments, and that the structure on the complementary C-strand does not have an intercalated motif (i-motif). Instead, we found that the formation of the C-strand structure depends on the G4 formation on the G-strand. Thus, the higher-order structure generated at Rif1BS involved both DNA strands, and in some cases, G4s may form on both of these strands. The presence of multiple G-tracts permitted the formation of alternative structures when some G-tracts were mutated or disrupted by deazaguanine replacement, indicating the robust nature of DNA higher-order structures generated at Rif1BS.

REST represses neuronal gene expression in stem cells and non-neuronal cells, but it is minimally expressed in neuronal cells to ensure proper neuronal development. Dysregulation of REST function has been implicated in several cancers and neurological diseases. Modulating REST gene silencing is challenging since cellular and developmental differences can affect its activity. We therefore considered the possibility of modulating REST activity through its regulatory proteins. The human small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1) regulates the phosphorylation state of REST at sites that function as REST degradation checkpoints. Using kinetic analysis and direct visualization with X-ray crystallography, we show that SCP1 dephosphorylates two degron phosphosites of REST with a clear preference for phosphoserine 861 (pS861). Furthermore, we show that SCP1 stabilizes REST protein levels which sustains REST's gene silencing function in HEK293 cells. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that REST is a bona fide substrate for SCP1  and that SCP1 phosphatase activity protects REST against degradation. These observations indicate that targeting REST via its regulatory protein SCP1 can modulate its activity and alter signaling in this essential developmental pathway.\"\n",

Here, we investigated\\xa0 effects of IGF-1, EGF or NGF on the Bmal-1 promoter in two hypothalamic cell lines. We found that only IGF-1 but not EGF or NGF enhanced activity of the Bmal-1 promoter. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 activity did not affect IGF-1-induced Bmal-1 promoter activation and all three growth factors similarly phosphorylated ERK-1/2, questioning a role for ERK-1/2 in controlling BMAL-1 promoter activity. Of note, only IGF-1 induced sustained phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Moreover, the GSK-3β inhibitor lithium or siRNA-mediated GSK-3β knock-down diminished the effects of IGF-1 on the Bmal-1 promoter. When IGF-1 was used in the context of temperature cycles entraining hypothalamic clock gene expression to a 24 h rhythm, it shifted the phase of Bmal-1 promoter activity, indicating that IGF-1 functions as a zeitgeber for cellular hypothalamic circadian clocks. Our results reveal that IGF-1 regulates clock gene expression and that GSK-3β but not ERK-1/2 is required for the IGF-1-mediated regulation of the Bmal-1 promoter in hypothalamic cells.'\n",

Compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory and pain killing action due to dexamethasone like phytosterol property. Promising anti-denaturation and anti-proteinase activity offered by the compound 5, may hold its promise to fight against arthritis by rejuvenating the osteoblast cells and destroying the bone-resorpting complex of hydrated protein, bone minerals by secreting the acid and an enzyme collagenase along with pain management. The lead bioactive compound i.e. β-sitosterol glucoside (compound 5) demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory activity showing more than 90% protection against the inflammatory cytokines at 50\\u202fµM dose. The anti-denaturation and COX-2 inhibition shown by the compound 5 was also noteworthy with the significant IC (ranging from 0.25 to 2.56\\u202fµM) that also supporting its future promise for developing as anti-inflammatory agent. Since the most bio-active compound (5) elicit promising acute anti-inflammatory action and peripheral anti-nociceptive pain killing action with a significant ED dose of 3.95 & 2.84\\u202fmg/kg i.p. respectively in the in-vivo animal model. It could suggest its potentiality as a good in-vivo bio available agent to be an emerging anti-inflammatory drug regimen scaffold in the future. It also establishes significant in-vitro and in-vivo result co-relation. Therefore, the compound 5 could be believed as a potent lead for designing anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic drug or pain killer without showing any untoward effect.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Duality of iron as an essential cofactor of many enzymatic metabolic processes and as a catalyst of poorly controlled redox-cycling reactions defines its possible biological beneficial and hazardous role in the body. In this review, we discuss these two \"faces\" of iron in a newly conceptualized program of regulated cell death, ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a genetically programmed iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by enhanced lipid peroxidation and insufficient capacity of thiol-dependent mechanisms (glutathione peroxidase 4, GPX4) to eliminate hydroperoxy-lipids. We present arguments favoring the enzymatic mechanisms of ferroptotically engaged non-heme iron of 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOX) in complexes with phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (PEBP1) as a catalyst of highly selective and specific oxidation reactions of arachidonoyl- (AA) and adrenoyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). We discuss possible role of iron chaperons as control mechanisms for guided iron delivery directly to their \"protein clients\" thus limiting non-enzymatic redox-cycling reactions. We also consider opportunities of loosely-bound iron to contribute to the production of pro-ferroptotic lipid oxidation products. Finally, we propose a two-stage iron-dependent mechanism for iron in ferroptosis by combining its catalytic role in the 15-LOX-driven production of 15-hydroperoxy-AA-PE (HOO-AA-PE) as well as possible involvement of loosely-bound iron in oxidative cleavage of HOO-AA-PE to oxidatively truncated electrophiles capable of attacking nucleophilic targets in yet to be identified proteins leading to cell demise.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Histone lysine methylation influences processes such as gene expression and DNA repair. Thirty Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins have been identified and phylogenetically clustered into seven subfamilies. Most JmjC domain-containing proteins have been shown to possess histone demethylase activity toward specific histone methylation marks. One of these subfamilies, the KDM5 family, is characterized by five conserved domains and includes four members. Interestingly, de novo loss-of-function and missense variants in KDM5B were identified in patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but also in unaffected individuals. Here, we report two novel de novo splice variants in the KDM5B gene in three patients with ID and ASD. The c.808\\u202f+\\u202f1G\\u202f>\\u202fA variant was identified in a boy with mild ID and autism traits and is associated with a significant reduced KDM5B mRNA expression without alteration of its H3K4me3 pattern. In contrast, the c.576\\u202f+\\u202f2T\\u202f>\\u202fC variant was found in twins with global delay in developmental milestones, poor language and ASD. This variant causes the production of an abnormal transcript which may produce an altered protein with the loss of the ARID1B domain with an increase in global gene H3K4me3. Our data reinforces the recent observation that the KDM5B haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism involved in intellectual disability and that KDM5B disorder associated with LOF variants is a recessive disorder. However, some variants may also cause gain of function, and need to be interpreted with caution, and functional studies should be performed to identify the molecular consequences of these different rare variants.'\n"

Among these, PGAP3 mutations are associated with HPMRS type 4. We report two siblings with a novel homozygous variant in PGAP3 expanding both the phenotypic findings and the mutational spectrum of HPMRS type 4. Developmental delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphism were the consistent findings with HPMRS in our patients. Large anterior fontanel size, gum hypertrophy, pes equinovarus, concentric ventricle hypertrophy, frontoparietal atrophy and dysphagia were the findings of our patients that have been reported for the first time in this syndrome. Although there is an extensive list of differential diagnoses in patients with developmental delay and hypotonia, the recognizable pattern of facial features, parental consanguinity and mild to moderate serum ALP elevation should be sufficiently suggestive of HPMRS type 4.'\n",

Recently a HAND1 mutation has been reported to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the association of a HAND2 mutation with DCM is still to be ascertained. In this research, the coding regions and splicing junction sites of the HAND2 gene were sequenced in 206 unrelated patients affected with idiopathic DCM, and a new heterozygous HAND2 mutation, NM_021973.2: c.199G\\xa0>\\xa0T; p.(Glu67*), was discovered in an index patient with DCM. The nonsense mutation was absent in 300 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy persons. Genetic scan of the mutation carrier's family members revealed that the genetic mutation co-segregated with DCM, which was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, with complete penetrance. Functional deciphers unveiled that the mutant HAND2 protein had no transcriptional activity. In addition, the mutation abrogated the synergistic transcriptional activation between HAND2 and GATA4 or between HAND2 and NKX2.5, two other cardiac transcription factors that have been implicated in DCM. These research findings firstly suggest HAND2 as a novel gene predisposing to DCM in humans, which adds novel insight to the molecular pathogenesis of DCM, implying potential implications in the design of personized preventive and therapeutic strategies against DCM.\"\n",

We performed whole-genome sequence analyses of patients with Hirschsprung disease to identify genetic factors that contribute to disease development and analyzed the functional effects of these variants.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed whole-genome sequence analyses of 443 patients with short-segment disease, recruited from hospitals in China and Vietnam, and 493 ethnically matched individuals without Hirschsprung disease (controls). We performed genome-wide association analyses and gene-based rare variant burden tests to identify rare and common disease-associated variants and study their interactions. We obtained induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 4 patients with Hirschsprung disease and 2 controls, and used these to generate enteric neural crest cells for transcriptomic analyses. We assessed the neuronal lineage differentiation capability of iPSC-derived enteric neural crest cells using an in vitro differentiation assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: We identified 4 susceptibility loci, including 1 in the phospholipase D1 gene (PLD1; P=7.4x10). The patients had a significant excess of rare protein-altering variants in genes previously associated with Hirschsprung disease, and in the beta-secretase 2 gene (BACE2; P=2.9x10). The epistatic effects of common and rare variants across these loci provided a sensitized background that increased risk for the disease. In studies of the iPSCs, we observed common and distinct pathways associated with variants in RET that affect risk. In functional assays, we found variants in BACE2 to protect enteric neurons from apoptosis. We propose that alterations in BACE1 signaling via APP and BACE2 contribute to pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In whole-genome sequence analyses of patients with Hirschsprung disease, we identified rare and common variants associated with disease risk.

      "Abstract :'Sevoflurane is an experimental potent yet volatile anesthesia agent characterized by a low blood/gas partition coefficient. However, exposure to sevoflurane in neonatal mice has been speculated to result in learning deficits and abnormal social behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between sevoflurane and miR-96, in an attempt to identify the means by which it mediates IGF1R to influence the cognitive dysfunction (CD) in neonatal rats. Relationship between differentially expressed miRNAs and sevoflurane concentration was identified. The potential underlying regulatory mechanisms involved with sevoflurane were investigated through the administration of varying concentrations of the agent (1%, 2% and 4%), combined with miR-96 mimic or an inhibitor. A target prediction program was utilized, while the luciferase activity was determined in order to verify whether miR-96 targets IGF1R. The mRNA and protein levels of IGF1R, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were measured followed by the determination of hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Learning and memory performance was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test and step-down test. The obtained results highlighted a positive correlation between miR-96 and the concentration of sevoflurane, while miR-96 was confirmed to negatively target IGF1R. Our analyses indicated that 4% sevoflurane had a significantly stronger effect on reducing the levels of IGF1R and Bcl-2, while elevating the levels of miR-96, Bax and caspase-3 more so than that of 1% or 2% sevoflurane, which resulted in increased hippocampal neuron apoptosis but diminished the learning and memory performance of the rats. The addition of miR-96 mimic was demonstrated to exacerbate the influence of sevoflurane on hippocampal neurons as well as the cognitive function of the rats. The key findings of our study highlighted the role of miR-96 in the potential mechanism of sevoﬂurane anesthesia-induced CD in neonatal rats through the downregulation of IGF1R.'\n",

In addition, soluble factors excreted by MSCs, including several cytokines and exosomes, enhanced cardiomyocyte-specific marker production, produced more energy under normal and stressed conditions, and reduced reactive oxygen species production by iPSC-CMs under stressed condition. Notably, gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that microRNAs and proteins in the exosomes impacted the functionality and maturation of iPSC-CMs. Furthermore, cell sheets consisting of a mixture of iPSC-CMs and MSCs showed longer survival and enhanced therapeutic effects compared with those consisting of iPSC-CMs alone.

GPB is a pre-prodrug, hydrolyzed by lipases to phenylbutyric acid (PBA) that upon absorption is beta-oxidized to the active nitrogen scavenger phenylacetic acid (PAA), which is conjugated to glutamine (PAGN) and excreted as urinary PAGN (UPAGN). Pharmacokinetics (PK) of GPB were examined to see if hydrolysis is impaired in very young patients who may lack lipase activity.\\n\\nMETHODS: Patients 2\\u202fmonths to <2\\u202fyears of age with UCDs from two open label studies (n\\u202f=\\u202f17, median age 10\\u202fmonths) predominantly on stable doses of nitrogen scavengers (n\\u202f=\\u202f14) were switched to GPB. Primary assessments included traditional plasma PK analyses of PBA, PAA, and PAGN, using noncompartmental methods with WinNonlin™. UPAGN was collected periodically throughout the study up to 12\\u202fmonths.\\n\\nRESULTS: PBA, PAA and PAGN rapidly appeared in plasma after GPB dosing, demonstrating evidence of GPB cleavage with subsequent PBA absorption. Median concentrations of PBA, PAA and PAGN did not increase over time and were similar to or lower than the values observed in older UCD patients. The median PAA/PAGN ratio was well below one over time, demonstrating that conjugation of PAA with glutamine to form PAGN did not reach saturation. Covariate analyses indicated that age did not influence the PK parameters, with body surface area (BSA) being the most significant covariate, reinforcing current BSA based dosing recommendations as seen in older patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: These observations demonstrate that UCD patients aged 2\\u202fmonths to <2\\u202fyears have sufficient lipase activity to adequately convert the pre-prodrug GPB to PBA. PBA is then converted to its active moiety (PAA) providing successful nitrogen scavenging even in very young children.'\n",

One of the contributing factors for the high mortality rate seen of pancreatic cancer patients is the lack of effective chemotherapies, which is believed to be due to drug-resistance. Based on recent evidence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ETM) of pancreatic cancer cells has been found to be associated with the development of drug resistance and an increase in cell invasion. Therefore, we conducted the present study in order to investigate the regulatory effects of Golgi protein-73 (GP73) on PC. GP73 and EMT-related gene expressions in PC, along with the adjacent and chronic pancreatitis tissues were determined by means of RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Cultured PC cells were treated with pAdTrack-CMV, si-NC, GP73 overexpression, Si-GP73, Snail-siRNA and GP73\\xa0+\\xa0Snail-siRNA. Cell invasion, migration and metastasis were measured in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. The results revealed that the PC tissues and chronic pancreatitis tissues exhibited diminished E-cadherin expression and amplified GP73, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail expression. In response to GP73 gene silencing, PC cells presented with increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail expression in addition to the inhibition of the number of invasive cells, tumor volume and number of liver lesions. These findings highly indicated that the overexpression of GP73 promotes cell invasion, migration and metastasis by inducing EMT in PC.'\n",

Polyphasic approach and whole genome sequencing were used to determine the taxonomy status and genomic profiles of the novel strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two isolates were closely related to Thermus scotoductus SE-1 (97.1% sequence similarity), and T. amyloliquefaciens YIM 77409 (96.6%). The strains could be differentiated from most recognized Thermus species by their whitish to slight reddish colony color, distinct DNA fingerprinting profiles and low ANI values. Cells stained Gram-negative, rod-shaped of diameter 0.2-0.5μm and length 1.5-5.0μm. Growth occurred at 50-75°C, pH 6.0-9.0 and in the presence of up to 1.0% (w/v) NaCl concentration. Thiosulfate was found to enhance cell growth, besides improving the intensity of its colony color. Oxygen, nitrate, sulfur, and Fe(III) could be used as terminal electron acceptors for growth. MK-8 was the major respiratory menaquinone. Major fatty acids were iso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and anteiso-C. The genome size was 2.26Mbp with 65.5% average GC content. A total of 2374 genes was predicted, comprising 2322 protein-coding and 52 RNA genes.

All experiments were performed with Hep G2 cells, a well-known and described human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. By using xCELLigence system, we demonstrated that mifepristone enhances toxicity of etoposide in a dose dependent manner with concomitant caspase-3 activity. We evaluated upregulation of Bax because mifepristone was demonstrated to modulate proapoptotic Bax protein expression. Our data show only weak and not statistically significant increase of Bax expression. On the other hand, we show that mifepristone increases etoposide toxicity via inhibition of ABC transporters, coupled with significant increase of intracellular etoposide concentration.

      "Abstract :'Global eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will require an efficacious vaccine capable of eliciting protective immunity against genetically diverse HCV strains. Natural spontaneous resolution of HCV infection is associated with production of broadly-neutralizing antibodies targeting the HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2. As such, production of cross-neutralizing antibodies is an important endpoint for experimental vaccine trials. Varying success generating cross-neutralizing antibodies has been achieved with immunogens derived from naturally-occurring HCV strains. In this study the challenge of minimising the genetic diversity between the vaccine strain and circulating HCV isolates was addressed. Two novel synthetic E2 glycoprotein immunogens (NotC1 and NotC2) were derived from consensus nucleotide sequences deduced from samples of circulating genotype 1 HCV strains. These two synthetic sequences differed in their relative positions in the overall genotype 1a/1b phylogeny. Expression of these constructs in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells resulted in high yields of correctly-folded, monomeric E2 protein, which were recognised by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of guinea pigs with either of these consensus immunogens, or a comparable protein representing a circulating genotype 1a strain resulted in high titres of cross-reactive anti-E2 antibodies. All immunogens generated antibodies capable of neutralizing the H77 strain, but NotC1 elicited antibodies that more potently neutralized virus entry. These vaccine-induced antibodies neutralized some viruses representing genotype 1, but not strains representing genotype 2 or genotype 3. Thus, while this approach to vaccine design resulted in correctly folded, immunogenic protein, cross-neutralizing epitopes were not preferentially targeted by the host immune response generated by this immunogen. Greater immunofocussing by vaccines to common epitopes is necessary to successfully elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.'\n",

Some of these changes persist for over a week after mating because the seminal protein that causes these changes, the Sex Peptide (SP), binds to sperm that are stored in the female reproductive tract. SP's sperm binding is mediated by a network of at least eight seminal proteins. We show here that some of these network proteins (CG1656, CG1652, CG9997 and Antares) bind to sperm within 2\\u202fh of mating, like SP. However, while SP remains bound to sperm at 4 days post-mating, none of the other network proteins are detectable at this time. We also observed that the same network proteins are detectable at 2\\u202fh post-mating in seminal receptacle tissue from which sperm have been removed, but are no longer detectable there by 4 days post-mating, suggesting short-term retention of these proteins in this female sperm storage organ.

Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are compound polymers that have recently been highlighted for their sharp and reversible phase transition property when heated above their lower critical solution temperature (LCST). ELPs preserve this behavior when fused to a protein, and as a result providing a simple method to isolate a recombinant ELP fusion protein from cell contaminants by taking the solution through the soluble and insoluble phase of the ELP fusion protein, a technique designated as the inverse transition cycle (ITC). ITC is considered an inexpensive and efficient way of purifying recombinant ELP fusion proteins. In addition, ELPs render recombinant fusion protein more stability and a longer clear time in blood stream, which give ELPs a lot of valuable applications in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industry. This article reviews the modernizations of ELPs and briefly highlights on the possible use of technologies such as the automatic piston discharge (APD) centrifuges to improve the efficiency of the ITC in the pharmaceutical industry to obtain benefits.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Strategic design and suitable purification techniques are of paramount importance in the production of recombinant proteins, if intended for use in a diagnostic assay. However, there is no single protocol that can be universally adopted for obtaining proteins in requisite quality and quantity across various platforms. In this study, we have targeted proteins of bluetongue virus (BTV), which is the causative agent of an arthropod-borne infectious disease in ruminants. Traditionally, serological diagnosis of the disease has rested upon either virus neutralization test or on an ELISA test that employed a recombinant structural (VP1, VP7) protein. Among the non-structural (NS) proteins of BTV, NS1 and NS3, are preferred candidate antigens in development of immuno-diagnostics as these provide the option for identifying recent/ongoing infection. However, the difficulty in production/purification of recombinant full length NS proteins of BTV in sufficient quantity and quality in various expression systems, due to inherent structural complexities, have restricted their wider applicability as immunodiagnostic reagents. To circumvent the difficulties associated with production/purification, we developed a novel NS1 and NS3 fusion gene (∼1302 bp) encoding for NS1 N-terminus (M to G aa) and NS3 protein containing the N- and C-termini with a deletion of two hydrophobic domains along with intervening variable central domain (A to A aa) of bluetongue virus 23. This construct was cloned, over-expressed and efficiently purified by single step affinity chromatography under unique denaturing/renaturing condition. The purified fusion protein was found suitable for detection of antibodies against BTV in an indirect ELISA (iELISA).'\n"

      "Abstract :'The mechanisms driving innovations that distinguish large taxons are poorly known and essentially accessible via a candidate gene approach. A spectacular acquisition by tunicate larvaceans is the house, a complex extracellular filtration device. Its components are secreted by the oikoplastic epithelium which covers the animal trunk. Here we describe the development of this epithelium in larvae through the formation of specific cellular territories known to produce distinct sets of house proteins (Oikosins). It involves cell divisions and morphological differentiation but very limited cell migration. A diverse set of homeobox genes, most often duplicated in the genome, are transiently and site-specifically expressed in the trunk epithelium at early larval stages. Using RNA interference, we show that two prop duplicates are involved in the differentiation of a region on and around the dorsal midline, regulating morphology and the production of a specific oikosin. Our observations favor a scenario in which multiple homeobox genes and most likely other developmental transcription factors were recruited for this innovation. Their frequent duplications probably predated, but were not required for the emergence of the house.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Hundreds of thousands of cis-regulatory DNA sequences are predicted in vertebrate genomes, but unlike genes themselves, few have been characterized at the functional level or even unambiguously paired with a target gene. Here we serendipitously identified and started investigating the first reported long-range regulatory region for the Nr2f1 (Coup-TFI) transcription factor gene. NR2F1 is temporally and spatially regulated during development and required for patterning and regionalization in the nervous system, including sensory hair cell organization in the auditory epithelium of the cochlea. Analyzing the deaf wanderer (dwnd) spontaneous mouse mutation, we traced back the cause of its associated circling behavior to a 53\\u202fkb deletion removing five exons and adjacent intronic regions of the poorly characterized Mctp1 gene. Interestingly, loss of Mctp1 function cannot account for the hearing loss, inner ear dysmorphology and sensory hair cell disorganization observed in dwnd mutants. Instead, we found that the Mctp1 deletion affects the Nr2f1 gene located 1.4\\u202fMb away, downregulating transcription and protein expression in the embryonic cochlea. Remarkably, the Mctp1 allele failed to complement a targeted inactivation allele of Nr2f1, and transheterozygotes or Mctp1 homozygotes exhibit the same morphological defects observed in inner ears of Nr2f1 mutants without sharing their early life lethality. Defects include improper separation of the utricle and saccule in the vestibule not described previously, which can explain the circling behavior that first brought the spontaneous mutation to attention. By contrast, mice homozygous for a targeted inactivation of Mctp1 have normal hearing and inner ear structures. We conclude that the 53\\u202fkb Mctp1 deletion encompasses a long-range cis-regulatory region essential for proper Nr2f1 expression in the embryonic inner ear, providing a first opportunity to investigate Nr2f1 function in postnatal inner ears. This work adds to the short list of long-range regulatory regions characterized as essential to drive expression of key developmental control genes.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Bivalve shells are inorganic-organic nanocomposites whose material properties outperform their purely inorganic mineral counterparts. Most typically the inorganic phase is a polymorph of CaCO, while the organic phase contains biopolymers which have been presumed to be chitin and/or proteins. Identifying the biopolymer phase is therefore a crucial step in improving our understanding of design principles relevant to biominerals. In this work we study seven shells; four are examples of nacroprismatic shells (Alathyria jacksoni, Pinctada maxima, Hyriopsis cumingii and Cucumerunio novaehollandiae), one homogeneous (Arctica islandica), and two are crossed lamellar (Callista kingii, Tridacna gigas). Both intact shells, their organic extracts as isolated after decalcification in acid, and the periostracum overlay have been studied by solid-state CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, SEM and chemical analysis. In none of the shells examined in this work do we find a significant contribution to the organic fraction from chitin or its derivatives despite popular models of bivalve biomineralization which assume abundant chitin in the organic fraction of mollusk bivalve shells. In each of the nacroprismatic extracts the C NMR spectra represent similar proteinaceous material, Ala and Gly-rich and primarily organized as β-sheets. A different, yet highly conserved protein was found in the periostracum covering each of the three nacreous shells studied. The Arctica islandica shells with homogeneous microstructure contained proteins which do not appear to be silk-like, while in the crossed lamellar shells we extracted too little organic matter to characterize.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrophobic macromolecules are structural components within the calcareous inorganic matrix of bivalve shells and are responsible for enhanced materials properties of the biominerals. Prevalent models suggest that chitin is such major hydrophobic component. Contrary to that we show that chitin is rare within the hydrophobic biopolymers which primarily consist of proteinaceous matter with structural motifs as silk-like β-sheets, or others yet to be determined. Recognizing that diverse proteinaceous motifs, devoid of abundant chitin, can yield the optimized mechanical properties of bivalve shells is critical both to understand the mechanistic pathways by which they regulate biomineralization and for the design of novel bioinspired materials.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The expression and activity of human placental transporters during pregnancy could be altered by several factors including pathological changes associated with preeclampsia. The aims of this study were to identify the placental efflux transporters involved in the bio-disposition of pravastatin, determine the protein expression of these transporters and their encoding genes as well as the activity of pravastatin uptake in placentas obtained from patients with preeclampsia. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin by trophoblast tissue apical and basal membrane vesicles exhibited sigmoidal kinetics. The curved shapes of Eadie-Hofstee plots indicate that more than one placental transporter are involved in the uptake of pravastatin. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin into vesicles expressing MRP1-5, BCRP, and P-gp, as well as the results of inhibition studies suggest that BCRP and MRP1 are the major placental efflux transporters responsible for the in vitro uptake of pravastatin. Compared to placentas from healthy pregnancies, preeclamptic placentas had increased number of syncytial knots with increased expression of BCRP in their apical membrane and increased expression of MRP1 in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast and in cytoplasm of syncytial knots. There was a concomitant increase in ABCC1 but not in ABCG2 gene expressions in preeclamptic placentas. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin by vesicles prepared from apical membranes of preeclamptic placentas was similar to the uptake by vesicles prepared from placentas obtained after uncomplicated pregnancies (13.9\\u202f±\\u202f6.5 vs 14.1\\u202f±\\u202f5.8\\u202fpmol·mg\\u202fprotein\\u202fmin).

The mechanisms of resistance to these treatments are complex, including specific mutations or alternative splicing of oncogenic proteins. An alternative approach to treating CRPC may be to target the turnover of these molecular drivers of CRPC.

      "Abstract :'Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an important transcription factor that is expressed in a variety of tissues and regulates many critical physiologic and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, stem cell reprogramming, maintenance of genomic stability, and normal tissue homeostasis. KLF4 has both tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions in gastrointestinal and other cancers. These functions are thought to be context dependent, but how KLF4 exerts these differential functions and the molecular mechanisms behind them remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the KLF4 gene undergoes alternative splicing, and the protein products of certain transcripts antagonize wild-type KLF4 function, suggesting an additional layer of regulation of KLF4 function. Therefore, detailed study of KLF4 alternative splicing may not only provide new insights into the complexity of KLF4 functions but also lead to rational targeting of KLF4 for cancer prevention and therapy.'\n",

Lnc-RAB1A-2, a Ras-related protein Rab-1A (RAB1A) upstream lncRNA, was chosen for assessment of its impact on lung cancer prognosis in a case-based analysis and investigation of its biological function though a series of functional assays. Lnc-RAB1A-2 was significantly upregulated in 276 lung cancer tissues compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues, and its expression level was significantly correlated with clinical stage and metastasis status in lung cancer patients. Patients with high expression levels of this lncRNA had a shorter median survival time (16.0 months vs. 23.0 months, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.011 in southern samples; 8.0 months vs. 19.0 months, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.020 in eastern samples; 13.0 months vs. 19.0 months, P\\u202f=\\u202f0.002 in merged samples) and a higher risk of death than those with lower levels (HR\\u202f=\\u202f1.52; 95% CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.01-2.26, in merged samples). Additionally, overexpression of lnc-RAB1A-2 significantly promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses using digital gene expression tag profiling revealed that lnc-RAB1A-2 could affect the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), a gene involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that is largely activated by RAB1A. FGF1 was confirmed to be a down-stream gene of lnc-RAB1A-2. Collectively, our study demonstrated that lnc-RAB1A-2 is associated with poor lung cancer prognosis by promoting lung cancer development.'\n",

However, it is unknown how CD133 and TM4SF5 cross-talk with each other for cancer stem cell properties. Here, we investigated the significance of inter-relationships between CD133, TM4SF5, CD44, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) in a three-dimensional (3D) sphere growth system. We found that CD133 upregulated TM4SF5 and CD44, whereas TM4SF5 and CD44 did not affect CD133 expression. Signaling activity following CD133 phosphorylation caused TM4SF5 expression and sphere growth. TM4SF5 bound to CD133 and promoted c-Src activity for CD133 phosphorylation as a positive feedback loop, leading to CD133-mediated sphere growth that was inhibited by TM4SF5 inhibition or suppression. TM4SF5 also bound PTPRF and promoted paxillin phosphorylation. Decreased sphere growth upon CD133 suppression was recovered by TM4SF5 expression and partially by PTPRF suppression. TM4SF5 inhibition enhanced PTPRF levels and abolished PTPRF suppression-mediated sphere growth. Altogether, CD133-induced TM4SF5 expression and function were important for liver cancer sphere growth and may be a promising target to block metastasis.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Maintenance of epigenetic integrity relies on coordinated recycling and partitioning of parental histones and deposition of newly synthesized histones during DNA replication. This process depends upon a poorly characterized network of histone chaperones, remodelers, and binding proteins. Here we implicate the POLE3-POLE4 subcomplex of the leading-strand polymerase, Polε, in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly through its ability to selectively bind to histones H3-H4. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and physical mapping, we define minimal domains necessary for interaction\\xa0between POLE3-POLE4 and histones H3-H4. Biochemical analyses establish that POLE3-POLE4 is a histone chaperone that promotes tetrasome formation and DNA supercoiling in\\xa0vitro. In cells, POLE3-POLE4 binds both newly synthesized and parental histones, and its depletion hinders helicase unwinding and chromatin PCNA unloading and compromises coordinated parental histone retention and new histone deposition. Collectively, our study reveals that POLE3-POLE4 possesses intrinsic H3-H4 chaperone activity, which facilitates faithful nucleosome dynamics at the replication fork.'\n",

We examined how different indicators of NA and PA predicted concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and seven peripheral inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ) that were examined in the form of an inflammatory composite. A community-based sample of 220 adults (62% Black/African-American and 25% Hispanic/Latino; aged 25-65; 65% female) completed questionnaires at baseline (including recalled affect \"over the past month\") and then provided EMA reports 5x/day for 14\\u202fdays. Blood was drawn from each participant after completion of EMA and used to determine plasma levels of CRP and cytokines. Analyses examined if indicators of affect predicted inflammation, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, education, health conditions, and statin use. Neither recalled NA or PA nor momentary NA or PA (aggregated across the 14\\u202fdays of EMA) were significantly associated with the cytokine composite or CRP. Negative mood more proximal to the blood draw (i.e., aggregated momentary NA in week 2 of EMA) was associated with the cytokine composite but not CRP. Exploratory moderation analyses revealed that the cytokine composite was also associated with PA in week 2 for men only, and with recalled NA for those with lower education. Exploratory analyses around temporal dynamics suggested that the timing of NA measurement relative to the blood draw mattered: Specifically, there were stronger trends of association between momentary NA and inflammatory cytokines when NA was assessed closer in time to blood collection. Future investigation of the relevance of temporal proximity and other measurement details may improve understanding of how affect relates to inflammation.'\n",

Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5-31\\u202fweeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.'\n"

This injurious disease spread by the circulation of the blood sucking triatomine insects and transmitted to humans. Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and also known as American trypanosomasis. Currently, 7 million people are infected by T. cruzi infection and about 22,000 death cases were reported per year throughout the Americas. Various immunization approaches against T. cruzi infection have been examined and some of the developed vaccine showed efficacy in animal models but there is no effective and safe vaccines for humans have been developed yet. Since, the drug resistance is increasing day by day because the developed drug (nifurtimox and benznidazole) to control T. cruzi infection, failed to activate a prodrug and still no drug and vaccine have been established. To control the infection of chagas disease, here in this study we use immunoinformatics method to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine against T. cruzi infection. Moreover, on the basis of immunogenicity B and T cell epitopes were evaluated. The allergenicity, antigenicity was predicted to ensure the safety of vaccine constructs whereas, the physiochemical property showing the stable nature of final vaccine model.

By dissipating the electrochemical H gradient, UCP1 uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis, which drives an increase in substrate oxidation via the TCA cycle flux that generates more heat. The mitochondrial uncoupling-mediated non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is vital primarily to mammals, such as rodents and new-born humans, but more recently additional functions in adult humans have been described. UCP1 is regulated by β-adrenergic receptors through the sympathetic nervous system and at the molecular activity level by nucleotides and fatty acid to meet thermogenesis needs. The discovery of novel UCP homologs has greatly contributed to the understanding of human diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. In this article, we review the progress made towards the molecular mechanism and function of the UCPs, in particular focusing on the influential contributions from Martin Klingenberg's laboratory.

The results showed that Bcl2L12 was expressed by peripheral CD4 T cells that was associated with Th2 polarization in UC patients. Bcl2L12 mediated the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2)-induced IL-4 expression in CD4 cells. Activation of PAR2 increased expression of Bcl2L12 in CD4 T cells. Bcl2L12 mRNA decayed spontaneously in CD4 T cells after separated from UC patients which was prevented by activating PAR2. Bcl2L12 mediated the binding between GATA3 and the Il4 promoter in CD4 T cells. Mice with Bcl2L12 deficiency failed to induce Th2-biased inflammation in the colon mucosa.

The recombinant strains pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 and pPG-612-VP2/L. casei 393 were orally administrated to juvenile rainbow trouts, and significant titers of IgM and IgT of pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 were observed. The results demonstrate that the recombinants could elicit both local mucosal and systemic immune responses. The proliferation of spleen lymphocytes in trouts immunized with pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 showed that the recombinant strain could induce a strong cellular immune response. The IL-1β, IL-8, CK6, MHC-II, Mx, β-defensin, and TNF-1α levels in the spleen and gut suggest that the target molecular chemokine has the ability to attract relevant immune cells to participate in the inflammatory response and enhance the function of the innate immune response. Additionally, the pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 induced the expression of cytokines, which have the effect of promoting inflammation to drive the differentiation of macrophages and clear target cells. After challenging with IPNV, the reduction in viral load caused by pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 was significantly higher than that of the other groups.

      "Abstract :'The cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a peptide commonly studied in the feeding behavior, but it exerts an important role in the autonomic and cardiovascular control as well. It is known that exogenous administration of CART in the central nervous system can elicit increase in blood pressure of both conscious and anesthetized rodents, but little is known whether these central effects might differ between lean and obese animals. We have recently shown that diet-induced obese mice that developed hypertension presented an upregulation of CART levels in the dorsomedial nucleus of hypothalamus, while obese normotensive ones had not. Herein we investigate whether the central action of CART could activate differently the hypothalamic nuclei of diet-induced obese mice compared to the lean counterparts by using Fos protein expression, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to two cohorts, one fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks (obese), and the other fed with regular rodent chow (lean). Both groups received an ICV injection of CART at the dose of 400μM, 1\\u2009mM or vehicle. Subsequently, the brains were processed for Fos protein immunohistochemical in order to identify hypothalamic neuronal activation. Significantly greater numbers of Fos-positive neurons were observed in the PVN and DMH of obese mice that received CART 1\\u2009mM, when compared to the lean control. These results indicate that the central action of CART induces neuronal activation in the hypothalamic nuclei of obese and lean mice, and this could be relevant to the different autonomic and cardiovascular adjustments that an organism exposed to different diet and metabolic condition.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Angiogenesis is fundamental for solid tumor growth and metastasis, and anti-angiogenic therapy has been an important therapeutic option for cancer treatment. Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The current studies were aimed at investigating the anti-angiogenic effects of the natural compound 4'-hydroxywogonin (4'-HW) on CRC-related angiogenesis. Human CRC cell line SW620\\u202fcells and normal human intestinal epithelial HIEC cells were cultured and treated with interleukin-6 to mimic the tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Our data showed that 4'-HW reduced the viability of SW620\\u202fcells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 4'-HW also suppressed the proliferation of SW620\\u202fcells, but had little effect on the viability of HIEC cells. Moreover, 4'-HW concentration-dependently decreased the mRNA and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the predominant pro-angiogenic cytokine in tumor angiogenesis. Subsequently, 4'-HW concentration-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, similar to 4'-HW, significantly downregulated the VEGF-A expression in SW620\\u202fcells, and combination of wortmannin and 4'-HW produced more significant effects. Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with the conditioned medium of 4'-HW-treated SW620\\u202fcells exhibited impaired angiogenic capacity at Matrigel. Incubation with the neutralizing antibody against VEGF-Aalone also suppressed the angiogenic properties of HUVECs in vitro. Collectively, 4'-HW decreased the viability and reduced angiogenesis in CRC, which was associated with downregulation of VEGF-A expression by disrupting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our discoveries suggested 4'-HW as a promising anticancer agent against CRC targeting angiogenesis.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"INTRODUCTION: On stimulation by lipoteichoic acid or by a physical injury, fibroblasts have been shown to play a major role in the initiation of the pulp inflammatory reaction and healing through secretion of complement proteins and growth factors. The application of direct pulp-capping materials on these cells may interfere with the inflammatory and the healing processes within the pulp's inextensible environment. This work was designed to study in\\xa0vitro the effects of silicate-based materials on pulp fibroblast modulation of the initial steps of pulp inflammation and healing.\\n\\nMETHODS: The effects of Biodentine, TheraCal, and Xeno III eluates were studied on lipoteichoic acid-stimulated and physically injured fibroblasts. Cytokine secretion (interleukin 6, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and transforming growth factor-β1) was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inflammatory THP-1 adhesion to endothelial cells and their migration and activation were studied in\\xa0vitro. Human pulp fibroblast proliferation was investigated with the MTT test, and their migration to the injury site was studied with the scratch healing assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: Interleukin 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion increased with all materials but to a lesser extent with Biodentine. Fibroblast growth factor-2 and transforming growth factor-β1 secretion was significantly higher with Biodentine than with all other materials. THP-1 cell adhesion to endothelial cells and their activation were reduced by Biodentine and TheraCal. However, their migration decreased only with Biodentine. Fibroblast proliferation significantly increased with Biodentine but significantly decreased with Xeno III after day 6. Finally, only Biodentine induced fibroblast migration to the injury site in the scratch assay.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that pulp-capping materials affect the early steps of pulp inflammation and healing. They show that Biodentine had the highest pulp healing and anti-inflammatory potential when compared with the resin-containing materials. This highlights the interest of the material choice for direct pulp-capping.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"Amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ) could induce cognitive deficits through oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuron death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAPK pathways have been thought to mediate Aβ-induced neuroinflammation responses, neuron death and cognitive decline in AD. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) exerts a neuroprotective effect. However, whether α7nAChR alleviates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through MAPKs (p38, ERK, JNK) in vivo remains unclear. In our study, memory was assessed in C57BL/6 mice using a Y-maze test. Cell death was assessed by Nissl and Hoechst staining and Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, and Cytochrome C levels using Western blotting. Oxidative stress was assayed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Inflammation was examined with GFAP and Iba1 using immunohistochemistry. The Aβ degrading enzymes insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP) were tested using Western blotting. We found that activating α7nAChR or inhibiting p38 or JNK pathway alleviated Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and neuron loss and death by reducing oxidative stress. In addition, activating α7nAChR or inhibiting p38 or JNK pathway also reduced inflammation, which was observed as reduced GFAP and Iba1 levels with different effects on Aβ degrading enzymes. Finally, we found that the activation of α7nAChR led to the downregulation of pp38 and pJNK levels. Conversely, the inhibition of p38 or JNK resulted in the upregulation of α7nAChR levels in the hippocampus and cortex. Our data indicate that the activation of α7nAChR alleviates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, and this protective effect might act through the downregulation of p38 and JNK MAPKs.\"\n"

Conjugation of these fragments with a mimic of CK2 substrate peptide resulted in bisubstrate inhibitors with increased affinity towards the kinase. Attachment of the fluorescent acceptor dye 5-TAMRA to the conjugates led to significant enhancement of intensity of long-lifetime (microsecond-scale) photoluminescence of both sulfur- and selenium-containing compounds.

Moreover, the insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in INDUS810-treated obese mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that INDUS810 could inhibit lipid accumulation at either differentiating or mature stages, and increase lipolysis activity in mature adipocytes. Additionally, INDUS810 has no effects on cell viability nor the expressions of adipocyte differentiation markers like fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α. In contrast, INDUS810 can increase protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1β, sirtuin 1 and sirtuin 3. Of note, INDUS810 can activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, which leads to the reduction of lipid contents in adipocytes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that INDUS810 is a potential anti-obesity agent, and this action depends on activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation.'\n",

Changes in the physiological activity of esophageal CSCs following treatment with different concentrations of Icaritin (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100\\u202fμmol/L) were evaluated. The CCK-8 method and Transwell assay were used to determine the effects of Icaritin on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of esophageal CSCs. Flow cytometery was used to investigate its effect on the apoptosis of CSCs. The effect of Icaritin on the expression of proteins in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways were determined using western blot test. Consequently, Icaritin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of esophageal CSCs in a dose-dependent manner. It promoted cell apoptosis, and influenced the levels of proteins in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways. It may act as a promising drug in the therapy of esophageal cancer.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Breast cancer is reported a very complex disease along with heterogeneous morphological characteristics and unrelated clinical behavior, and is a leading cancer among female. Nevertheless, chemo-resistance is frequently observed. Adriamycin (ADM) is a always employed drug to treat clinical breast cancer. However, strong resistance to ADM limited its clinical efficacy. Deregulation of HDAC6 activity is linked to various diseases including cancer resulting in accumulating interest for developing HDAC6 inhibitors. In the present study, for the first time, we found that 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), as histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor, could successfully reverse ADM resistance in human breast cancer cells. 4-HBA significantly promoted the anticancer effect of ADM on apoptosis induction, as evidenced by the increased expressions of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, which was associated with the promotion p53 and homeodomain interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) expressions in ADM-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of ADM on drug-resistant breast cancer cells was accelerated by 4-HBA through increasing the number of cells distributed in G2/M phase of cell cycle arrest. Inhibiting HIPK2/p53 pathway could abolish 4-HBA/ADM co-treatment-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Importantly, HDAC6 expressions were also significantly down-regulated in ADM-resistance breast cancer cells co-treated with ADM and 4-HBA. Additionally, 4-HBA clearly potentiated the anticancer role of ADM in the MCF-7 breast cancer animal model with low toxicity. Therefore, 4-HBA could be applied as an effective HDAC6 inhibitor to reverse human breast cancer resistance. Herein, the 4-HBA and ADM combination might represent as a useful therapeutic strategy to prevent human breast cancer.'\n",

Among other functions, these cells are responsible for the phagocytosis of rod and cone cell waste shed from the photoreceptor outer segments. We describe here studies to understand the involvement of the motor protein myosin VI in the trafficking of internalized microspheres by a human retinal pigment epithelium primary cell line (ARPE-19). We perturbed the myosin VI-actin interaction by overexpressing a dominant negative myosin VI construct in these cells. We used single particle tracking to characterize the trajectories of internalized fluorescent microspheres. Analysis of the speed of the microspheres' motions revealed that the magnitude of the average speed over short time scales is reduced in the presence of the dominant negative motor. Analysis of the mean-squared displacement of these trajectories demonstrated that trafficking of phagosomes involves two modes of motion, a rapid, more randomly directed motion that is myosin VI dependent and a slower, more directed motion that is independent of the motor. From these data, we posit that this trafficking process involves an interplay between myosin VI motors, which are involved in motion through the actin periphery of the cell, and microtubule motors.\"\n",

Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, containing a basic region-leucine zipper motif. JDP2 plays essential roles in various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, senescence and aging. In the study, we attempted to explore the effects of JDP2 on TBI progression both in\\xa0vivo and in\\xa0vitro. The wild type (WT) and JDP2 knockout (KO) mice were employed in our study and were subjected to TBI. The results showed that JDP2-deficient mice exhibited improved cognitive functions in TBI mice. The inflammatory cytokines, glial amount and apoptosis, as well as the protein of cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly increased after TBI in WT mice, and all these up-regulation were significantly mitigated by JDP2 knockout in mice. We also found that TBI induced JDP2 expression in hippocampus of mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated JDP2 expression levels in astrocytes isolated from WT mice, indicating the critical role of JDP2 in TBI. Suppressing Caspase-3 activation could reduce LPS-induced inflammation in astrocytes. Consistent with the results in\\xa0vivo, LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis were reversed by JDP2 deficiency in cells. Notably, we found that over-expressing JDP2 could further promoted inflammation, apoptosis and Caspase-3 activation induced by LPS. Collectively, JDP2 knockout effectively attenuate TBI in\\xa0vivo and in\\xa0vitro through blocking Caspase-3 activation, providing a potential therapeutic target for TBI or even other neurological disorders.'\n"

Increasing evidences have demonstrated that mircoRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the modulation of tumor growth and progression.

In our present study, we sought to explore biological role of miR-539 in HCC progression. qRT-PCR was utilized to evaluate the expression level of miR-539. Immunoblotting analysis, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays were used for the identification of the potential target of miR-539. Proliferation, migration and invasion assays and flow cytometric were performed to assess the biological functional role of miR-539. The molecular signaling pathways related to the integration of miR-539 were also evaluated. MiR-539 was reduced in human HCC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, also known as MAP2K1 was verified as the target of miR-539. Overexpression of miR-539 inhibited migration, invasion and cell proliferation, while apoptosis rate was increased. Knockdown or overexpression of MAP2K1 in HCC cell transfected with ag-miR-539 or in-miR-539 indicated that miR-539 suppresses the progression of HCC by directly targeting and regulating MAP2K1.

We observed an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation events in the presence of both ITK-FER and ITK-SYK. The downstream targets of ITK-FER and ITK-SYK were explored and STAT3 was found to be highly phosphorylated by these fusion kinases.

However, the function of ODC1 in immune cells and especially in macrophages, as well as its underlying molecular mechanism, remains unclear. This study revealed the potential ODC1 function and mechanism associated with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-, or carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced inflammatory response in macrophages. We found significant upregulation of ODC1 in macrophages following LPS simulation and ODC1-specific suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion from macrophages upon stimulation with LPS, BCG and CCl, respectively, suggesting a role as a common control element of the inflammatory response. Western blotting for nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases revealed significant inhibition of phosphorylation of multiple transcription factors following ODC1 overexpression in macrophages. Moreover, ODC1 inhibited reactive oxygen species-induced and caspase-dependent apoptosis highlighted by decreased caspase-3 and -9 expression following ODC1 upregulation. These findings indicated that ODC1 was involved in attenuating the inflammatory response upon stimulation of macrophages, making it a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.'\n",

The ISR plays an important role in protecting cells from tumor-related metabolic stresses, such as nutrient deprivation and perturbed proteostasis. Here, we showed that disruption of the ISR, together with increased cellular stress vulnerability, was produced by pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL, the oncogenic driver in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Treatment of CML-derived K562\\u202fcells with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib, prevented activation of eIF2α kinases, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and general control nonderepressible 2, and downstream ATF4 induction during metabolic stress. Prevention of ATF4 induction likely occurred as a result of the combinatorial suppression of the eIF2α kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PERK mimicked BCR-ABL inhibition to enhance apoptosis induction under stress conditions.

In this study, we examined the expression profile of neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), calcyclin (S100A6), vimentin and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal enteric neurons and enteric glia cells (EGCs) during prenatal development using an immunohistochemical method. The material of the study consisted of 15 different fetal ileum tissues obtained between days 60 and 150 of pregnancy. NF-H was observed in the majority of ganglion cells in SP and MP throughout the fetal period. It was determined that there was no NF-H reaction in some ganglion cells in Peyer's patches of internal submucosal plexus (ISPF). In the early stage of pregnancy (60-90 days), there was no expression of NSE and S1006 in ileum. After this period, NSE and S1006 were expressed in the ganglion cells of the plexus, indicating an increase in the amount of expression towards the end of pregnancy. In the early period, vimentin expression was only detected in intramuscular interstitial cells (ICs) (60-90 days), but later (90-150 days) it was also seen in the cells around the ganglion cells in the plexus. On days 60-90 of gestation, GFAP expression only occurred in MP, but in later stages, staining was also detected in SP. In the plexus, an immunoreactivity was present in EGCs forming a network around the ganglion cell. During the last period of gestation (120-150 days), the number of GFAP-positive plexus increased, with the majority of these stained cells being observed in MP. Interestingly, weak staining or reaction did not occur in ISPF, unlike other plexuses. In conclusion, this is the first study that demonstrated the expression of NF-H, vimentin, S100A6, NSE and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal ENS in the prenatal period. In the last period of gestation (120-150 days), the expression profile of ENS was similar to that of adult animals. The expression of the used markers increased toward the end of pregnancy. Our results suggest that neurons and EGCs show heterogeneity, and GFAP and NF-H cannot be used as panenteric glial or panneuronal markers, respectively. We also demonstrated, for the first time, the prenatal expression of S100A6 in enteric neurons and the possibility of using this protein for the identification of enteric neurons.\"\n"

We have previously shown that HMGB1 is translocated from the nucleus to cytosolic compartment after ischemic brain injury in fetal sheep. In the current study, we utilized the Rice-Vannucci model to investigate the time course of HMGB1 translocation and release after HI injury in neonatal rats. HMGB1 was located in cellular nuclei of brains from sham control rats. Nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 was detected in the ipsilateral-HI hemisphere as early as zero h after HI, and released extracellularly as early as 6\\u202fh after HI. Immunohistochemical double staining detected HMGB1 translocation mainly in neurons along with release from apoptotic cells after HI. Serum HMGB1 increased at 3\\u202fh and decreased by 24\\u202fh after HI. In addition, rat brains exposed to hypoxic injury alone also exhibited time dependent HMGB1 translocation at 3, 12 and 48\\u202fh after hypoxia.

      "Abstract :'Kinases in signaling pathways are commonly activated by multisite phosphorylation. For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk is activated by its kinase Mek by two consecutive phosphorylations within its activation loop. In this article, we use kinetic models to study how the activation of Erk is coupled to its abundance. Intuitively, Erk activity should rise with increasing amounts of Erk protein. However, a mathematical model shows that the signaling off state is robust to increasing amounts of Erk, and Erk activity may even decline with increasing amounts of Erk. This counterintuitive, bell-shaped response of Erk activity to increasing amounts of Erk arises from the competition of the unmodified and single phosphorylated form of Erk for access to its kinase Mek. This shows that phosphorylation cycles can contain an intrinsic robustness mechanism that protects signaling from aberrant activation e.g., by gene expression noise or kinase overexpression after gene duplication events in diseases like cancer.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The complement system resembles a double-edged sword since its activation can either benefit or harm the host. Thus, regulation of this system is of utmost importance and performed by several circulating and membrane-bound complement inhibitors. The pool of well-established regulators has recently been enriched with proteins that either share structural homology to known complement inhibitors such as Sushi domain-containing (SUSD) protein family and Human CUB and Sushi multiple domains (CSMD) families or extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules that interact with and modulate complement activity. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about newly discovered complement inhibitors and discuss their implications in complement regulation, as well as in processes beyond complement regulation such cancer development. Understanding the behavior of these proteins will introduce new mechanisms of complement regulation and may provide new avenues in the development of novel therapies.'\n",

      "Abstract :'INTRODUCTION: Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) increased significantly over the last decades. Lack of response to chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of this disease. This study aims to assess the biological relevance of characteristic microRNA profiles of chemotherapy resistant EAC cells with regards to response to chemotherapy and biological behavior.\\n\\nMETHODS: We selected 3 microRNAs from characteristic microRNA profiles of resistant EAC (miR-27b-3p, miR-200b-3p, and miR-148a-3p). Expression of microRNAs was modified in 6 EAC cell lines. Effects on chemotherapy, adhesion, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle were assessed using standard assays. Target analyses were performed using Western Blot and Luciferase techniques.\\n\\nRESULTS: MiR-27b-3p significantly sensitized cells to 5FU and Cisplatin in 83% respectively in 33% of cell lines, miR-148a-3p in 67% respectively 33% of cases. MiR-200b-3p increased sensitivity only towards 5FU in 50% of cases. Co-transfections with miR-27b-3p/miR-148a-3p showed an additive effect on response to chemotherapy in 50% of cases. Upregulation of miR-148a-3p reduced protein expression levels of DNMT-1, MSK-1, Bcl-2 and Bim, and miR-27b upregulation led to downregulation of Sp1 and PPARy proteins implicating a potential negative post-transcriptional control via the respective microRNAs. Finally, we were able to confirm Bcl-2 for the first time as direct target of miR-148a-3p in EAC.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that specific microRNA profiles of chemotherapy resistant EAC in fact determine their response to chemotherapy and biological behavior. Our data further show that microRNA-mediated regulation of chemotherapy resistance is complex, and several microRNAs seem to \"co-operate\" at various steps within a broad number of pathways what fits very well to our recently proposed understanding of microRNA-mediated regulation as function of cellular functional complexes. These data highlight the promising potential of microRNAs to predict or monitor treatment response to chemotherapy in EAC, and to potentially modulate tumor biology in a therapeutic approach.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Staphylococcus aureus infection is a major burden for individuals with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and a known inducer of disease exacerbation. This increased susceptibility to staphylococcal infections has been attributed to abnormalities in the innate immune system of atopic dermatitis (AD) skin, including deficits in barrier proteins and lipids, and a muted response in generating antimicrobial peptides, all of which is further impaired by the activation of Th2 and Th22 immune pathways, which characterizes AD. Skewing of the immune response with a reduced Th1:Th2 ratio and increased adherence of bacteria to AD skin are also thought to contribute. Bacterial species diversity is reduced with flares, concomitant with increases in S. aureus and sometimes clinical infection, which has recently been linked to the finding that commensal bacteria produce anti-S. aureus factors that contribute to the endogenous response. S. aureus produces several virulence factors affecting the skin barrier and immune system, including promoting Th2 cell activation. Best practices for the management of staphylococcal infections include systemic antibiotics, initiation of antiseptics (particularly dilute bleach baths), and sometimes periodic intranasal mupirocin. Newer evidence suggests the possibility that treatment of the skin with commensal bacterial species could also reduce S. aureus growth and increase diversity.'\n"

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Rhein (4, 5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid), a natural anthraquinone derivative, is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used as a medication in many Asian countries. It has been used as a laxative and stomach drug for a long time in both China and Korea. It is well-known to have many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrosis, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective properties. However, little is known about how rhein may affect the differentiation activities in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells.\\n\\nPURPOSE: The present study was designed to examine the anti-leukemic effects of rhein against APL cells and to explore the underlying mechanism.\\n\\nMETHODS: Cell viability was investigated by MTS assay. To examine the differentiation activities in APL cells, the cell surface molecules (CD11b, CD14, CCR1 and CCR2), phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Also, induction of caspase-3 activity and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry. RNA and protein expressions were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study we assessed the role of rhein in treating APL. Interestingly, rhein potentiated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced macrophage differentiation in NB4 cells by inducing changes in morphology, expression of the differentiation markers CD11b and CD14, ROS production, phagocytic activity, and expression of CCR1 and CCR2. Signaling through CD11b was found to be dependent on ERK activation. Additionally, rhein induced APL cell death by activating apoptosis and suppressing the mTOR pathway.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, we suggest that a combination of rhein and ATRA carries strong therapeutic potential through the beneficial differentiation of APL cells. Moreover, rhein causes cell death via the activation of apoptosis and suppression of survival signals in APL cells. In combination with the ability of rhein to promote functional macrophage differentiation in APL, these properties suggest that a combined treatment of rhein and ATRA has great potential as an anti-leukemic therapy for APL.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Obese subjects have been considered to be in a state of chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation. Excess fat accumulation and persistent inflammation may promote renal dysfunction, to cause chronic kidney disease (CKD) and even end-stage kidney failure. Coptidis Rhizoma is a classical traditional Chinese herb well known for its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. The mechanism is partially associated with its anti-inflammatory effect. However, this effect is rarely investigated in obesity and obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG).\\n\\nPURPOSE: The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of Coptidis Rhizoma on ORG. It also aimed to determine whether this renal protection effect of Coptidis Rhizoma was related to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in ORG.\\n\\nMETHODS: Coptidis Rhizoma concentrated granules were prepared and the main components were identified by 3D-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (3D-HPLC) assay. The animal model of early stage ORG was established in obesity-prone (OP) rats by high protein and high fat diet feeding for 12 weeks. The treatment with Coptidis Rhizoma at different dosages was administered by intragastric infusion simultaneously. Then body weight, kidney weight, plasma lipid profiles, 24\\u202fh urine protein/albumin content and kidney histology were measured. Inflammatory biomarkers were examined both in the rat plasma and renal cortex. The gene expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and NF-κB in renal tissues were also measured.\\n\\nRESULTS: Coptidis Rhizoma alleviated dyslipidemia and reduced the renal weight of the rats with ORG. Meanwhile, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine clearance rate were significantly improved. Coptidis Rhizoma also attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial hyperplasia, and effacement of podocyte foot in renal tissues of ORG rats. In addition, Coptidis Rhizoma intervention decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18) both in plasma and renal tissue. The gene expression of NLRP3 inflammasome was down-regulated and NF-κB activity was also inhibited by Coptidis Rhizoma in renal tissues of ORG rats.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Coptidis Rhizoma can ameliorate early renal damage in ORG rats and the mechanisms appear to be related to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome complex.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the most prominent complication attributing to poor pregnancy and neonatal outcome. Infection is most commonly implicated in preterm birth; it initiates a cascade of inflammatory events that leads to the rupture of fetal membranes and spontaneous uterine contractions. Anti-inflammatory agents may thus be a therapeutic approach to prevent the premature rupture of fetal membranes and block contractions. In non-gestational tissues, the polyphenol honokiol has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties.\\n\\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of honokiol on pro-inflammatory mediators in human gestational tissues.\\n\\nMETHODS: Fetal membranes, myometrium and freshly isolated amnion cells and primary myometrial cells were treated with honokiol in the absence or presence of the products lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (fsl-1), the viral dsRNA analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF or IL1B. A luciferase assay was used to determine the effect of honokiol on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) RelA transcriptional activity.\\n\\nRESULTS: Honokiol significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL1A, IL6) and chemokine (CXCL8, CXCL1, CCL2) mRNA expression and secretion from fetal membranes (amnion and choriodecidua) and myometrium stimulated with LPS, fsl-1 or poly(I:C). In amnion cells, honokiol also significantly decreased the expression and secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP9. Moreover, in myometrium, honokiol significantly suppressed the expression of the contraction associated protein PTGFR, the secretion of the uterotonic prostaglandins PGE and PGF and blocked TNF-induced myometrial cell contractility. Finally, honokiol significantly suppressed IL1B- and TNF-induced NF-κB RelA transcriptional activity in primary amnion and myometrial cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Honokiol reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators in human amnion, choriodecidua and myometrium and that this may be facilitated through the suppression of NF-κB activation. These results indicate that the polyphenol honokiol may be a potent therapeutic for the prevention of preterm birth.'\n"

Rats received 500\\xa0mg SP/kg BW by gastric gavage over 4 weeks.\\n\\nRESULTS: Our data revealed that nicotine induced renal dysfunction manifested by significant abnormal levels of kidney function markers (creatinine and urea) accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress biomarker (malondialdehyde) and inflammatory markers (nitric oxide, Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) while antioxidant status as glutathione level and glutathione S-transferase activity were found to be decreased significantly as compared with controls. It is worthy to note that nicotine toxicity induced significant increments in the protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B as well as caspase-3. Histopathological observations showed tubular necrosis and congestion in the endothelial lining glomerular tuft and epithelial lining renal tubules with nicotine intoxication. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that SP supplementation significantly improved the nicotine-induced kidney dysfunction, alleviated the induced-lipid peroxidation, inflammatory, apoptotic protein markers, and boosted the enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants. Moreover, it attenuated the nicotine-induced histopathological alterations of the kidney architecture.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Thus, it is tempting to recommend dietary approaches with Spirulina platensis extract for smokers to minimize the deleterious effect of chronic nicotine consumption and smoke exposure-related problems towards kidney injury via the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of Spirulina platensis.'\n",

Many axSpA patients are classified as 'CRP-negative', or CRP normal, despite having levels close to the ULN, and are therefore formally ineligible for treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the likelihood of a CRP test indicating elevated levels in axSpA patients that have previously tested CRP normal.\\n\\nMETHODS: RAPID-axSpA (NCT01087762) enrolled patients who were either magnetic resonance imaging positive or had elevated CRP (>\\u2009ULN: 7.9\\xa0mg/L).

Our previous genome-wide methylation profile showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8 like 3 (TIPE3) was hypermethylated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the relationship between TIPE3 methylation and its mRNA expression, as well as its biological roles in NPC are unknown.\\n\\nMETHODS: Bisulfite pyrosequencing and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to quantify the TIPE3 methylation and expression levels. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate the correlation between TIPE3 methylation levels and survival in two patient cohorts collected from two hospitals (n\\u2009=\\u2009441). The MTT, colony formation, Transwell migration and invasion assays, and xenograft tumor growth and lung metastatic colonization models were used to identify the functions of TIPE3 on NPC cells.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that TIPE3 CpG island (CGI) was hypermethylated and its mRNA levels were downregulated in many cancers, including NPC. TIPE3 downregulation was associated with its CGI hypermethylation. Furthermore, NPC patients with high TIPE3 CGI methylation levels had poorer clinical outcomes than those with low methylation levels. The TIPE3 CGI methylation level was an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, restoring TIPE3 expression significantly inhibited NPC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and lung metastatic colonization in vivo, while silencing TIPE3 acted in an opposite way.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: TIPE3 downregulation correlates with its CGI hypermethylation in several solid cancers. TIPE3 acts as a tumor suppressor in NPC, providing a further insight into NPC progression and representing a potential prognostic biomarker for NPC.'\n",

Chloride channels are promising cancer biomarkers, and their family member chloride channel-3 (CLC-3) is involved in multiple biological behaviors. However, whether CLC-3 is a prognostic biomarker for GC patients is rarely reported. The molecular mechanisms by which CLC-3 is regulated in GC are unclear.\\n\\nMETHODS: The expression of CLC-3 and XRCC5 in human specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The primary biological functions and pathways related to CLC-3 were enriched by RNA sequencing. A 5'-biotin-labeled DNA probe with a promoter region between -\\u2009248 and +\\u2009226 was synthesized to pull down CLC-3 promoter-binding proteins. Functional studies were detected by MTS, clone formation, wound scratch, transwell, and xenograft mice model. Mechanistic studies were investigated by streptavidin-agarose-mediated DNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, ChIP, dual-luciferase reporter assay system, Co-IP, and immunofluorescence.\\n\\nRESULTS: The results showed that CLC-3 was overexpressed in human GC tissues and that overexpression of CLC-3 was a poor prognostic biomarker for GC patients (P\\u2009=\\u20090.012). Furthermore, higher expression of CLC-3 was correlated with deeper tumor invasion (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) and increased lymph node metastasis (P\\u2009=\\u20090.016), and knockdown of CLC-3 inhibited cell proliferation and migration in vitro. In addition, X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5) was identified as a CLC-3 promoter-binding protein, and both CLC-3 (HR 1.671; 95% CI 1.012-2.758; P\\u2009=\\u20090.045) and XRCC5 (HR 1.795; 95% CI 1.076-2.994; P\\u2009=\\u20090.025) were prognostic factors of overall survival in GC patients. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that the expression and function of CLC-3 were inhibited after XRCC5 knockdown, and the inhibition effects were rescued by CLC-3 overexpression. Meanwhile, the expression and function of CLC-3 were promoted after XRCC5 overexpression, and the promotion effects were reversed by the CLC-3 knockdown. The mechanistic study revealed that knockdown of XRCC5 suppressed the binding of XRCC5 to the CLC-3 promoter and subsequent promoter activity, thus regulating CLC-3 expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with PARP1.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that overexpression of CLC-3 is regulated by XRCC5 and is a poor prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.

At present, precision molecular targeted therapeutics directed toward NSCLC driven genes has made great progress and significantly improved the overall survival of patients with NSCLC, but can easily lead to acquired drug resistance. New methods are needed to develop real-time monitoring of drug efficacy and drug resistance, such as new molecular markers for more effective early detection and prediction of prognosis. Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles, containing proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, which are secreted by various cells, and they play an important role in the development of lung cancer by controlling a wide range of pathways. Tumor-derived exosomes are of great significance for guiding the targeted therapy of NSCLC and exosomes themselves can be a target for treatment.

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND: Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito borne tropical viral disease affecting hundreds of millions of people across the globe annually. The dengue virus (DENV) includes four genetically distinct serotypes that cause serious life-threatening infections, including dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Dengue vaccine development is complicated by the possibility of vaccine-enhanced severe dengue disease due to antibody-dependent enhancement by pre-existing cross-reactivity, as well as homotypic antibodies. Thus, the development of an efficacious dengue vaccine conferring simultaneous and durable immunity to each of the four DENV serotypes has not yet been developed despite years of research. For mass immunization in deeply affected resource-limited countries, oral vaccination is considered more beneficial than conventional approaches. Therefore, in a continuing effort towards designing economical and potent vaccine candidates, the current study applied yeast surface display technology to develop an oral dengue vaccine candidate using whole recombinant yeast cells displaying the recombinant fusion protein of M cell targeting ligand Co1 fused to the synthetic consensus dengue envelope domain III (scEDIII). Female Balb/c mice were orally fed with recombinant yeast cells and immunogenicity in terms of systemic and mucosal immune responses was monitored.\\n\\nRESULTS: Immunofluorescence microscopy with dengue specific antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody clearly showed that recombinant protein Co1-scEDIII-AGA was localized on the cell surface of the respective clones in comparison with scEDIII-Co1 and Mock cells with no fluorescence. Oral dosage applications of surface displayed Co1-scEDIII-AGA stimulated a systemic humoral immune response in the form of dengue-specific serum IgG, as well as a mucosal immune response in the form of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Antigen-specific B cell responses in isolated lymphoid cells from the spleen and Peyer's patches further supported an elevated mucosal immune response. In addition, surface displayed Co1-scEDIII-AGA feeding elicited strong immune responses in comparison with scEDIII-Co1 and Mock following intraperitoneal booster with purified scEDIII antigen.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Surface displayed preparations of Co1-scEDIII-AGA induced strong immunogenicity compared with non-displayed scEDIII-Co1. Prior studies have supported the neutralization potential of scEDIII constructs against all four serotypes. Thus, the oral administration of genetically engineered yeast whole cells displaying biologically active Co1-scEDIII fusion protein without any further processing shows prospective as a potent oral vaccine candidate against dengue viral infection.\"\n"

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND: Sports Dietitians aim to assist in improving performance by developing nutrition knowledge (NK), enhancing dietary intake and optimising body composition of athletes. In a high-pressure environment, it is important to identify factors that may compromise an athlete's nutrition status. Body composition assessments are regularly undertaken in sport to provide feedback on training adaptions; however, no research has explored the impact of these assessments on the dietary intake of professional athletes.\\n\\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed dietary intake (7-day food diary), nutrition knowledge (Nutrition for Sport Knowledge Questionnaire) and body composition (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) of 46 professional male Australian football (AFL) athletes during a 2017 pre-season training week (7\\xa0days) where body composition assessments were undertaken. Dietary intake was assessed against International Olympic Committee recommendations for professional athletes.\\n\\nRESULTS: Overall, no athlete met dietary their recommended energy intake (15\\u2009±\\u20091.1 vs. 9.1\\u2009±\\u20091.8\\xa0MJ, respectively) or carbohydrate recommendations (6-10 vs. 2.4\\u2009±\\u20090.9\\xa0g·kg-1·day-1). Only 54% met protein recommendations. Secondary analyses demonstrated significant associations between education status and energy intake (P\\xa0<\\u20090.04) and vegetable intake (P\\xa0<\\u20090.03), with higher levels of education being associated with higher intakes. A moderately positive association was observed between NK scores and meeting estimated energy requirements (r\\xa0=\\u20090.33, P\\xa0=\\u20090.03). NK scores were also positively associated with protein (r\\xa0=\\u20090.35, P\\xa0=\\u20090.02), fibre (r\\xa0=\\u20090.51, P\\xa0=\\u20090.001) and calcium intakes (r\\xa0=\\u20090.43, P\\xa0=\\u20090.004).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This research identified that the dietary intake of professional AFL athletes during a pre-season training week where body composition assessments were undertaken did not meet current recommendations. Several factors may influence the dietary intake of AFL athletes, including lower education levels, poor NK and dietary intake restriction surrounding body composition assessment. Athletes may require support to continue with performance-based nutrition plans in periods surrounding body composition assessment.\"\n",

However, which genes influence the productivity of desired proteins in K. marxianus has so far been investigated by very few studies.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study, we constructed a K. marxianus recombinant (FIM1/Est1E), which expressed the heterologous ruminal feruloyl esterase Est1E as reporter. UV-Co-γ irradiation mutagenesis was performed on this recombinant, and one mutant (be termed as T1) was screened and reported, in which the productivity of heterologous Est1E was increased by at least tenfold compared to the parental FIM1/Est1E recombinant. Transcriptional perturbance was profiled and presented that the intracellular vesicle trafficking was enhanced while autophagy be weakened in the T1 mutant. Moreover, whole-genome sequencing combined with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene-editing identified a novel functional protein Mtc6p, which was prematurely terminated at Tyr251 by deletion of a single cytosine at 755 loci of its ORF in the T1 mutant. We found that deleting C755 of MTC6 in FIM1 led to 4.86-fold increase in the production of Est1E compared to FIM1, while the autophagy level decreased by 47%; on the contrary, when reinstating C755 of MTC6 in the T1 mutant, the production of Est1E decreased by 66% compared to T1, while the autophagy level increased by 124%. Additionally, in the recombinant with attenuated autophagy (i.e., FIM1 mtc6 and T1) or interdicted autophagy (i.e., FIM1 atg1Δ and T1 atg1Δ), the productivity of three other heterologous proteins was also increased, specifically the heterologous mannase Man330, the β-1,4-endoxylanase XynCDBFV or the conventional EGFP.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Mtc6p was involved in regulating autophagy; attenuating or interdicting autophagy would dramatically improve the yields of desired proteins in K. marxianus, and this modulation could be achieved by focusing on the premature mutation of Mtc6p target.'\n",

Expression of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a transcription factor, is highly restricted to epithelial cells in hormone-regulated tissues. MYC and its negative regulator MAD1 play an important role in BC progression. Previously, we found that PDEF expression is strongly correlated with AR expression. However, the relationship between AR and PDEF and the function of PDEF in ER-negative BC proliferation are unclear.\\n\\nMETHODS: AR and PDEF expression in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines was determined by performing immunohistochemistry or western blotting. Protein expression levels and location were analysed by performing western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to validate the regulation of AR-PDEF-MAD1-MYC axis. Moreover, the effect of AR and PDEF on BC progression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that PDEF was overexpressed in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines and appeared to function as an oncogene. PDEF expression levels were strongly correlated with AR expression in ER-negative BC, and PDEF transcription was positively regulated by AR. PDEF upregulated MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative BC. Finally, we found that compared with the inhibition of AR expression alone, simultaneous inhibition of AR and PDEF expression further suppressed tumour proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the role of the AR-PDEF-MAD1-MYC axis in BC progression and suggest that PDEF can be used as a new clinical therapeutic target for treating ER-negative BC.'\n",

Nectin-4 protein levels in pre-eclamptic placentas were higher on a semi-quantitative western blot. Nectin-4 was localized at the apical cell membrane in syncytiotrophoblast cells and not at the adherens junctions. Nectin-4 was also detected in cytotrophoblasts and a subset of cells in the decidua.

The causative gene of L-2-HGA is L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene (L2HGDH), which consists of 10 exons.\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION: We presented a rare patient primary diagnosis of L-2-HGA based on the clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results.

      "Abstract :\"BACKGROUND: Our previous study found that more than 500 transcripts significantly increased in abundance in the zebrafish and mouse several hours to days postmortem relative to live controls. The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions. We rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3- to 9- mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome and that these features putatively serve as binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation.\\n\\nRESULTS: We identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively, which represents less than 1.5% of all possible features. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3' untranslated regions of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the open reading frames of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the open reading frames of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked 3' or 5' untranslated regions. These results suggest the transcripts with high density of features might serve as 'molecular sponges' that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, and thus indirectly increase the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some of the features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress, such as organismal death, have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome. Some of these features serve as putative binding sites for proteins and non-coding RNAs that determine transcript stability and fate. A small number of the transcripts have high density sequence features, which are presumably involved in sequestering RNA binding proteins and microRNAs and thus preventing regulatory interactions among other transcripts. Our results provide baseline data on post-transcriptional regulation in stressful conditions that has implications for regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.\"\n",

Moreover, this family provides potential targets for the design of insecticides. In contrast to a large number of studies conducted on Drosophila melanogaster, molecular studies to characterize TRP channels in agricultural pests are lacking.\\n\\nRESULTS: In this study, we identified 15 TRP channel genes in the genome of a notorious agricultural pest, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). Comparative analysis of the TRP channels (TRPs) in B. dorsalis with those in D. melanogaster, Glossina morsitans, Musca domestica and the closely related Ceratitis capitata, and TRPs from mosquitoes, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera reveals that members of TRPA and TRPP subfamily are most diverse among insects. The results also suggest that Tephritidae family have two TRP-Polycystin 2 members even though most insects either possess just one or none. The highest expression levels of these two genes are in the testes of B. dorsalis, implying a role in regulating sperm function. We analyzed the expression profiles of the TRP channels identified in this study at different life stages using quantitative real time PCR. The results of this study demonstrate that all TRP channels are mainly expressed in adults, especially at mature stages. The one exception to this trend is BdTRPM, which is more highly expressed in the eggs of B. dorsalis, implying an important role in early development. We also detected the spatial expression of TRP channels in mature adult fruit flies by investigating expression levels within various tissues including those involved in sensory function, such as antennae, compound eyes, mouthparts, legs, and wings, as well as tissues critical for homeostasis and physiology (i.e., Malpighian tubules, the brain and gut as well as fat bodies, ovaries, and testes).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study establish a solid foundation for future functional characterization of B. dorsalis TRP channels as well as those of other insects and will help future insecticide design targeting these channels.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Protein transfection is a versatile tool to study or manipulate cellular processes and also shows great therapeutic potential. However, the repertoire of cost effective techniques for efficient and minimally cytotoxic delivery remains limited. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are multifunctional nanocarriers for cellular delivery of a wide range of molecules, they are simple and economical to synthesize and have shown great promise for protein delivery. In this work we present a general strategy to optimize the delivery of active protein to the nucleus. We generated a bimolecular Venus based optical sensor that exclusively detects active and bioavailable protein for the performance of multi-parameter optimisation of protein delivery. In conjunction with cell viability tests we maximized MSN protein delivery and biocompatibility and achieved highly efficient protein transfection rates of 80%. Using the sensor to measure live-cell protein delivery kinetics, we observed heterogeneous timings within cell populations which could have a confounding effect on function studies. To address this problem we fused a split or dimerisation dependent protein of interest to chemically induced dimerisation (CID) components, permitting control over its activity following cellular delivery. Using the split Venus protein we directly show that addition of a small molecule dimerizer causes synchronous activation of the delivered protein across the entire cell population. This combination of cellular delivery and triggered activation provides a defined starting point for functional studies and could be applied to other protein transfection methods.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Autophagy primarily works to counteract nutrient deprivation that is strongly engaged during starvation and hypoxia, which happens in hypoperfusion. Nonetheless, autophagy is slightly active even in baseline conditions, when it is useful to remove aged proteins and organelles. This is critical when the mitochondria and/or proteins are damaged by toxic stimuli. In the present review, we discuss to that extent the recruitment of autophagy is beneficial in counteracting brain hypoperfusion or, vice-versa, its overactivity may per se be detrimental for cell survival. While analyzing these opposite effects, it turns out that the autophagy activity is likely not to be simply good or bad for cell survival, but its role varies depending on the timing and amount of autophagy activation. This calls for the need for an appropriate autophagy tuning to guarantee a beneficial effect on cell survival. Therefore, the present article draws a theoretical pattern of autophagy activation, which is hypothesized to define the appropriate timing and intensity, which should mirrors the duration and severity of brain hypoperfusion. The need for a fine tuning of the autophagy activation may explain why confounding outcomes occur when autophagy is studied using a rather simplistic approach.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as the main body storage compartment for vitamin A through retinyl ester (RE)-filled lipid droplets (LDs). Upon liver injury, HSCs adopt a myofibroblastic phenotype characterized by an elevated expression of extracellular matrix proteins and a concomitant loss of LDs. On the one hand, LD breakdown has been suggested to provide the energy required for HSC activation into myofibroblast-like cells. On the other hand, this process could mitigate HSC activation following the transformation of released REs into retinoic acids (RAs), ligands for nuclear receptors exerting antifibrotic transcriptional regulatory activities in HSCs. Importantly, RAs may also constitute a means for HSCs to orchestrate the liver response to injury by triggering transcriptional effects in multiple additional surrounding liver cell populations. We envision that new approaches, such as single-cell technologies, will allow to better define how RAs are issued from LD loss in HSCs exert a multicellular control of the liver (patho)physiology.'\n",

However, previous studies failed to consistently demonstrate a major role for AMPK on eNOS-dependent relaxation. As AMPK also phosphorylates eNOS on the inhibitory Thr495 site, this study aimed to determine the role of AMPKα1 and α2 subunits in the regulation of NO-mediated vascular relaxation. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine and acetylcholine was assessed in aortic and carotid artery segments from mice with global (AMPKα) or endothelial-specific deletion (AMPKα) of the AMPKα subunits. In control and AMPKα1-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177 and Thr495 was assessed after AMPK activation with thiopental or ionomycin. Global deletion of the AMPKα1 or α2 subunit in mice did not affect vascular reactivity. The endothelial-specific deletion of the AMPKα1 subunit attenuated phenylephrine-mediated contraction in an eNOS- and endothelium-dependent manner. In in vitro studies, activation of AMPK did not alter the phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1177, but increased its phosphorylation on Thr495. Depletion of AMPKα1 in cultured human endothelial cells decreased Thr495 phosphorylation without affecting Ser1177 phosphorylation. The results of this study indicate that AMPKα1 targets the inhibitory phosphorylation Thr495 site in the calmodulin-binding domain of eNOS to attenuate basal NO production and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction.'\n",

The intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) is involved in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. The presence of the  polymorphism of the  gene appears to be involved in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. We explored the possible association of the Ala54Thr polymorphism with fat intolerance in apparently healthy, fasting, normolipidemic subjects with normal body-mass index and without diabetes.  A total of 158 apparently healthy individuals were classified as fat tolerant ( = 123) or intolerant ( = 35) according to their response (plasma triglycerides) to an oral abbreviated tolerance test with blood samples taken at 0, 2 and 4 h. At 0 h, all subjects ingested 26.3 g of fats. Presence of the Ala54Thr polymorphism of the  gene was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction⁻restriction fragment length (PCR⁻RFLP).  The group with fat intolerance (postprandial hypertriglyceridemia group) showed an increased frequency of the Thr54Thr genotype when compared with the group with normal fat tolerance (control group) (23% vs. 4%, respectively, OR: 16.53, 95% CI: 4.09⁻66.82, : 0.0001, pc: 0.0003).

De novo sequencing alone was able to identify 58 additional peptides, and this approach contributed significantly to the comprehensive description of the venom. Abundant protein families comprise 3FTxs (22.3%), KSPIs (19%), acetylcholinesterases (12.6%), PLA₂s (11.9%), venom endothelial growth factors (VEGFs, 8.4%), nucleotidases (4.3%), and C-type lectin-like proteins (snaclecs, 3.3%); an additional 11 toxin families are present at significantly lower concentrations, including complement depleting factors, a family not previously detected in  venoms.

      "Abstract :'A risk of ischemic stroke increases exponentially after menopause. Even a mild-ischemic stroke can result in increased frailty. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes, which subsequently increases risk of cerebrovascular events and severe cognitive decline, particularly after menopause. Several interventions to reduce frailty and subsequent risk of stroke and cognitive decline have been proposed in laboratory animals and patients. One of them is whole body vibration (WBV). WBV improves cerebral function and cognitive ability that deteriorates with increased frailty. The goal of the current study is to test the efficacy of WBV in reducing post-ischemic stroke frailty and brain damage in reproductively senescent female rats. Reproductively senescent Sprague-Dawley female rats were exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and were randomly assigned to either WBV or no-WBV groups. Animals placed in the WBV group underwent 30 days of WBV (40 Hz) treatment performed twice daily for 15 min each session, 5 days each week. The motor functions of animals belonging to both groups were tested intermittently and at the end of the treatment period. Brains were then harvested for inflammatory markers and histopathological analysis. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in inflammatory markers and infarct volume with significant increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and improvement in functional activity after tMCAO in middle-aged female rats that were treated with WBV as compared to the no-WBV group. Our results may facilitate a faster translation of the WBV intervention for improved outcome after stroke, particularly among frail women.'\n",

We investigated the anticancer activity of MHY2256 against hormone-related cancer, an endometrial cancer with a poor prognosis. The IC values of MHY2256 were shown to be much lower than those of salermide, a well-known SIRT inhibitor. Furthermore, MHY2256 significantly reduced the protein expression and activities of SIRT1, 2, and 3, with similar effects to salermide. Particularly, MHY2256 markedly inhibited tumor growth in a tumor xenograft mouse model of Ishikawa cancer cells. During the experimental period, there was no significant change in the body weight of mice treated with MHY2256. A detailed analysis of the sensitization mechanisms of Ishikawa cells revealed that late apoptosis was largely increased by MHY2256. Additionally, MHY2256 increased G1 arrest and reduced the number of cell cyclic-related proteins, suggesting that apoptosis by MHY2256 was achieved by cellular arrest. Particularly, p21 was greatly increased by MHY225656, suggesting that cell cycle arrest by p21 is a major factor in MHY2256 sensitization in Ishikawa cells. We also detected a significant increase in acetylated p53, a target protein of SIRT1, in Ishikawa cells after MHY2256 treatment. In a mouse xenograft model, MHY2256 significantly reduced tumor growth and weight without apparent side effects. These results suggest that MHY2256 exerts its anticancer activity through p53 acetylation in endometrial cancer and can be used for targeting hormone-related cancers.'\n",

Interestingly, HIV-1 group-M subtypes display differences in the rate of disease progression. However, few reports investigated how the cellular behaviors and activities of Nef isolates from reference strains may differ between HIV-1 group-M subtypes. Here, we characterize how differing cellular distributions of Nef proteins across group-M subtypes may impact protein function using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. We demonstrate that Nef variants isolated from HIV-1 group-M subtypes display differences in expression, with low expressing Nef proteins from reference strains of subtypes G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) also displaying decreased functionality. Additionally, we demonstrate variations in the subcellular distribution and localization of these Nef proteins. Nef from subtype G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) reference strains also failed to colocalize with the trans-Golgi network, and were not differentially localized to cellular markers of multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. Strikingly, our results demonstrate that HIV-1 Nef proteins from reference strains G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) highly colocalize with labeled mitochondrial compartments.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The landscape of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) affecting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human cancers remains largely unexplored. While the majority of lncRNAs remain to be functionally characterized, several have been implicated in cancer development and metastasis. Considering the plethora of lncRNAs genes that have been currently reported, it is conceivable that many more lncRNAs might function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. We devised a strategy to detect focal lncRNA SCNAs using a custom DNA microarray platform probing 10,519 lncRNA genes. By screening a panel of 80 cancer cell lines, we detected numerous focal aberrations targeting one or multiple lncRNAs without affecting neighboring protein-coding genes. These focal aberrations are highly suggestive for a tumor suppressive or oncogenic role of the targeted lncRNA gene. Although functional validation remains an essential step in the further characterization of the involved candidate cancer lncRNAs, our results provide a direct way of prioritizing candidate lncRNAs that are involved in cancer pathogenesis.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Ricin A chain (RTA) depurinates the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) by interacting with the C-termini of the ribosomal P stalk. The ribosome interaction site and the active site are located on opposite faces of RTA. The interaction with P proteins allows RTA to depurinate the SRL on the ribosome at physiological pH with an extremely high activity by orienting the active site towards the SRL. Therefore, if an inhibitor disrupts RTA⁻ribosome interaction by binding to the ribosome binding site of RTA, it should inhibit the depurination activity. To test this model, we synthesized peptides mimicking the last 3 to 11 amino acids of P proteins and examined their interaction with wild-type RTA and ribosome binding mutants by Biacore. We measured the inhibitory activity of these peptides on RTA-mediated depurination of yeast and rat liver ribosomes. We found that the peptides interacted with the ribosome binding site of RTA and inhibited depurination activity by disrupting RTA⁻ribosome interactions. The shortest peptide that could interact with RTA and inhibit its activity was four amino acids in length. RTA activity was inhibited by disrupting its interaction with the P stalk without targeting the active site, establishing the ribosome binding site as a new target for inhibitor discovery.'\n",

The thicknesses of the nanostructured poly-l-Lysine/poly-l-Glutamic acid polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) and the bone-like apatite barrier layer that make up the delivery system, were varied. The effects of the structural variations of the coating on the kinetics of cell access to a cytotoxic factor delivered by the layered structure were evaluated. FGF-2 was adsorbed into the outer PEM, and cytotoxic antimycin-A (AntiA) was adsorbed to the substrate below the barrier layer to detect the timing of the cell access. While MC3T3-E1 osteoprogenitor cells accessed AntiA after three days, the RAW 264.7 macrophage access occurred within 4 h, unless the PEM layer was removed, in which case the results were reversed. Pits were created in the coating by the RAW 264.7 macrophages and initiated delivery, while the osteoprogenitor cell access to drugs occurred through a solution-mediated coating dissolution, at junctions between the islands of crystals. Macrophage-mediated degradation is therefore a mechanism that controls drug release from coatings containing bioinspired apatite.'\n",

Amongst local non-B DNA structures, G-quadruplexes are perhaps the most well-characterized to date, and their presence has been demonstrated in many genomes, including that of humans. G-quadruplexes are selectively bound by many regulatory proteins. In this paper, we have analyzed the amino acid composition of all seventy-seven described G-quadruplex binding proteins of Homo sapiens. Our comparison with amino acid frequencies in all human proteins and specific protein subsets (e.g., all nucleic acid binding) revealed unique features of quadruplex binding proteins, with prominent enrichment for glycine (G) and arginine (R). Cluster analysis with bootstrap resampling shows similarities and differences in amino acid composition of particular quadruplex binding proteins. Interestingly, we found that all characterized G-quadruplex binding proteins share a 20 amino acid long motif/domain (RGRGR GRGGG SGGSG GRGRG) which is similar to the previously described RG-rich domain (RRGDG RRRGG GGRGQ GGRGR GGGFKG) of the FRM1 G-quadruplex binding protein. Based on this protein fingerprint, we have predicted a new set of potential G-quadruplex binding proteins sharing this interesting domain rich in glycine and arginine residues.'\n",

Although its significant influence has been established, the exact mechanisms of NO-derived products under metal-stress conditions are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the key components of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) metabolisms under cadmium (Cd) stress using Arabidopsis as the model plant. Exposure to Cd disturbed redox homeostasis and increased lipid peroxidation, thus triggering oxidative stress. Complementarily, Cd caused differential changes in the selected amino acids: a promotion in partial amino acids might be a genotype-specific trait, while the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity increased in a dose-dependent manner in shoots. Furthermore, NO production as well as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) activity were up-regulated by Cd with the simultaneous depletion of GSNO. Correspondingly, S-nitrosothiols were involved in generating peroxynitrite and tyrosine nitration of protein (NO-Tyr), in accordance with the regulation of NO-mediated post-translational modifications in antioxidant systems, including the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, amino acids and phenolic compounds, thereby provoking nitrosative stress. Our data provide comprehensive evidences regarding the clear relationships between the metabolisms of ROS and RNS, supporting the indicator role of NO-Tyr as a nitrosative stress in plants, and help to provide a better understanding of the ROS/RNS interaction under stress conditions.'\n",

This, combined HIV's high propensity to develop resistance, means that new antiviral agents against novel targets are still urgently required. We previously identified novel anti-HIV agents directed against the nuclear import of the HIV integrase (IN) protein, which plays critical roles in the HIV lifecycle inside the cell nucleus, as well as in transporting the HIV preintegration complex (PIC) into the nucleus. Here we investigate the structure activity relationship of a series of these compounds for the first time, including a newly identified anti-IN compound, budesonide, showing that the extent of binding to the IN core domain correlates directly with the ability of the compound to inhibit IN nuclear transport in a permeabilised cell system. Importantly, compounds that inhibited the nuclear transport of IN were found to significantly decrease HIV viral replication, even in a dividing cell system. Significantly, budesonide or its analogue flunisolide, were able to effect a significant reduction in the presence of specific nuclear forms of the HIV DNA (2-LTR circles), suggesting that the inhibitors work though blocking IN, and potentially PIC, nuclear import. The work presented here represents a platform for further development of these specific inhibitors of HIV replication with therapeutic and prophylactic potential.\"\n",

They consist of aggregated Aβ peptides, which are generated through sequential proteolytic processing of the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP) and several Aβ-associated factors. Efficient clearance of Aβ from the brain is thought to be important to prevent the development and progression of AD. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is one of the major pathways for protein breakdown in cells and it has been suggested that impaired UPS-mediated removal of protein aggregates could play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. To study the effects of an impaired UPS on Aβ pathology in\\xa0vivo, transgenic APP/PS1ΔE9 mice (APPPS1) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing mutant ubiquitin (UBB), a protein-based inhibitor of the UPS. Surprisingly, the APPPS1/UBB crossbreed showed a remarkable decrease in Aβ plaque load during aging. Further analysis showed that UBB expression transiently restored PS1-NTF expression and γ-secretase activity in APPPS1 mice. Concurrently, UBB decreased levels of β-APP-CTF, which is a γ-secretase substrate. Although UBB reduced Aβ pathology in APPPS1 mice, it did not improve the behavioral deficits in these animals.\"\n"

Because of its high organic and micronutrient content, this residue is used as a fertilizer on sugarcane crops. However, when used in large quantities, vinasse can saturate the soil and contaminate nearby water resources by percolation and leaching. Given the proven toxic potential of in natura vinasse, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxic potential of leached sugarcane vinasse using Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a test organism. A bioassay was performed after vinasse percolation in laboratory soil columns. The bioassay included one control group containing fresh water and two treatment groups, the first exposed to a 2,5% dilution of leached of vinasse and the second to a 2,5% dilution of in natura vinasse. After exposure, histopathological analysis was performed in gills and livers, and the latter were labelled for HSP70 proteins. No significant changes were detected in the gills of the exposed fish. However, in the liver, both in natura and leached vinasse induced statistically significant histopathological changes. These changes include hydropic degeneration, cell boundary losses, pyknotic nuclei and cellular disorganization. HSP70 expression significant increase in liver of both treatment groups were observed, being higher for the in natura vinasse exposed group. Results suggested that both leached vinasse and in natura vinasse were toxic, its still able to provoke histological changes and induce the cytoprotective response in exposed fish liver, evidenced by a immunostaining of cellular stress proteins.

Histopathological changes included disruption of spatial structure, pyknotic nuclei, cellular vacuolization and deformation of cell nuclei, in addition to marked swelling of hepatocytes in all treatment groups.

Pathway analysis revealed that cellular processes affected by CBZ included apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and the respiratory chain, indicating impaired energy homeostasis. Noteworthy was that 15 proteins identified as different in abundance were associated with carcinogenicity. Relative mRNA levels for select transcripts were consistent with the changes of proteins N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG), Tropomyosin 2-Beta (TPM2) and annexin A4 (ANXA4).

Our findings showed that MPs and Cd had no adverse effects on growth and survival. Under exposure to Cd, however, accumulation of Cd in the body of fish decreased with increasing MP concentrations as supported by a reduced metallothionein content. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase increased with MPs but decreased with Cd. MPs, Cd or the mixture increased catalase activity, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. Glutathione levels increased when exposed to high MP concentrations but decreased when co-exposed to Cd. Malondialdehyde content was only influenced by MPs and increased with elevated MPs. MPs or Cd alone did not increase protein carboxyl content but showed a synergistic effect and increased content. MPs or Cd alone showed no effect on lysozyme activity but had a synergistic effect and activated activity. Activities of both acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were enhanced by MPs, Cd or their mixture, although there was an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. In contrast, MPs, Cd or their mixture decreased complement 3 content, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors.

      "Abstract :'Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is mainly caused by the accumulation of lipofuscin and drusen on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Both oxidative stress and autophagic dysfunction accelerate the deposition of lipofuscin at the RPE. One of the key regulators in the response against oxidative stress is the NF-E2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2)-kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) axis, which is also closely associated with the autophagy pathway. Nrf2 activation upregulates the expression levels of certain anti-oxidative enzymes [e.g. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], which attenuates oxidative damage. However, until now, the relationship between cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation and autophagic degradation remain unclear. To address these questions, we investigated the effects of a novel Nrf2 activator, RS9, on RPE damage. We found that RS9 protected ARPE-19 cells against NaIO-induced oxidative damage, and that the protective effects of RS9 were inhibited by co-treatment with zinc protoporphyrin, an HO-1 inhibitor. Next, we examined the involvement of autophagic degradation in the protective effects of RS9. Co-treatment with RS9 and chloroquine, a lysosomal acidification inhibitor, inhibited the protective effect. Furthermore, western blotting and immunostaining showed that RS9 accelerated autophagy flux and induced transient upregulation of p62 [also known as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)]. Co-treatment with chloroquine and RS9 also inhibited the degradation of autophagosomes. Transient upregulation of SQSTM1 by RS9 was unaltered by HO-1 knockdown using siRNA. RS9 and chloroquine had the same actions in light damaged adult zebrafish retina as those in vitro. In conclusion, we clarified the relationship between acceleration of the autophagy pathway and the cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation in RPE cells and zebrafish retina. These findings indicated that Nrf2 activation could be a promising therapeutic approach for non-exudative AMD by supporting RPE maintenance.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration contributes largely to pathoanatomical and degenerative changes of spinal structure that increase the risk of low back pain. Apoptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) can aggravate IVD degeneration, and increasing studies have shown that interventions targeting NP cell apoptosis can ameliorate IVD degeneration, exhibiting their potential for use as therapeutic strategies. Recent data have shown that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in NP tissues in parallel with the progression of IVD degeneration and form a microenvironment of oxidative stress. This study examined whether AGEs accumulation aggravates NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration, and explored the mechanisms underlying these effects. We observed that the viability and proliferation of human NP cells were significantly suppressed by AGEs treatment, mainly due to apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was detected after AGEs treatment. In addition, the molecular data showed that AGEs could significantly aggravate the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and prolonged activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, as well as the increased level of Bax protein and decreased level of Bcl-2 protein in mitochondria. These effects could be reduced by antioxidant (2-(2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl) triphenylphosphonium chloride (MitoTEMPO) and Visomitin (SKQ1). Importantly, we identified that impairment of Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) function and the mitochondrial antioxidant network were vital mechanisms in AGEs-induced oxidative stress and secondary human NP cell apoptosis. Finally, based on findings that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) could restore SIRT3 function and rescue human NP cell apoptosis through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (AMPK-PGC-1α) pathway in vitro, we confirmed its protective effect on AGEs-induced IVD degeneration in vivo. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that SIRT3 protects against AGEs-induced human NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration. Targeting SIRT3 to improve mitochondrial redox homeostasis may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for attenuating AGEs-associated IVD degeneration.'\n",

The number of golf ball-like particles in a particle assembly was increased by increasing the concentration of the depletant, leading to the formation of branched colloidal chains of the golf ball-like particles.

      "Abstract :'Protein functionalized micro-scale patterned structures are developed using a biocompatible polymer PLGA (poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide)) via thin film dewetting and by step-wise chemical conjugations with EDA (ethylenediamine) and anti-EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) antibodies to target the epithelial cell adhesion molecules of cancer cells. The effectiveness of such protein functionalized patterned surface is checked through cell isolation process using blood samples spiked with different cancer cells such as MCF-7, A549, MDA-MB-231. An efficient capture yield of 92% is obtained with MCF-7 cells over a two hour incubation time. The study demonstrates the effects of cell concentration and incubation time on the binding of cancer cells to the modified patterned surfaces. For the first time, a simple and inexpensive method is reported to fabricate functionalized PLGA patterned surface for an efficient isolation of cancer cells from diluted blood samples. The method shows the potential to be used as an effective platform for the development of an improved circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation device from the clinical blood sample.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Bleeding heterogeneity observed in haemophilia A (HA) may attribute to that the available monitoring methods cannot appropriately reflect the coagulation profile. The present study aimed to develop a global approach by changing the clotting initiation way in rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assay. ROTEM was run in Factor VIII (FVIII)-immune-depleted plasma to which different concentrations of recombinant VIII (rFVIII) had been added, and also in 31 patients with HA. The clotting activators were APTT reagent (1.2\\u202f×\\u202f10 of the dose used in the original APTT method) and recombinant tissue factor (0.02\\u202fpmol/L). In FVIII-immune-depleted plasma spiked with rFVIII, maximum velocity of coagulation reliably mirrored the rFVIII levels. This dose-response disappeared after the samples were pre-incubated with an antibody against TFPI, protein S, activated prothrombin complex concentrate or rFVIIa known to favour the extrinsic activation. In the HA patients with FVIII 0-0.21\\u202fIU/mL, APTT and ROTEM outcomes varied in significant correlations to FVIII activity; however, this correlation became non-significant when only samples with FVIII 0-0.05\\u202fIU/mL were included.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The decreased coagulation in HA mostly result from deficiency/absence of FVIII; other pro-/anti-thrombotic proteins are also influential. The multiple effects may cause a mismatch between bleeding phenotype and FVIII concentrations. The ROTEM assay with the clotting activators i.e., tiny doses of APTT reagent and TF are more effective than the original APTT method as regards the assay sensitivity to influence by VIII activity and also to that by other pro-/anti-thrombotic proteins, showing the whole coagulation picture behind the phenotypic heterogeneity in HA.'\n",

During the experiment, the mesophilic reactor was subjected to stepwise temperature increases by 5\\u202f°C. The phenol conversion rates of the AnMBR decreased from 3.16\\u202fat 35\\u202f°C to 2.10\\u202fmgPhgVSSd at 45\\u202f°C, and further decreased to 1.63\\u202fmgPhgVSSd at 50\\u202f°C. At 55\\u202f°C, phenol conversion rate stabilized at 1.53\\u202fmgPhgVSSd whereas COD removal efficiency was 38% compared to 95.5% at 45\\u202f°C and 99.8% at 35\\u202f°C. Interestingly, it was found that the phenol degradation process was less susceptible for the upward temperature shifts than the methanogenic process. The temperature increase implied twenty-one operational taxonomic units from the reactor's microbial community with significant differential abundance between mesophilic and thermophilic operation, and eleven of them are known to be involved in aromatic compounds degradation. Reaching the upper-temperature limits for mesophilic operation was associated with the decrease in microbial abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which are linked to syntrophic phenol degradation. It was also found that the particle size decreased from 89.4\\u202fμm\\u202fat 35\\u202f°C to 21.0\\u202fμm\\u202fat 55\\u202f°C. The accumulation of small particles and higher content of soluble microbial protein-like substances led to increased transmembrane pressure which negatively affected the filtration performance. Our findings indicated that at high salinity a mesophilic AnMBR can tolerate a temperature up to 45\\u202f°C without being limited in the phenol conversion capacity.\"\n",

This technique is capable of capturing the phosphorylated biomolecules through the affinity of the phosphoryl group for metal oxides/hydroxides. Fly-ash (FA), a by-product of coal-combustion power plants, is primarily composed of oxides of silicon and metals, among which iron and titanium. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential of these metal oxides for phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide enrichment. FA is annually produced over hundred million tons worldwide and generally considered as hazardous waste. It is thus of great importance to enhance its utilization. Here we present the first demonstration of the utility of FA as a low-cost MOAC material for the enrichment of phosphoproteins. With an FA-microcolumn, phosphoproteins can be successfully sequestered from other proteins. FA-microcolumns are shown to be simple, cheap and selective devices for phosphoprotein enrichment from a small volume of mixtures.'\n",

Although an SAP diagnosis requires prompt treatment, therapeutic options remain limited. SRT1720 is a newly formulatedSIRT1 activator that exerts multiple pharmacological activities with beneficial health effects. However, its potential as an SAP treatment has not been explored. The current study assessed the effect of SRT1720 on a rat model of sodium taurocholate-induced SAP and explored the underlying mechanism. SAP was induced in rats by retrograde injection of a 3.5% sodium taurocholate solution (1\\u2009ml/kg) in the biliopancreatic duct. SRT1720 (5\\u2009mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally after sodium taurocholate exposure. Serum samples were analysed for inflammatory cytokine levels and select enzymatic activities using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and commercial enzyme activity assay kits, respectively; protein expression levels were evaluated by western blotting; mRNA levels of biomarkers were determined by quantitative real-time PCR; histopathological changes were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry.SRT1720 treatment significantly reduced serum amylase, lipase, pancreatic histological scores, proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) levels, and expression of NF-κB and p65 in sodium taurocholate-induced SAP rats. Importantly, the treatment stimulated SIRT1 and IκBα levels in pancreatic tissue. Our data suggest that SRT1720 protects rats from sodium taurocholate-induced SAP by suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Schizophrenia and major depression are associated with alterations in peripheral inflammatory markers, and anti-inflammatory therapy has been proposed as a promising add-on approach in the pharmacologic treatment of both disorders. Second-generation atypical antipsychotics are currently first-line drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and are also used as augmentation strategies in treatment-resistant major depression. Furthermore, these drugs have been reported to exhibit distinct metabolic side effects and to influence inflammatory processes. In this study, we used ex vivo stimulation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood donors with atypical antipsychotics olanzapine or aripiprazole to examine effects on cytokine production independent from metabolic side effects and disease status. Both olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation decreased mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and resulted in diminished protein concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α in conditioned medium of stimulated PBMC. A multiplex approach revealed additional downregulation of IL-2; MIP-1β and IP-10 secretion. Similarly, olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 resulted in a significant decrease in expression and secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α. Our results suggest that atypical antipsychotics directly influence immune cell function and thereby highlight the importance to factor in potential side effects of drugs routinely used in treatment of schizophrenia and major depression on inflammatory processes when considering anti-inflammatory drug therapy as an additional treatment option.'\n",

It has been reported to play crucial roles in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, cancer development, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of sorcin has been reported to be associated with different cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, etc. Essentially, expression of sorcin has been found to be elevated in cancer cells as compared to normal cells, indicating that it has prominent role in cancer. Moreover, sorcin was found to be the regulator of various proteins that has an association with carcinogenesis including NF-κB, STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, VEGF, MMPs, caspases, etc. Sorcin was also found to regulate apoptosis, as silencing of the same resulted in increased levels of proapoptotic genes and induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cancer. Interestingly, mutations in the sorcin gene have been closely linked with poor overall survival in bladder cancer, brain lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Additionally, overexpression of sorcin was also found to induce MDR against different chemotherapeutic drugs. All these findings mark the importance of sorcin in cancer development and MDR. Therefore, there is urgent need to explore the functional mechanism of sorcin and to analyze whether silencing of sorcin would able to chemosensitize MDR cells. The current review summarizes the structure, expression, and functions of sorcin and its importance in the regulation of various malignancies and MDR.'\n"

To add value to the Thai silk extracts, and hence the silk industry, a simple enrichment process was recently developed and the enriched silk extracts were then applied in nano-cosmeceutical products and nano-delivery systems. In this study, the protective effect of Thai silk extracts from three different strains of Bombyx mori on the drug-induced phototoxicity was evaluated in vitro using chlorpromazine (CPZ), a commonly used antipsychotic drug, as a representative phototoxic drug. The human epidermal A431 cell line and reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) model were used as the in vitro skin model. The silk extracts significantly improved the viability of A431 cells after CPZ exposure and ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, as shown by the significantly increased CPZ and UVA IC values and the decreased proportion of apoptotic cells. The protective effect of these silk extracts against the CPZ-induced UVA-phototoxicity in A431 cells was associated with the attenuation of intracellular oxidative stress via an increased intracellular glutathione level. Likewise, the silk extracts exhibited a protective effect on the CPZ-induced UVA-phototoxicity in the RhE model, in terms of an improved tissue viability and attenuation of the released inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1α. These findings support the potential usefulness of silk extracts in novel applications, especially in the protection of drug-induced phototoxicity.'\n",

While oxidants may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease, evidence continues to emerge that shows these species also play important regulatory roles in health. A major mechanism of oxidant sensing and signaling involves their reaction with reactive cysteine thiols within proteins, inducing oxidative posttranslational modifications that can couple to altered function to enable homeostatic regulation. Protein kinase A and protein kinase G are regulated by oxidants in this way, and this review focuses on our molecular-level understanding of these events and their role in regulating cardiovascular physiology during health and disease.

Unicystic ameloblastoma (UAM) is considered a less aggressive variant of ameloblastoma, amenable to more conservative treatment, and classified as a distinct entity. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutation profile of UAM ( n\\u2009=\\u200939) and to compare it to conventional AM ( n\\u2009=\\u200939). The associations between mutation status and recurrence probability were also analyzed. In the mandible, 94% of UAMs (29/31, including 8/8 luminal, 6/8 intraluminal, and 15/15 mural subtypes) and 74% of AMs (28/38) revealed BRAF V600E mutations. Among the BRAF wild-type cases, 1 UAM showed a missense SMO mutation (p.L412F), whereas 2 NRAS (p.Q61R), 2 HRAS (p.Q61R), and 2 FGFR2 (p.C383R) activating mutations were identified in AM. Of the 3 maxillary UAMs, only 1 revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate high frequency of activating BRAF V600E mutations in both UAM and AM of the mandible. In maxillary UAMs, the BRAF V600E mutation prevalence appears to be lower as was shown for AM previously. It could therefore be argued that UAM and AM are part of the spectrum of the same disease. AMs without BRAF V600E mutations were associated with an increased rate of local recurrence ( P = 0.0003), which might indicate that routine mutation testing also has an impact on prognosis.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Recent findings indicate that a class of disordered amino acid sequences promotes functional phase transition of biomolecules in nature. Such sequences consist of low complexity domains (LCDs) that are rich in specific amino acids. In this work, we exploit these sequences by conjugating them to soluble globular domains to develop molecular adhesives that enable sensitive, controlled self-assembly of these proteins into supramolecular architectures. In particular, we used the enzyme adenylate kinase and the green fluorescent protein as soluble domains, and we show that the addition of low complexity regions induces the formation of protein particles via a multistep process. This multistep pathway involves an initial liquid-liquid phase transition, which creates protein-rich droplets that mature into protein aggregates over time. These protein aggregates consist of permeable structures that maintain activity and release active soluble proteins. We show that the LCDs dictate specific noncovalent intermolecular interactions and phase properties that are largely independent of the given globular domain. We further demonstrate that this feature, together with the dynamic state of the initial dense liquid phase, allows one to directly assemble different globular domains within the same architecture, thereby enabling the generation of both static multifunctional biomaterials and dynamic microscale bioreactors.'\n",

It is estimated that nearly 40% of all marketed pharmaceuticals are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) acting pharmaceuticals. Here, we applied an in-vitro assay, called the TGFα shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of GPCRs-acting pharmaceuticals present in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan from 2014 to 2016. The results indicated that compounds were present in the wastewater with antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (β1), acetylcholine (M1), and histamine (H1) receptors in both countries. The most consistent and powerful antagonistic activity was against the H1, D2, and AT1 receptors at up to microgram-antagonist-equivalent quantity/L. Chemical analysis of the same UK samples was also conducted in parallel. Comparing the results of the bioassay with the chemical analysis indicated (1) the existence of other D2 or M1 receptor antagonists besides sulpiride (D2 antagonist) or pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) in wastewater and (2) that there might be a mixture effect between agonist and antagonistic activities against β1 receptor. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be paid more attention in the environmental monitoring and toxicity testing in future studies.'\n",

The mRNA levels of several antioxidant enzymes [heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), catalase (Cat), superoxide dismutase (Sod), and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx)] were identified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ho-1 and Nqo1 protein levels were evaluated using Western blotting. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) of the nuclear fraction was also quantified using Western blotting. Catalase activity and glutathione (GSH) contents were determined by colorimetric assay kits. Nrf2 promoter-luciferase activity was evaluated by a dual luciferase assay system.\\n\\nRESULTS: Treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) decreased cell viability dose-dependently. DHA or EPA pretreatment significantly alleviated tBHP-induced cytotoxicity. DHA or EPA increased the mRNA levels of Ho-1, Nqo1, and Cat dose-dependently. Ho-1 protein level, catalase activity, Nrf2 promoter-luciferase activity, and intracellular GSH contents were significantly increased by DHA and EPA.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DHA and EPA can induce Ho-1 and catalase via Nrf2, thus protecting Schwann cells against oxidative stress. ω-3 PUFAs appear to exert their neuroprotective effect by increasing defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in diabetic neuropathies.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) do not autonomously fold up into a unique stable conformation and remain as an ensemble of rapidly fluctuating conformers. Many IDPs are prone to convert into the β-rich amyloid-state. One such amyloidogenic IDP is α-synuclein that is involved in Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have indicated that other neuronal proteins, especially IDPs, can co-aggregate with α-synuclein in many pathological ailments. This article describes several such observations highlighting the role of heterotypic protein-protein interactions in the formation of hetero-amyloids.

To this end, MaSS-Simulator has been presented, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to simulate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers many configuration options to allow the user a great degree of control over the test datasets, which can enable rigorous and large- scale testing of any proteomics algorithm. MaSS-Simulator is assessed by comparing its performance against experimentally generated spectra and spectra obtained from NIST collections of spectral library. The results show that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra match closely with real-spectra and have a relative-error distribution centered around 25%. In contrast, the theoretical spectra for same peptides have relative-error distribution centered around 150%.

Reliable biomarkers might be identified by investigating biological fluids of the species of interest, but protein sequence databases are often incomplete and human-specific devices for reducing sample complexity might fail when applied to animal plasma. Here, seven commercial methods based on different capturing agents (anti-human antibodies, affinity ligands, mixture of antibodies and ligands, and combinatorial peptide ligand libraries) were applied to cat plasma and evaluated in terms of yield, identified proteins/ peptides, and relative abundance by high resolution shotgun proteomics and label-free quantitation. As a result, anti-human antibody-based methods were unsatisfactory. Most failed in reducing albumin and immunoglobulins, and some led to a substantial removal of other highly abundant proteins, probably because of nonspecific interactions. A protein A/dye ligand-based method was efficient in reducing immunoglobulins, fibrinogen and apolipoprotein A1 and A2, but not albumin, and protein identifications did not increase. Only peptide ligand libraries flattened the dynamic range, and increased protein identification (59.0%). Albumin and immunoglobulins were successfully depleted (60.7% and 35.9%, respectively). Although further studies will be required for reinforcing our observations, this work can provide a useful guide for cat plasma pretreatment in biomarker discovery studies.

      "Abstract :'In this study, chitosan/bioactive glass (BG)/lawsone coatings were deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on polyetheretherketone (PEEK)/BG layers (previously deposited by EPD on 316-L stainless steel) to produce bioactive and antibacterial coatings. First, the EPD of chitosan/BG/lawsone was optimized on stainless steel in terms of suspension stability, homogeneity and thickness of coatings. Subsequently, the optimized EPD parameters were used to produce bioresorbable chitosan/bioactive glass (BG)/lawsone coatings on PEEK/BG layers. The produced layered coatings were characterized in terms of composition, microstructure, corrosion resistance, in vitro bioactivity, drug release kinetics and antibacterial activity. Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopic analyses confirmed the release of lawsone from the coatings. Moreover, the deposition of chitosan/BG coatings was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The coated specimens presented higher corrosion resistance (10 times) in comparison to that of bare 316-L stainless steel and showed convenient wettability for initial protein attachment. The presence of lawsone in the top layer provided antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus carnosus. Moreover, the developed coatings formed apatite-like crystals upon immersion in simulated body fluid, indicating the possibility of achieving close interaction between the coating surface and bone. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "Abstract :'Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family and is able to act cardioprotective. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of IL-33 by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and bisphosphonates (BPs) in human cardiac tissue. The lipophilic fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin as well as the nitrogenous BPs alendronate and ibandronate, but not hydrophilic pravastatin increased IL-33 mRNA and intracellular IL-33 protein levels in both human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) and fibroblasts (HACF). Additionally, fluvastatin reduced soluble ST2 secretion from HACM. IL-33 was also up-regulated by the general inhibitor of prenylation perillic acid, a RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and by latrunculin B, but statin-induced IL-33 expression was inhibited by mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and RhoA activator U-46619. The IL-33 promoter was 2.3-fold more accessible in statin-treated HACM compared to untreated cells (P\\xa0=\\xa00.037). In explanted hearts of statin-treated patients IL-33 protein was up-regulated as compared with the hearts of non-statin-treated patients (P\\xa0=\\xa00.048). As IL-33 was previously shown to exert cardioprotective effects, one could speculate that such up-regulation of IL-33 expression in human cardiac cells, which might happen mainly through protein geranylgeranylation, could be a novel mechanism contributing to known cardioprotective effects of statins and BPs.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Warsaw breakage syndrome (WBS) is a recently recognized DDX11-related rare cohesinopathy, characterized by severe prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, microcephaly, developmental delay, cochlear anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss. Only seven cases have been reported in the English literature, and thus the information on the phenotype and genotype of this interesting condition is limited. We provide clinical and molecular information on five additional unrelated patients carrying novel bi-allelic variants in the DDX11 gene, identified via whole exome sequencing. One of the variants was found to be a novel Saudi founder variant. All identified variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic except for one that was initially classified as a variant of unknown significance (VOUS) (p.Arg378Pro). Functional characterization of this VOUS using heterologous expression of wild type and mutant DDX11 revealed a marked effect on protein stability, thus confirming pathogenicity of this variant. The phenotypic data of the seven WBS reported patients were compared to our patients for further phenotypic delineation. Although all the reported patients had cochlear hypoplasia, one patient also had posterior labyrinthine anomaly. We conclude that while the cardinal clinical features in WBS (microcephaly, growth retardation, and cochlear anomalies) are almost universally present, the breakage phenotype is highly variable and can be absent in some cases. This report further expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and molecular features of WBS.'\n",

Pharmorubicin is a cytotoxic drug, widely used in the treatment of breast cancer, but its role is limited because of chemoresistance produced by cells. This study focused on exploring the influence of autophagy on the resistance of pharmorubicin in breast cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: The cell survival of breast cancer cells was detected by MTT. The mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was tested by qRT-PCR. The protein expression of HO-1, autophagic proteins (LC3-I,LC3-II and Beclin-1), PI3K and Akt was detected by Western blot. Cell autophagy was examined by Cyto-ID Autophagy Detection Kit.\\n\\nRESULTS: After being treated with pharmorubicin, the expression of HO-1 and autophagy related proteins was significantly enhanced, but the cell survival ratio in the two cell lines decreased. After autophagy was inhibited, HO-1 expression in two cells was down-regulated. When pharmorubicin-resistant cells were transfected with si-HO-1, the cell survival decreased and the protein expression of HO-1, autophagic proteins (LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1) as well as autophagy were all down-regulated, while in pharmorubicin-resistant cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-HO-1, the results were reverse. When the PI3K or Akt was inhibited, PI3K, p-Akt, HO-1, autophagic proteins and autophagy were decreased remarkably.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: It was proved that HO-1 induction mediated chemoresistance of pharmorubicin in breast cancer cells by promoting autophagy via PI3K/Akt pathway.'\n",

      "Abstract :'We describe a set of proteins in which a βγ-crystallin domain pairs with an Ig-like domain, and which are confined to microbes, like bacteria, slime molds, and fungi. DdCAD-1 (Ca -dependent cell adhesion molecule-1) and APP (Abundant Perithecial Protein) represent this class of molecules. Using the crystal structure of APP-NTD (N-terminal domain of APP), we describe its mode of Ca binding and provide a generalized theme for correct identification of the Ca -binding site within this class of molecules. As a common feature, one of the two Ca -binding sites is non-functional in the βγ-crystallin domains of these proteins. While APP-NTD binds Ca with a micromolar affinity which is comparable to DdCAD-1, APP surprisingly does not bind Ca . Crystal structures of APP and Ca -bound APP-NTD reveal that the interface interactions\\xa0in APP render\\xa0its Ca -binding site inoperative. Thus, heterodomain association provides a novel mode of Ca binding regulation in APP. Breaking the interface interactions (mutating Asp30Ala, Leu132Ala, and Ile135Ala) or separation from the Ig-like domain removes the constraints upon the required conformational transition\\xa0and enables the βγ-crystallin domain to bind Ca . In mechanistic detail, our work demonstrates an interdomain interface adapted to distinct functional niches in APP and its homolog DdCAD-1. This article is protected by copyright.

Changing from an agricultural to an industrial society may affect family roles and child-care practices. The present study aims to reveal family attitudes, knowledge and practices focusing on complementary feeding (CF).\\n\\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Child Health Clinics in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Self-administered questionnaires were given to families caring for healthy infants and children less than 18\\u2009months of age during October to November 2016.\\n\\nRESULTS: One-hundred and eight respondents completed questionnaires. The study found different attitudes and knowledge gaps between the respondents who were mothers and other family members ('others'). The 'others' were less likely to value CF as a crucial factor promoting child growth and development. Moreover, they had misperceptions about the benefits of animal-based protein and were less confident in their ability to feed the child properly. Most families reported timely introduction of complementary food, using proper milk products and encouraging age-appropriate feeding methods. However, there were undesirable practices including delaying introduction of animal-based protein, inadequate food diversity, the use of seasoning, feeding premasticated food and offering food as a reward.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that nutritional education should be extended to all caregivers involved in CF to improve the adherence to feeding recommendations.\"\n",

Analysis of bone-regulatory markers in follicles from 12 different study participants was performed using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence; apical and coronal segments from each dental follicle were processed independently. Four additional dental follicles were used for cell cultures; HDFCs were precultured in osteogenic medium to initiate differentiation and thereafter cultured with 10 M forskolin (FSK) to activate the protein kinase cAMP (PKA/cAMP) signalling pathway and induce RANKL/OPG expression. We demonstrate that RANKL expression is significantly higher in the coronal part of follicles than in the apical part. High levels of collagen type 1 (COL1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Gap-junction protein, alpha 1, 43 kDa (CX43) were expressed, whereas expression of Sp7 transcription factor (OSX), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP1), and OPG was low in all samples. The immunofluorescence localization of CSF-1, MCP1, osteocalcin (OCN), RANKL, and BMP2 was not specific for either part of the follicles. In conclusion, a consistently high expression of CX43 suggests that gap-junction communication in HDFCs is essential for the eruption process. Furthermore, the induced expression of RANKL in HDFCs varies significantly between individuals and may relate to clinical variations in tooth eruption.'\n",

We have synthesized nanoarrays of small pharmacophores on DNA origami substrates that are displayed either as individual ligands or as fragment pairs and thereby reduced the feature size by several orders of magnitude, as compared with standard microarray techniques. Atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule detection allowed us to distinguish potent protein-ligand interactions from weak binders. Several independent binding events, i.e., strong binding, weak binding, symmetric bidentate binding, and asymmetric bidentate binding are directly visualized and evaluated. We apply this method to the discovery of bidentate trypsin binders based on benzamidine paired with aromatic fragments. Pairing of benzamidine with the dye TAMRA results in tenfold enhancement of the trypsin binding yield.'\n",

Key to an efficient selection of novel binders to biomacromolecules is a robust method to link their genotype and phenotype. We have developed a novel bacterial cell surface display technology to present cyclic peptides composed of a synthetic and a genetically encoded fragment in their backbones. The fragments were combined by protein trans-splicing and an intramolecular oxime ligation. To this end, a split intein half and an unnatural amino acid were displayed with the genetically encoded part on the surface of E. coli. Addition of the synthetic fragment equipped with the split intein partner and an aminooxy moiety as well as the application of a pH-shift protocol resulted in the on-surface formation of the semi-synthetic cyclic peptide. Our approach will serve for the generation of cyclic peptide libraries suitable for selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and more generally enables chemical modification of proteins on the bacterial surface.'\n",

This study aimed to evaluate calcitonin effects on endometrial receptivity. To this end, the effects of calcitonin on the implantation window in the ovarian stimulation and the normal ovarian cycle were investigated by the morphological study of the endometrium as well as the expression of MSX.1, HB-EGF and miRNA Let-7a; then the mechanisms of calcitonin effects were studied through mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 Bulb/c mice were divided into two groups: Normal ovarian cycle and ovarian stimulation. Each group consisted of 4 subgroups: Ctrl, CT, PP242, and CT+PP242. Calcitonin and PP242 were injected on the 4th of pregnancy and 24 hours later all the mice were sacrificed. Uterine tissue samples were used for morphological analysis and the endometrial epithelial and the stromal cells were isolated from myometrium for evaluation of gene and protein expression.\\n\\nRESULTS: Ovarian stimulation increased the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and ERK1/2 and the expression of miRNA let-7a. Calcitonin injection increased the expression of HB-EGF, Msx.1, and miRNA Let-7a in a normal ovarian cycle and in ovarian-stimulated mice.

Interaction with KaiC2 and KaiC3 proteins was not detected, suggesting different signal transduction components for the clock homologs. Inactivation of rpaA in Synechocystis sp. PCC\\xa06803 leads to reduced viability of the mutant in light-dark cycles, especially under mixotrophic growth conditions. Chemoheterotrophic growth of the ∆rpaA strain in the dark was abolished completely. Transcriptomic data revealed that RpaA is mainly involved in the regulation of genes related to CO -acclimation in the light and to carbon metabolism in the dark.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive cortical regions with hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images, and these regions showed swelling in T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The medial occipital cortex and striatum showed no apparent hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Mild myoclonus was detected, and the patient died 10\\u2009months after the onset of symptoms; she did not enter the akinetic mutism state. The patient's brain weighed 1050\\u2009g, and neuropathological examination showed extensive characteristic various-sized and non-confluent (VaSNoC) vacuoles in the cerebral cortex. These vacuoles were observable macroscopically by loupe on images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue. Gliosis, hypertrophic astrocytosis, and neuron loss were generally mild in character. Prion protein (PrP) immunostaining showed very mild diffuse-synaptic-type PrP deposition in the cerebral gray matter. These clinicopathological findings led us to several conclusions relative to the early disease pathology of V180I genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: (i) spongiform change was not found in the medial occipital cortex, which corresponds to the results of DWI; (ii) VaSNoC-type spongiform changes, extensively recognized in the cerebral cortex, corresponded to the DWI findings showing continued hyperintensity with higher brightness, and T2-weighted and FLAIR images findings showing a swelling; and (iii) spongiform changes first appear in the deeper layer and subsequently in the superficial layer in the cerebral cortex.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Deregulated proteolysis invariably underlies most human diseases including bone pathologies. Metalloproteinases constitute the largest of the five protease families, and the metzincin metalloproteinases are inhibited by the four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase called TIMPs. We hypothesized that Timp genes are essential for skeletal homeostasis. We bred individual Timp knockout mice to generate unique mouse models, the quadruple Timp null strain (QT) as well as mice harboring only a single Timp3 allele (QT3 ). QT mice are grossly smaller and exhibit a dramatic reduction of trabeculae in long bones by µCT imaging with a corresponding increase in metalloproteinase activity. At the cellular level, Timp deficiency compromised differentiation markers, matrix deposition and mineralization in neonatal osteoblasts from calvariae, as well as the CFU-F capacity of bone marrow derived stromal cells. In contrast, we observed that osteoclasts were overactive in the Timp null state, consistent with the noted excessive bone resorption of QT bones. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses of bone sections revealed higher Cathepsin K and RANKL signals upon Timp loss. Seeking the molecular mechanism, we identified abnormal TNFα bioactivity to be a central event in Timp deficient mice. Specifically, TNFα triggered induction of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk1 in the osteoblasts at the mRNA and protein levels, with a simultaneous increase in RANKL. Neutralizing TNFα antibody was capable of rescuing the induction of Dkk1 as well as RANKL. Therefore, the generation of novel Timp deficient systems allowed us to uncover the essential and collective function of TIMP proteins in mammalian long bone homeostasis. Moreover, our study discovers a functional TIMP/metalloproteinase-TNFα-Dkk1/RANKL nexus for optimal control of the bone microenvironment which dictates co-existence of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important biological process involving the process by which malignant tumor cells obtain the ability of migration, invasion, resistance of apoptosis, and degradation in the extracellular matrix. The current study aimed at investigating whether bone marrow X kinase Rho GTPase activating protein 12 (BMX-ARHGAP) fusion gene affects GC. First, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against BMX-ARHGAP or BMX-ARHGAP were introduced to treat SGC-7901 cells with the highest BMX-ARHGAP among the five GC cell lines (SGC-7901, MKN-45, NCI-N87, SNU-5, and AGS). Next, cell vitality, drug resistance, migration, and invasion of SGC-7901 cells, activities of Rho and JAK/STAT axis, as well as EMT and lymph node metastasis (LNM) were evaluated. The survival rate of the mice was then determined through the transfection of the specific pathogen-free NOD-SCID mice with treated SGC-7901 cells. The results showed that BMX-ARHGAP expression was associated with the infiltration degree of GC tumor and poor prognosis for patients with GC. BMX-ARHGAP silencing was found to play an inhibitory role in the Rho and JAK/STAT axis to reduce cell vitality, drug resistance, migration and invasion, reverse EMT process, as well as inhibit LNM. BMX-ARHGAP overexpression was observed to have induced effects on GC cells as opposed to those inhibited by BMX-ARHGAP silencing. The survival rate of mice was increased after transfection with silenced BMX-ARHGAP. These findings provided evidence that the suppression of BMX-ARHGAP resulted in the inhibition of RhoA to restraint the development of GC cells by blocking the JAK/STAT axis.'\n",

However, the expression and roles of RPL34 in human glioma remain largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the expression and role of RPL34 in glioma. We report here that RPL34 is highly expressed in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of RPL34 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as prevented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in glioma cells. Further, mechanistic analysis showed that knockdown of RPL34 significantly downregulated the levels of p-JAK and p-STAT3 in glioma cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that knockdown of RPL34 inhibits the proliferation and migration of glioma cells through the inactivation of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, RPL34 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.'\n",

Functionally, overexpression of miR-542-5p improves ALI in mice with SAP via inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway by binding to PAK1.Based on the evidence from experimental models, miR-542-5p was shown to improve ALI among mice with SAP, while suggesting that the effect may be related to the inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway and downregulation of PAK1 gene. Thus, miR-542-5p could serve as a promising target for ALI treatment.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are used to internalize different cargoes, including DNA, into live mammalian and plant cells. Despite many cells being easily transfected with this approach, other cells are rather \"difficult\" or \"hard to transfect,\" including protist cells of the genus Leishmania. Based on our previous results in successfully internalizing proteins into Leishmania tarentolae cells, we used single CPPs and three different DNA-binding proteins to form protein-like complexes with plasmids covered with CPPs. We attempted magnetofection, electroporation, and transfection using a number of commercially available detergents. While complex formation with negatively charged DNA required substantially higher amounts of CPPs than those necessary for mostly neutral proteins, the cytotoxicity of the required amounts of CPPs and auxiliaries was thoroughly studied. We found that Leishmania cells were indeed susceptible to high concentrations of some CPPs and auxiliaries, although in a different manner compared with that for mammalian cells. The lack of successful transfections implies the necessity to accept certain general limitations regarding DNA internalization into difficult-to-transfect cells. Only electroporation allowed reproducible internalization of large and rigid plasmid DNA molecules through electrically disturbed extended membrane areas, known as permeable membrane macrodomains.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Recent studies have shown that microRNA (miRNAs) can play important roles in the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) function. However, the expression profile of miRNAs and their effects on the apoptosis of ECs under microgravity conditions remains unclear. In this study, the apoptosis of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) under simulated microgravity was identified by Annexin V and propidium iodide double staining and transmission electron microscopy. miRNA microarray assay was used to screen the differentially expressed miRNAs in HPMECs under simulated microgravity, and eight differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Specifically, miR-503-5p, which was found to be most significantly upregulated in both microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays, was selected for further functional investigation. Overexpression of miR-503-5p induced apoptosis of HPMECs under normal gravity and aggravated the negative effects of simulated microgravity on HPMECs. Furthermore, silencing of miR-503-5p expression effectively attenuated the negative effects of simulated microgravity on HPMECs. Further experiments showed that the mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), which has been confirmed as a direct target of miR-503-5p, was inhibited by the upregulation of miR-503-5p and increased by the downregulation of miR-503-5p. Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that miR-503-5p can induce apoptosis of HPMECs under simulated microgravity through, at least in part, inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma (GBM), identified as one of four clinically relevant molecular subtypes, has worst prognosis because of its close relation with the malignant biological properties induced by glial-mesenchymal transition (GMT). However, the molecular mechanism of GMT and its characterized molecule of GBM have not been studied. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is at a convergence point of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling as one of the three core pathways implicated in GBM. Our previous study indicated that the inactivation of FOXO1 involved in the inhibition of GMT is an independent prognosis factor of GBM. In this study, we will further confirm the role of FOXO1 in GMT through cytological experiments to clarify how FOXO1 regulates GMT and its clinical significance. We established virus-infected FOXO1 overexpression and FOXO1 knockdown cells of U373 MG and U251 mediated by lentivirus, based on the effect of which FOXO1-correlated-GMT experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggested that FOXO1 played a crucial role in resistance to TMZ, BCNU, and CDDP; migration and invasion; and stem cell properties of glioma cells. FOXO1 may serve as a targeted biomarker for prediction of sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs, metastasis, and prognosis, which provides a new idea for mesenchymal GBM treatment.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Chemotherapy drug resistance frequently happens in more than 50% of bladder cancer patients and is the major obstacle for the bladder cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is involved in the development of chemoresistance. In this study, we reported hypoxia inducible factor 1α-antisense RNA 2 (HIF1A-AS2), as a subtype-specific hypoxia inducible lncRNA, is upregulated in bladder cancer cells and tissue after cisplatin (Cis) treatment. The induction of HIF1A-AS2 in bladder cancer cells rendered resistance to Cis-induced apoptosis. Silencing HIF1A-AS2 in Cis-resistant bladder cancer cells was re-sensitized to Cis-induced apoptosis. Mechanically, we found that HIF1A-AS2 suppressed the transcription activity of p53 family proteins by promoting the expression of high-mobility group A1\\xa0(HMGA1). The induction of HMGA1 physically interacts with p53, p63, and p73, and therefore constrains their transcriptional activity on Bax. Knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 or HMGA1 rescued the expression of Bax, which therefore enhanced the killing effect of Cis. Furthermore, we also found that the expression of HIF1A-AS2 was higher in the human bladder tumor tissues after Cis treatment, and was positive correlated to the expression of HIF1α and HMGA1. This study suggests that upregulated HIF1A-AS2 hampers the p53 family proteins dependent apoptotic pathway to promote Cis resistance in bladder cancer. Our data suggested that HIF1A-AS2 plays oncogenic roles and can be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Detection of proteins which may be potential biomarkers of disorders represents a big step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie pathological processes. In this context proteomics plays the important role of opening a path for the identification of molecular signatures that can potentially assist in early diagnosis of several clinical disturbances. Aim of this report is to provide an overview of the wide variety of proteomic strategies that have been applied to the investigation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a severe disorder that causes an irreversible damage to the lungs and for which there is no cure yet. The results in this area published over the past decade show that proteomics indeed has the ability of monitoring alterations in expression profiles of proteins from fluids/tissues of patients affected by COPD and healthy controls. However, these data also suggest that proteomics, while being an attractive tool for the identification of novel pathological mediators of COPD, remains a technique mainly generated and developed in research laboratories. Great efforts dedicated to the validation of these biological signatures will result in the proof of their clinical utility. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'\n",

Here, we explored the actions of signaling pathways, including the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways, on RN IL-1β-mediated pain modulation. After a single dose of recombinant rat IL-1β (rrIL-1β, 10\\xa0ng) injected into the RN in normal rats, a tactile allodynia was evoked in the contralateral but not ipsilateral hindpaw, commencing 75\\xa0min and peaking 120\\xa0min postinjection. Up-regulated protein levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and p-JNK were observed in the RN 120\\xa0min after rrIL-1β injection, the increases of p-STAT3 and p-JNK were blocked by anti-IL-1β antibody. However, the expression levels of p-ERK, p-p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in the RN were not affected by rrIL-1β injection. RN neurons and astrocytes contributed to IL-1β-evoked up-regulation of p-STAT3 and p-JNK. Further studies demonstrated that injection of the JAK2 antagonist AG490 or JNK antagonist SP600125 into the RN 30\\xa0min prior to the administration of rrIL-1β could completely prevent IL-1β-evoked tactile allodynia, while injection of the ERK antagonist PD98059, p38 MAPK antagonist SB203580, or NF-κB antagonist PDTC did not affect IL-1β-evoked tactile allodynia. In conclusion, our data provide additional evidence that RN IL-1β is involved in pain modulation, and that it exerts a facilitatory effect by activating the JAK/STAT3 and JNK signaling pathways.'\n",

The aim of our study is to investigate the expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132) and its effect on cardiocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis by binding to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) through the phosphateidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (Akt) signal transduction pathway in DCM rats. DCM rat models induced by doxorubicin were established and confirmed by an ultrasonic cardiogram. Epithelial cells were treated with inhibitors, activators, and small interfering RNAs to identify the mechanisms by which miR-132 controls cardiocyte activity and cardiac fibrosis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone (ALD) expressions were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between PTEN and miR-132 was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested by the MTT assay and flow cytometry. PTEN was determined to be the target gene of miR-132. Rat models of DCM exhibited a lower level of miR-132, PI3K, Akt, B-cell lymphoma 2, collagen I, and collagen III, but a higher level of PTEN, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as inflammatory response (Ang II and ALD), accompanied by declined cardiocyte proliferation and elevated apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Upregulated miR-132 or silenced PTEN activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus facilitating cardiocyte proliferation and repressing cardiocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, as well as inflammatory responses. Downregulated miR-132 reversed this tendency. These findings indicate that miR-132 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway by inhibiting PTEN expression, thus facilitating cardiocyte proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis in DCM rats.'\n",

A total of 174 patients, including 117 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 57 patients with benign pulmonary lesions (BPL), were enrolled. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the expression of E2, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1) in patients with NSCLC and BPL to analyze the correlation between E2 and CEA, NSE or CYFRA21-1 expression, and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression of tumor markers was then examined in different lung cancer cells (A549, H1795, H460, and SK-MES-1). The expression of tumor markers was detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expressions of p-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis. The expression levels of E2, CEA, NSE, and CYFRA21-1 in patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than those in patients with BPL ( P\\u2009<\\u2009.05); E2 was positively correlated with tumor markers ( P\\u2009<\\u2009.01).

The microfluidic device comprises microreactors packed with C18 and TiO particles for on-chip solid phase extraction (SPE) and phosphopeptide enrichment, and an ESI interface for facilitating multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-mass spectrometry (MS) detection. The chips are demonstrated for the detection of three phosphopeptides involved in ERBB2/MAPK signaling pathways, selected from the outcome of a proteomic study involving EGF stimulation of SKBR3/HER2+ breast cancer cells.

This study investigated the relationship of SND1 protein expression both with metastasis and the prognoses of 144 breast cancer patients over a 10-year follow-up. Chi-square tests revealed that the percentages of positive SND1 expression in breast cancer tumors were significantly associated with larger tumor size (>2\\xa0cm, P = 0.043), higher clinical TNM stage (P = 0.003), and positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001).

Multiple Cox regression analysis indicated that SND1 expression is an independent risk factor for shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.97, P = 0.014). The percentages of SND1 expression in metastatic breast cancers were significantly higher than that in primary tumors in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer (P = 0.016).

      "Abstract :'Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox L.) is an important ornamental plant in China with a pleasant floral scent. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying differences in the fragrances among genotypes of this plant, we analyzed floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from two different genotypes: SW001, which has little to no fragrance, and the scented genotype H29. The major VOCs in H29 were linalool, trans-β-ocimene, benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate, benzyl alcohol, and methyl benzoate. The most important aroma-active compound in H29, linalool, was emitted at a low concentration in SW001, which had markedly higher levels of trans-β-ocimene than H29. Next, to investigate scent biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome of fully open flowers of the two genotypes. A total of 14 443 differentially expressed unigenes and 196 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Further analyses indicated that 56 differentially expressed genes involved in the terpenoid and benzenoid biosynthesis pathways might play critical roles in regulating floral fragrance difference. Disequilibrium expression of four terpene synthase genes resulted in diverse emission of linalool and trans-β-ocimene in both genotypes. In addition, the expressions of two CpMYC2 transcription factors were both upregulated in H29, implying that they may regulate linalool production. Notably, 16 of 20 genes in the benzenoid biosynthesis pathway were downregulated, corresponding to the relatively low level of benzenoid production in SW001. The lack of benzyl acetate might indicate that SW001 may lack substrate benzyl alcohol or functional acetyl-CoA: benzylalcohol acetyltransferase. This article is protected by copyright.

      "Abstract :'The pathogenic role of IL-17 and GM-CSF has been unravelled in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in most models, EAE is characterised by a monophasic attack which is not representative of the relapsing nature nor the chronicity displayed in MS. Here, we used proteolipid protein peptide (PLP ) to trigger EAE-relapses (EAE-II) in SJL mice that had recovered from a primary-EAE episode (EAE-I). This procedure resulted in severe and irreversible disease that, unlike EAE-I, was not abolished by anti-IL-17-mAb. In contrast, prophylactic anti-GM-CSF-mAb treatment prevented EAE-I and -II. Strikingly, the expression of T-cell transcription factors and cytokines/chemokines in mice treated with anti-GM-CSF during both EAE episodes was silenced. Anti-GM-CSF-mAb treatment administered only during EAE-II did not completely prevent relapses but mice ultimately reached full recovery. Anti-GM-CSF treatment also strongly impaired and ultimately resolved monophasic MOG -induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. In such protected mice, anti-GM-CSF treatment also prevented a further relapse induced by MOG-revaccination. These results underscore the critical role of GM-CSF on pro-inflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, we observed a strong preventive and curative effect of anti-GM-CSF neutralisation in two EAE models, relapsing and chronic. Altogether these findings are relevant for further MS research.'\n",

Further, cut off values needed to be defined for HE4 and ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women prior to introduction into clinical practice. A tertiary objective was to investigate the correlation between HE4 levels in serum and urine.\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Women with pelvic mass scheduled for surgery were recruited from nine hospitals in southeast Sweden. Preoperative blood samples were taken for analysis of CA125 and HE4 as well as urine samples for analysis of HE4.\\n\\nRESULTS: We enrolled a total of 901 patients out of which 784 were evaluable. In the pre- and postmenopausal groups, no significant differences were found for sensitivity, PPV and NPV neither for RMI vs ROMA nor for CA125 vs HE4 using a fixed specificity of 75%.

We used S. aureus biofilm-prevention assays to determine bacterial biomass in the presence of SPLUNC1 and SPLUNC1Δα4 recombinant proteins, or SPLUNC1-derived peptides (α4 and α4M1), using the well-established crystal-violet biofilm detection assay. The SPLUNC1Δα4 showed markedly reduced biofilm prevention compared to the parent protein. Surprisingly, the 30-residue long α4 motif alone demonstrated minimal biofilm prevention activities. However, structural optimization of the α4 motif resulted in a modified peptide (α4M1) with significantly enhanced antibiofilm properties against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus, including six different clinical strains of MRSA and the well-known USA300.

We additionally examined cell survival in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP under severe hypoxic (0.1% O2) and normoxic (20% O2) conditions. qRT-PCR showed higher up-regulation of PKM2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells than in PC3 cells, while western blotting showed that PKM2 protein levels were up-regulated only in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-2α by small interfering RNA (si-RNA) demonstrated HIF-1α dependent up-regulation of PKM2 at the mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells. PKM2 inhibition by si-RNA significantly decreased hypoxia-response element (HRE) activation in a gene reporter assay and down-regulated HIF-1α target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in PC3 cells, whereas HIF-1α protein levels were not significantly reduced. Additionally, PKM2 inhibition significantly reduced clonogenic survival in both cell lines in a colony formation assay. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) mRNA expression was up-regulated in both cell lines. It has been shown that PKM2 expression is regulated by HIF-1α and that PKM2 favors HIF-1α transactivation under mild (1% O2) but not severe (0.1% O2) hypoxic conditions, and some of our findings are consistent with these previous results. However, this mechanism was not fully observed in our studied cell lines, as PKM2 regulation and HIF-1α stabilization at the transactivation level occurred under severe hypoxic conditions. This discrepancy suggests that tumor tissue origin and cell type influence this model. Our findings expand the current knowledge of the mechanisms of PCA regulation, and would be important in developing novel therapeutic strategies.'\n",

Ex vivo, cholesterol efflux and uptake were determined in hepatic and adipose tissues.\\n\\nRESULTS: Ob/ob mice had more labelled cholesterol in their plasma (86%, p<0.001), suggesting impaired RCT. SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux was elevated from ob/ob mice (serum, 33%; apoB-depleted plasma, 14%, p<0.01) and HDL-c were also higher (60%, p<0.01). Ex vivo it was found that cholesterol uptake was significantly lower into the livers and adipose tissue of ob/ob mice, compared to non-obese wildtype controls. Furthermore, ex vivo cholesterol efflux was reduced in ob/ob liver and adipose tissue towards apoA-I and HDL. Consistent with this, protein levels of SR-BI and ABCG1 were significantly lower in ob/ob hepatic and adipose tissue than in wildtype mice. Finally, labelled cholesterol concentrations were lower in ob/ob bile (67%, p<0.01) and faeces (76%, p<0.0001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Obesity causes impairment in RCT due to reduced plasma cholesterol uptake and efflux by hepatocytes and adipocytes.

In this study, a Bt cotton variety, GK19, and its nontransgenic parent variety, Simian-3, were used as experimental models for investigating the effect of the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on the feeding behavior and nutritional parameters of Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in GK19 was significantly inhibited under NaCl stress. However, the feeding, crawling, resting and spinning down behavior of the 5th instar H. armigera larvae on GK19 Bt cotton, as well as the amount of food consumed and feces produced by these larvae, did not markedly differ under different NaCl concentrations. In contrast, the mean relative growth rate (MRGR), relative growth rate (RGR), approximate digestibility (AD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) of the larvae markedly decreased in response to NaCl stress. Under the same concentration of NaCl, the nutritional parameters of the bollworm larvae on GK19 Bt cotton or Simian-3 nontransgenic cotton were different. However, the interaction between salt stress and cotton variety had no significant effect on the feeding behavior or nutritional parameters of H. armigera larvae. These results may provide a scientific basis for determining the effect of exogenous insecticidal protein expression in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on H. armigera and can therefore be useful for the effective application of Bt cotton in saline-alkali soils to prevent and control H. armigera.'\n",

Thus, disruption of the MDM2-TP53 interaction should attenuate human pterygium cell growth. For primary pterygium, treatment is relatively straightforward and involves surgical excision. To minimize the risk of recurrence, many adjunctive therapies are adopted, including antimetabolites, such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil, amniotic membrane, different variations on conjunctival and/or limbal conjunctival grafts, and other medications such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. In the future, MDM2 antagonists may help further lower the recurrence rates after the treatment of pterygium.'\n",

      "Abstract :'OBJECTIVE: Zhike-Houpu herbal pair (ZKHPHP) is a well-known Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal motility dysfunction. Recently, many researchers have found that some of the compounds of ZKHPHP such as meranzin hydrate and magnolol have antidepressant effects. However, little is known about the antidepressant mechanism of ZKHPHP. Therefore, the main aim of the study is to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of ZKHPHP and its possible mechanism of action on HTR1A (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A) in the hippocampus CA1 region in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress.\\n\\nMETHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into six groups: Normal, Model, ZKHPHP(3g/kg), ZKHPHP(10g/kg), ZKHPHP(20g/kg) and ZKHPHP(30g/kg); N=8 per group. We exposed the rats to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and then assessed antidepressant-like effects of ZKHPHP by measuring weight change, observing the open-field test and measuring sucrose water consumption. The antidepressant mechanism was examined by measuring the effect of ZKHPHP on HTR1A protein expression and HTR1A mRNA expression in the hippocampus CA1 region by using immunohistochemistry analysis, western blotting, and Real-time RT-PCR.\\n\\nRESULTS: ZKHPHP (10 or 20g/kg) reduced the incidence of depressive-like behaviors and increased HTR1A protein and HTR1A mRNA expression in the hippocampus CA1 in rats displaying depressive behavior, while ZKHPHP (3 or 30g/kg) had no obvious effect on the measured depression indicators.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that ZKHPHP has antidepressant-like effects based on a CUMS-induced depression model in rats. ZKHPHP may be attractive as an antidepressant because of its beneficial effects on depression and the absence of gastrointestinal dysregulation, which is a frequently observed unintended effect of many commonly used antidepressive medications.'\n"

Focus groups and interviews were used to explore all reasons for consuming and not consuming eggs in older adults. Forty-two individuals (20 males, 22 females, aged 56-96\\u2009years) took part in one of eight focus groups or two individual interviews. Thematic analyses revealed 69 different reasons for eating or not eating eggs in this population. Reasons were related to: hedonics, properties of the food, preparation style, convenience, physical environment, variety, physical health/abilities, nutrition and health knowledge, food safety, social environment, morality, emotion, and habit. Some of these reasons are likely to be specific to egg consumption in older adults, e.g. properties of the food and convenience combined with physical health/abilities. Some reasons are also likely to be more relevant to older than younger individuals, e.g. medical factors. Investigation of the reasons most related to intake on a population-wide scale would aid the development of interventions.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Chemerin and its G protein-coupled receptor (ChemR23) have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the role of chemerin on insulin signalling in the vasculature is still unknown. We aimed to determine whether chemerin reduces vascular insulin signalling and whether there is interplay between chemerin/ChemR23, insulin resistance and vascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Molecular and vascular mechanisms were probed in mesenteric arteries and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from C57BL/6J, non-diabetic lean db/m and diabetic obese db/db mice as well as in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). Chemerin decreased insulin-induced vasodilatation in C57BL/6J mice, an effect prevented by CCX832 (ChemR23 antagonist) treatment. In VSMC, chemerin, via oxidative stress- and ChemR23-dependent mechanisms, decreased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation to the membrane and glucose uptake. In HMEC, chemerin decreased insulin-activated nitric oxide signalling. AMPK phosphorylation was reduced by chemerin in both HMEC and VSMC. CCX832 treatment of db/db mice decreased body weight, insulin and glucose levels and vascular oxidative stress. CCX832 also partially restored vascular insulin responses in db/db and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Our novel in vivo findings highlight chemerin/ChemR23 as a promising therapeutic target to limit insulin resistance and vascular complications associated with obesity-related diabetes.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Many bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are attributed to an increase in osteoclast number or activity; therefore, control of osteoclasts has significant clinical implications. This study shows how skullcapflavone II (SFII), a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity, regulates osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function. SFII inhibited osteoclastogenesis with decreased activation of MAPKs, Src, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which have been known to be redox sensitive. SFII decreased reactive oxygen species by scavenging them or activating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and its effects were partially reversed by hydrogen peroxide cotreatment or Nrf2 deficiency. In addition, SFII attenuated survival, migration, and bone resorption, with a decrease in the expression of integrin β, Src, and p130 Crk-associated substrate, and the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in differentiated osteoclasts. Furthermore, SFII inhibited osteoclast formation and bone loss in an inflammation- or ovariectomy-induced osteolytic mouse model. These findings suggest that SFII inhibits osteoclastogenesis through redox regulation of MAPKs, Src, and CREB and attenuates the survival and resorption function by modulating the integrin pathway in osteoclasts. SFII has therapeutic potential in the treatment and prevention of bone diseases caused by excessive osteoclast activity.-Lee, J., Son, H. S., Lee, H.

      "Abstract :'In skeletal muscle, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling can either support the complete regeneration of injured muscle or facilitate pathologic fibrosis and muscle degeneration. Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of genetic disorders that results in a progressive decline in muscle function and is characterized by the abundant deposition of fibrotic tissue. Unlike acute injury, where ECM remodeling is acute and transient, in MD, remodeling persists until fibrosis obstructs the regenerative efforts of diseased muscles. Thus, understanding how ECM is deposited and organized is critical in the context of muscle repair. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2) is a matricellular protein expressed by multiple cell types in response to tissue injury. Although used as a general marker of fibrosis, the cell type-dependent role of CTGF in dystrophic muscle has not been elucidated. To address this question, a conditional Ctgf myofiber and fibroblast-knockout mouse lines were generated and crossed to a dystrophic background. Only myofiber-selective inhibition of CTGF protected δ-sarcoglycan-null ( Sgcd) mice from the dystrophic phenotype, and it did so by affecting collagen organization in a way that allowed for improvements in dystrophic muscle regeneration and function. To confirm that muscle-specific CTGF functions to mediate collagen organization, we generated mice with transgenic muscle-specific overexpression of CTGF. Again, genetic modulation of CTGF in muscle was not sufficient to drive fibrosis, but altered collagen content and organization after injury. Our results show that the myofibers are critical mediators of the deleterious effects associated with CTGF in MD and acutely injured skeletal muscle.-Petrosino, J. M., Leask, A., Accornero, F.

The current study demonstrated that, in 142 archived colorectal carcinoma (CRC) tissue samples, SCC-S2 expression was significantly correlated with higher histological grade ( p=0.001), tumor invasion ( p=0.001), advanced Dukes staging ( p=0.002), positive regional lymph node metastasis ( p=0.024), and poor overall survival ( p<0.001). MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and Transwell assays showed that SCC-S2 significantly promoted the proliferation and invasion. SCC-S2 expression was also accompanied by the overexpression CyclinD1, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), active-β-catenin, yes-associated protein (YAP), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), as well as the depression of p-large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (p-LATS1) and p-YAP. Moreover, SCC-S2 interacted and colocalized with LATS1, the interaction may interrupt Hippo signaling and thereafter activate canonical Wnt signaling. In conclusion, our data suggested that SCC-S2 was associated with the progression and unfavorable prognosis of CRCs. Meanwhile, SCC-S2 facilitated canonical Wnt signaling and its downstream effectors (CyclinD1, MMP-7) and promoted tumor proliferation and invasion, which depended on the inhibition of Hippo signaling induced by SCC-S2-LATS1 interaction. These results indicated that SCC-S2 might be used as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.'\n"

Human GSTM1 null allele is associated with toxicity and cancers. Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have molecular and enzymatic similarities of GSTs to humans; however, genetic variants have not been investigated. In macaques, instead of pseudogenized GSTM1, GSTM5 is a predominant GSTM isoform. 2. In this study, resequencing of GSTM5 in 64 cynomolgus and 31 rhesus macaques found 6 non-synonymous variants, and 1 variant (IVS5\\u2009+\\u20091) causing exon skip. Of these 7 variants, 3 and 1 were found only in Indochinese and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, respectively. 3. Cynomolgus GSTM5-mediated styrene 7,8-oxide and trans-stilbene oxide conjugation activities correlated with GSTM protein levels immunochemically quantified in cynomolgus liver samples. Using recombinant GSTM5 proteins, 4 of the 6 non-synonymous variants including E29Q, L96R, M166V, and S201N showed substantially lower metabolic activities. Moreover, a homozygote for E29Q and heterozygotes for S201N or IVS5\\u2009+\\u20091 showed significantly lower conjugation activities in liver cytosolic fractions as compared with wild-type animals. 4. Therefore, the present results suggest that inter-animal variability of GST-dependent drug metabolism is at least partly accounted for by GSTM5 variants in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques as preclinical animal models.'\n",

Recently, several natural products have been shown to exhibit promising tumor-killing properties.

In this study, after screening a high-throughput natural product library, we identified tanshinone I (Tan I) as a potential radiation sensitizer in lung cancer cells.\\n\\nMETHODS: Lung cancer radioresistant cell lines, H358-IR and H157-IR, were first established to confirm the radioresistant phenotypes. After that, a natural product library was used to screen the potential radiation sensitizer. We further examined the inhibition functions of Tan I on radioresistant cancer cells via a series of experiments.\\n\\nRESULTS: Tan I significantly inhibited cell proliferation and clone formation, consequently enhancing radiosensitivity in radioresistant lung cancer cells, H358-IR and H157-IR. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics indicated that Tan I downregulates expression of pro-oncogenic protein phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate aminotransferase (PPAT) in both H358-IR and H157-IR cells. Further analysis of molecular docking showed that Tan I is well-docked into the active pocket of the structure of PPAT, serving as a potential PPAT inhibitor.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of the tumor promoter PPAT by Tan I exerts marked inhibitory effects on radioresistant lung cancer cells, improving radiation efficacy.'\n",

Previous work has focused on determining protein expression levels under different growth conditions. A major gap of our knowledge is an understanding how these expressed proteins are assembled into complexes and organized into metabolic pathways, an area that has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we combined size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics to characterize many protein complexes in from Cyanothece 51142 cells grown under 12-h light-dark cycle. We identified 1386 proteins in duplicate biological replicates, and 64% of those proteins were identified as putative complexes. Pair-wise computational prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) identified 74,822 putative interactions, of which 2337 interactions were highly correlated with published protein co-expressions. Many sequential glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes were identified as putative complexes. We also identified many membrane complexes that contain cytoplasmic domains. Subunits of NDH-1 complex eluted in a fraction with an approximate mass of ~669 kDa, and subunits composition revealed co-existence of distinct forms of NDH-1 complex subunits responsible for respiration, electron flow and CO2 uptake. The complex form of the phycocyanin beta subunit was non-phosphorylated and the monomer form was phosphorylated at Ser20, suggesting phosphorylation-dependent de-oligomerization of the phycocyanin beta subunit. This study provides an analytical platform for future studies to reveal how these complexes assemble and disassemble as a function of diurnal and circadian rhythms.'\n",

The parameters were developed to reproduce experimental Kirkwood-Buff integral values, defined by the Kirkwood-Buff theory of solutions, and applied to simulations of glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose. Compared to the CHARMM36 carbohydrate parameters, these new Kirkwood-Buff-based parameters reproduced accurately carbohydrate self-association and the trend of activity coefficient derivative changes with concentration. When using these parameters, preferential interaction coefficients calculated from simulations of these carbohydrates and the proteins lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, α-chymotrypsinogen A, and RNase A agreed well with the experimental data, whereas use of the CHARMM36 parameters indicated preferential inclusion of carbohydrates, in disagreement with the experiment. Thus, calculating preferential interaction coefficients from simulations requires using a force field that accurately reproduces trends in the thermodynamic properties of binary excipient-water solutions, and in particular the trend in the activity coefficient derivative. Finally, the carbohydrate-protein simulations using the new parameters indicated that the carbohydrate size was a major factor in the distribution of different carbohydrates around a protein surface.'\n",

The engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae with efficient α-amyrin production pathway could be used as an alternative and sustainable solution to produce α-amyrin from renewable raw materials. To efficiently improve α-amyrin production in S. cerevisiae, we identified two α-ASs, EjAS and MdOSC1 from Eriobotrya japonica and Malus×domestica, respectively, through strict bioinformatics screening criteria and phylogenetic analysis. The specific activities of purified EjAS and MdOSC1 were 0.0032 and 0.0293 μmol/min/mg, respectively. EjAS produced α-amyrin and β-amyrin at a ratio of 17:3, MdOSC1 produced α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol at a ratio of 86:13:1, indicating MdOSC1 had significantly higher specific activity and higher ratio of α-amyrin than EjAS. Furthermore, MdOSC1 was introduced into S. cerevisiae combining with the increased supply of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to achieve the encouraging α-amyrin production, and the titer of α-amyrin achieved 11.97±0.61 mg/L, 5.8 folds of the maximum production reported.'\n",

Nonetheless, unnatural amino acids (Uaas) pose theoretical burdens on protein solubility, and determinants of position-specific tolerability to Uaas remain underexplored. To broadly examine associations, we systematically assessed the effect of substituting the fluorescent Uaa, acridonylalanine, at more than 50 chemically, evolutionarily, and structurally diverse residues in two bacterial proteins: LexA and RecA. Surprisingly, properties that ostensibly contribute to Uaa tolerability-such as conservation, hydrophobicity, or accessibility-demonstrated no consistent correlations with resulting protein solubility. Instead, solubility is closely dependent on the location of the substitution within the overall tertiary structure, suggesting that intrinsic properties of protein domains, and not individual positions, are stronger determinants of Uaa tolerability. Consequently, those who seek to install Uaas in new target proteins should consider broadening, rather than narrowing, the types of residues screened for Uaa incorporation.'\n",

Ibogaine, the principal alkaloid responsible for iboga\\'s psychedelic properties, was isolated and sold as an antidepressant in France for decades before its adverse effects precipitated its removal from the market. An ibogaine resurgence in the 1960s was driven by U.S. heroin addicts who claimed that ibogaine cured their opiate addictions. Behavioral pharmacologic studies in animal models provided evidence that ibogaine could blunt self-administration of not only opiates but cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine. Ibogaine displays moderate-to-weak affinities for a wide spectrum of receptor and transporter proteins; recent work suggests that its actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may underlie its reputed anti-opiate effects. At micromolar levels, ibogaine is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic, and has been linked to several deaths by cardiac arrest. Structure-activity studies led to the isolation of the ibogaine analog 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a α3β4 nicotinic receptor modulator that retains ibogaine\\'s anti-craving properties with few or no adverse effects.

RAP is most often considered functional (nonorganic) abdominal pain, but an organic cause is found in 5% to 10% of cases. Further workup is warranted in children who have RAP and fever, vomiting, blood in the stool, more than three alarm symptoms, or a history of urinary tract infections. Physical examination findings that should prompt further workup include weight loss or failure to grow; jaundice; costovertebral tenderness or back pain with lower extremity neurologic symptoms; liver, spleen, or kidney enlargement; an abdominal mass; or localized tenderness on abdominal examination. Workup may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, fecal guaiac testing, fecal ova and parasite testing, or urinalysis. Pregnancy testing and screening for sexually transmitted infections should be considered in adolescents or if there are concerns about sexual abuse. Abdominal radiography can be helpful for diagnosing obstruction or constipation. Abdominal ultrasonography identifies an abnormality in up to 10% of children with RAP who meet criteria for further workup, compared with 1% of those who do not meet these criteria. Functional abdominal pain is a clinical diagnosis and no workup is needed. Management of functional abdominal pain focuses on improving quality of life, reducing parent and child concerns about the seriousness of the condition, and reducing the disability associated with pain rather than complete resolution of pain.

These dietary patterns are supported by strong evidence that promotes a primary focus on unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. Added sugars should be limited to less than 5% to 10% of daily caloric intake. Vegetables (not including potatoes) and fruits should make up one-half of each meal. Carbohydrate sources should primarily include beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.

Recently, we reported colocalization of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-SNCA) and the largest subunit of dynactin (DCTN1) in Lewy body (LB)-like structures in Perry syndrome. Previous reports have not focused on the relationship between dynactin and synucleinopathies. Thus, we examined autopsied human brains from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with LBs, and multiple system atrophy using immunohistochemistry for p-SNCA, DCTN1, dynactin 2 (DCTN2, dynamitin) and dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1I1). We also examined microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs), which phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption. Both brainstem-type and cortical LBs were immunopositive for DCTN1, DCTN2, DYNC1I1 and p-MARK and their staining often overlapped with p-SNCA. Lewy neurites were also immunopositive for DCTN1, DCTN2 and DYNC1I1. However, p-SNCA-positive inclusions of multiple system atrophy, which included both glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, were immunonegative for DCTN1, DCTN2, DYNC1I1 and p-MARK. Thus, immunohistochemistry for dynein-dynactin complex molecules, especially DCTN1, can clearly distinguish LBs from neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Our results suggest that dynactin is closely associated with LB pathology.\"\n"

For each of the vitamins, we summarize the physiological role, the steps involved in the absorption, and the factors influencing the absorption. In addition, for some of the vitamins, the molecular base for absorption is described in details, while for others new aspects of relevance for human deficiency are included. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

      "Abstract :'The colon has large capacities for K absorption and K secretion, but its role in maintaining K homeostasis is often overlooked. For many years, passive diffusion and/or solvent drag were thought to be the primary mechanisms for K absorption in human and animal colon. However, it is now clear that apical H ,K -ATPase, in coordination with basolateral K -Cl cotransport and/or K and Cl channels operating in parallel, mediate electroneutral K absorption in animal colon. We now know that K absorption in rat colon reflects ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive apical H ,K -ATPase activities. Ouabain-insensitive and ouabain-sensitive H ,K -ATPases are localized in surface and crypt cells, respectively. Colonic H ,K -ATPase consists of α- (HKC ) and β- (HKC ) subunits which, when coexpressed, exhibit ouabain-insensitive H ,K -ATPase activity in HEK293 cells, while HKC coexpressed with the gastric β-subunit exhibits ouabain-sensitive H ,K -ATPase activity in Xenopus oocytes. Aldosterone enhances apical H ,K -ATPase activity, HKC specific mRNA and protein expression, and K absorption. Active K secretion, on the other hand, is mediated by apical K channels operating in a coordinated way with the basolateral Na -K -2Cl cotransporter. Both Ca -activated intermediate conductance K (IK) and large conductance K (BK) channels are located in the apical membrane of colonic epithelia. IK channel-mediated K efflux provides the driving force for Cl secretion, while BK channels mediate active (e.g., cAMP-activated) K secretion. BK channel expression and activity are increased in patients with end-stage renal disease and ulcerative colitis. This review summarizes the role of apical H ,K -ATPase in K absorption, and apical BK channel function in K secretion in health and disease. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

      "Abstract :'ATP sensitive potassium channels (K ) are so named because they open as cellular ATP levels fall. This leads to membrane hyperpolarization and thus links cellular metabolism to membrane excitability. They also respond to MgADP and are regulated by a number of cell signaling pathways. They have a rich and diverse pharmacology with a number of agents acting as specific inhibitors and activators. K channels are formed of pore-forming subunits, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, and a large auxiliary subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B). The Kir6.0 subunits are a member of the inwardly rectifying family of potassium channels and the sulfonylurea receptor is part of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins. Four SURs and four Kir6.x form an octameric channel complex and the association of a particular SUR with a specific Kir6.x subunit constitutes the K current in a particular tissue. A combination of mutagenesis work combined with structural studies has identified how these channels work as molecular machines. They have a variety of physiological roles including controlling the release of insulin from pancreatic β cells and regulating blood vessel tone and blood pressure. Furthermore, mutations in the genes underlie human diseases such as congenital diabetes and hyperinsulinism. Additionally, opening of these channels is protective in a number of pathological conditions such as myocardial ischemia and stroke. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

      "Abstract :'The immune response to acute muscle damage is important for normal repair. However, in chronic diseases such as many muscular dystrophies, the immune response can amplify pathology and play a major role in determining disease severity. Muscular dystrophies are inheritable diseases that vary tremendously in severity, but share the progressive loss of muscle mass and function that can be debilitating and lethal. Mutations in diverse genes cause muscular dystrophy, including genes that encode proteins that maintain membrane strength, participate in membrane repair, or are components of the extracellular matrix or the nuclear envelope. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that an important feature of many muscular dystrophies is an immune response adapted to acute, infrequent muscle damage that is misapplied in the context of chronic injury. We discuss the involvement of the immune system in the most common muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and show that the immune system influences muscle death and fibrosis as disease progresses. We then present information on immune cell function in other muscular dystrophies and show that for many muscular dystrophies, release of cytosolic proteins into the extracellular space may provide an initial signal, leading to an immune response that is typically dominated by macrophages, neutrophils, helper T-lymphocytes, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Although those features are similar in many muscular dystrophies, each muscular dystrophy shows distinguishing features in the magnitude and type of inflammatory response. These differences indicate that there are disease-specific immunomodulatory molecules that determine response to muscle cell damage caused by diverse genetic mutations. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

      "Abstract :'Cancer immunotherapy has made great strides in the recent decade, especially in the area of immune checkpoint blockade. The outstanding efficacy, prolonged durability of effect, and rapid assimilation of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in clinical practice have been nothing short of a medical breakthrough in the treatment of numerous malignancies. The major advantages of these therapeutic antibodies over their small molecule counterparts have been their high binding affinity and target specificity. However, antibodies do have their flaws including immune-related toxicities, inadequate pharmacokinetics and tumor penetration, and high cost burden to manufacturers and consumers. These limitations hinder broader clinical applications of the antibodies and have heightened interests in developing the alternative small molecule platform that includes peptidomimetics and peptides to target the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system. The progress on these small molecule alternatives has been relatively slow compared to that of the antibodies. Fortunately, recent structural studies of the interactions among PD-1, PD-L1, and their respective antibodies have revealed key hotspots on PD-1 and PD-L1 that may facilitate drug discovery efforts for small molecule immunotherapeutics. This review is intended to discuss key concepts in immuno-oncology, describe the successes and shortcomings of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-based therapies, and to highlight the recent development of small molecule inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interaction.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Introduction: Optimal diet together with good physical fitness maintains readiness and military performance during longer deployments. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in dietary macronutrient and energy intake, total physical activity and body composition during a 6-month deployment in South Lebanon. Furthermore, associations of diet macronutrient intake and physical activity on body composition were also studied.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods: Forty male soldiers kept a 3-day food diary and their body composition was measured via bioimpedance and ultrasonography. Total physical activity was evaluated by accelerometers in a subgroup of participants. Measurements were conducted in the PRE-, MID-, and POST-deployment.\\n\\nResults: Mean carbohydrate intakes were 39.5-42.6 E%, protein intakes 18.7-22.3 E%, and fat intakes 34.9-35.7 E%. Daily energy intake remained stable (10.1-10.3 MJ/D). Total physical activity was decreased during deployment (e.g., step count from 9,835 ± 2,743 to 8,388 ± 2,875 steps/day, p = 0.007). Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased by 1.3% (p = 0.019) and 1.9% (p = 0.006), respectively. Energy and fat intake associated positively with body mass and skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.31-0.48, p < 0.05-0.001).\\n\\nConclusions: Carbohydrate intakes and physical activity were low, compared with the general recommendations. Protein intakes were relatively high. Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased. Suboptimal diet together with low level of physical activity may have a negative impact on body composition, physical performance, and cardiometabolic health. Consequently, soldiers should be encouraged to consume more fiber-rich carbohydrates and less saturated fatty acids as well as maintain a high level of physical fitness to sustain military readiness during long-term deployments.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The tumour suppressor p53, encoded by TP53, is a key player in a wide network of signalling pathways. We investigated its role in the bioactivation of the environmental carcinogen 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA)found in diesel exhaust and its metabolites 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA) and N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-3-ABA) in a panel of isogenic human colorectal HCT116 cells differing only with respect to their TP53 status [i.e. TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-), TP53(-/-), TP53(R248W/+) or TP53(R248W/-)]. As a measure of metabolic competence, DNA adduct formation was determined using 32P-postlabelling. Wild-type (WT) p53 did not affect the bioactivation of 3-NBA; no difference in DNA adduct formation was observed in TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells. Bioactivation of both metabolites 3-ABA and N-OH-3-ABA on the other hand was WT-TP53 dependent. Lower 3-ABA- and N-OH-3-ABA-DNA adduct levels were found in TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells compared to TP53(+/+) cells, and p53's impact was attributed to differences in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 expression for 3-ABA whereas for N-OH-3-ABA, an impact of this tumour suppressor on sulphotransferase (SULT) 1A1/3 expression was detected. Mutant R248W-p53 protein function was similar to or exceeded the ability of WT-p53 in activating 3-NBA and its metabolites, measured as DNA adducts. However, identification of the xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme(s) (XMEs), through which mutant-p53 regulates these responses, proved difficult to decipher. For example, although both mutant cell lines exhibited higher CYP1A1 induction after 3-NBA treatment compared to TP53(+/+) cells, 3-NBA-derived DNA adduct levels were only higher in TP53(R248W/-) cells but not in TP53(R248W/+) cells. Our results show that p53's influence on carcinogen activation depends on the agent studied and thereby on the XMEs that mediate the bioactivation of that particular compound. The phenomenon of p53 regulating CYP1A1 expression in human cells is consistent with other recent findings; however, this is the first study highlighting the impact of p53 on sulphotransferase-mediated (i.e. SULT1A1) carcinogen metabolism in human cells.\"\n",

Fatty-acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was previously found to be associated with clinical renal dysfunction and was proposed as a biomarker of glomerular damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate FABP4 as a potential preclinical biomarker of drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI). Han - Wistar rats were dosed with cisplatin (2.5mg/kg, single, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), puromycin (10mg/kg, daily, i.p.) or N-phenylanthranylic acid (NPAA, 500mg/kg, daily, per os (p.o.)) over a 28-day period to induce proximal tubule, glomerular or collecting duct injury, respectively. An increase in urinary FABP4 levels was observed on days 1 and 3 after NPAA treatment and on days 14, 21 and 28 after puromycin treatment, whereas cisplatin treatment had no effect. No significant changes were reported for plasma levels of FABP4 after any treatment. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis showed a marked decrease in FABP4 expression in the loop of Henle on day 7 after NPAA treatment and a complete loss of FABP4 expression on day 14 after puromycin treatment. The magnitude of increase in FABP4 urinary levels in response to NPAA and puromycin was higher than for established preclinical biomarkers serum creatinine, clusterin or cystatin C. Our results suggest that FABP4 has the potential for preclinical application as a biomarker of DIKI.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The discovery of mammalian cardiac progenitor cells has suggested that the heart consists of not only terminally differentiated beating cardiomyocytes, but also a population of self-renewing stem cells with the potential to generate new cardiomyocytes (Anderson, Self et al. 2007; Bearzi, Rota et al. 2007; Wu, Chien et al. 2008). A consequence of longevity is continual exposure to environmental and xenobiotic stresses, and recent literature suggests that hematopoietic stem cell pools tightly control cell health through upregulation of the integrated stress response and consequent cellular mechanisms such as apoptosis. However, whether or not this biological response is conserved in progenitor cells for later lineages of tissue specific stem cells is not well understood. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of both cardiac progenitor and mature cardiomyocyte lineages, we found that the integrated stress response was upregulated in the iPSC cardiac progenitors leading to an increased sensitivity for apoptosis relative to the mature cardiomyocytes. Of interest, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) signaling plays a mechanistic role in the cell death phenotype observed in iPSC progenitors, by which depletion of CHOP prevents cell death following cellular stress by thapsigargin exposure. Our studies suggest that the integrated stress response plays a unique role in maintaining iPSC cardiac progenitor cellular integrity by removing unhealthy cells via apoptosis following environmental and xenobiotic stresses, thus preventing differentiation and self-renewal of damaged cells.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Transcription factor Nrf2 protects hepatocytes against various toxicants by upregulating cytoprotective genes. The heme synthesis inhibitor 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) leads to liver injury around the portal vein, unlike other groups of toxicants that cause hemorrhage and necrosis in the centrilobular area. To examine whether and how Nrf2 protects livers from the injury, we fed DDC to Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2KO), wild-type (WT), Keap1flox/flox (Keap1-knockdown; Keap1KD), and liver-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1-Alb) mice, as these lines of mice exhibit stepwise increases in Nrf2 protein expression levels. Liver-specific Keap1::Nrf2 double-knockout (Keap1::Nrf2-Alb) mice were also exploited to examine the contribution of Nrf2. Two weeks after DDC-feeding, Keap1-Alb mice were fully recovered from body-weight-loss, but the WT and Nrf2KO mice were not. The liver-to-body-weight ratio of Keap1-Alb mice was significantly larger than that of WT and Nrf2KO mice. Two indicators of hepatotoxicity, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin in plasma, were both elevated in WT mice, but downregulated in Keap1-Alb mice after the DDC-feeding. DDC-induced porphyrin accumulation was reduced in the livers of Keap1-Alb and Keap1KD mice compared with that of WT mice. When assessed by the Nqo1 level, Nrf2 expression was further enhanced by DDC in Keap1-Alb mice, suggesting that DDC may have a Keap1-independent potential to activate Nrf2. Genetic activation of Nrf2 in Keap1-Alb mice increased the extracellular excretion of porphyrins, but contrary to our expectation, hepatic damages in Nrf2KO mice appeared to be similar to that of WT mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that Nrf2 activation protects livers against DDC-elicited hepatotoxicity.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation et\\xa0al, are very important biological processes. PTM changes in some critical genes, which may be induced by base-pair substitution, are shown to affect the risk of diseases. Recently, large-scale exome-wide association studies found that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play an important role in the susceptibility for complex diseases or traits. One of the functional mechanisms of missense SNPs is that they may affect PTMs and leads to a protein dysfunction and its downstream signaling pathway disorder. Here, we constructed a database named AWESOME (A Website Exhibits SNP On Modification Event, http://www.awesome-hust.com), which is an interactive web-based analysis tool that systematically evaluates the role of SNPs on nearly all kinds of PTMs based on 20 available tools. We also provided a well-designed scoring system to compare the performance of different PTM prediction tools and help users to get a better interpretation of results. Users can search SNPs, genes or position of interest, filter with specific modifications or prediction methods, to get a comprehensive PTM change induced by SNPs. In summary, our database provides a convenient way to detect PTM-related SNPs, which may potentially be pathogenic factors or therapeutic targets.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes evolved from bacterial ribosomes by reduction of ribosomal RNAs, increase of ribosomal protein content, and loss of guanine nucleotides. Guanine is the base most sensitive to oxidative damage. By systematically comparing high-quality, small ribosomal subunit RNA sequence alignments and solved 3D ribosome structures from mammalian mitochondria and bacteria, we deduce rules for folding a complex RNA with the remaining guanines shielded from solvent. Almost all conserved guanines in both bacterial and mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal RNA form guanine-specific, local or long-range, RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. Many solvent-exposed guanines conserved in bacteria are replaced in mammalian mitochondria by bases less sensitive to oxidation. New guanines, conserved only in the mitochondrial alignment, are strategically positioned at solvent inaccessible sites to stabilize the ribosomal RNA structure. New mitochondrial proteins substitute for truncated RNA helices, maintain mutual spatial orientations of helices, compensate for lost RNA-RNA interactions, reduce solvent accessibility of bases, and replace guanines conserved in bacteria by forming specific amino acid-RNA interactions.'\n",

However, our understanding of how a deficiency in Lys biosynthesis impacts plant metabolism and growth remains limited. Here we used a previously characterized Arabidopsis mutant with reduced activity of the Lys biosynthesis enzyme L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (dapat) to investigate the physiological and metabolic impacts of impaired Lys biosynthesis. Despite displaying similar stomatal conductance and internal CO2 concentration, we observed reduced photosynthesis and growth in the dapat mutant. Surprisingly, whilst no differences in dark respiration were observed between genotypes, a lower storage and consumption of starch and sugars was observed in dapat plants. Additionally, higher protein turnover but no differences in total amino acids were observed during a diurnal cycle in dapat plants. Transcriptional and two-dimensional (IEF/SDS-PAGE) proteome analyses demonstrated alterations in the abundance of several transcripts and proteins associated with photosynthesis and photorespiration coupled with a high glycine/serine ratio and increased levels of stress-responsive amino acids. Our findings demonstrate that biochemical alterations rather than stomatal limitations were responsible for the decreased photosynthesis and growth of the dapat mutants; which we hypothesize mimic stress conditions associated with impairments in Lys biosynthesis pathway.'\n",

The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper protein (HBZ) is expressed in all cases of ATL and is directly associated with virus pathogenicity. The two isoforms of the HBZ protein are synthesized from antisense messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are either spliced (sHBZ) or unspliced (usHBZ) versions of the HBZ transcript. The sHBZ and usHBZ mRNAs have entirely different 5'untranslated regions (5'UTR) and are differentially expressed in cells, with the sHBZ protein being more abundant. Here, we show that differential expression of the HBZ isoforms is regulated at the translational level. Translation initiation of the usHBZ mRNA relies on a cap-dependent mechanism, while the sHBZ mRNA uses internal initiation. Based on the structural data for the sHBZ 5'UTR generated by SHAPE in combination with 5' and 3' deletion mutants, the minimal region harboring IRES activity was mapped to the 5'end of the sHBZ mRNA. In addition, the sHBZ IRES recruited the 40S ribosomal subunit upstream of the initiation codon, and IRES activity was found to be dependent on the ribosomal protein eS25 and eIF5A.\"\n",

A biopsy of deltoid muscle documented the disappearance of M-line, the misalignment of myofilaments, and the loss of the distinction between the A and I bands. Complete resolution of muscle weakness occurred after one year of treatment with antiTNFα agent Etanercept. Because of the acute onset of symptoms and the recovery after immunosuppressive treatment we hypothesized that an immune-mediated mechanism was responsible for the muscle disorder. The serum IgG-mediated autoreactivity to skeletal muscle antigens resolved by bidimensional electrophoresis was assessed in the described patient and compared with that of control subjects. The comparative analysis of the immunoreactive spots revealed that ATP synthase subunit α is specifically recognized by patient's serum, suggesting that the protein might represent a putative antigenic target in the disease.

      "Abstract :'Polycystin-1 (PC1), encoded by the PKD1 gene that is mutated in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney disease, regulates a number of processes including bone development. Activity of the transcription factor RunX2, which controls osteoblast differentiation, is reduced in Pkd1 mutant mice but the mechanism governing PC1 activation of RunX2 is unclear. PC1 undergoes regulated cleavage that releases its C-terminal tail, which translocates to the nucleus to modulate transcriptional pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis. We find that the cleaved carboxy-terminal tail of PC1 (PC1-CTT) stimulates the transcriptional co-activator TAZ (Wwtr1), an essential co-activator of RunX2. PC1-CTT physically interacts with TAZ, stimulating RunX2 transcriptional activity in pre-osteoblast cells in a TAZ-dependent manner. The PC1-CTT increases the interaction between TAZ and RunX2 and enhances the recruitment of the p300 transcriptional co-regulatory protein to the TAZ/RunX2/PC1-CTT complex. Zebrafish injected with morpholinos directed against pkd1 manifest severe bone calcification defects and a curly tail phenotype. Injection of mRNA encoding the PC1-CTT into pkd1-morphant fish restores bone mineralization and reduces the severity of the curly tail phenotype. These effects are abolished by co-injection of morpholinos directed against TAZ. Injection of mRNA encoding a dominant-active TAZ construct is sufficient to rescue both the curly tail phenotype and the skeletal defects observed in pkd1-morpholino treated fish. Thus, TAZ constitutes a key mechanistic link through which PC1 mediates its physiological functions.'\n"

The monocarboxylic acid transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, are thought to contribute to the absorption of SCFAs from the surface of the rumen following weaning. The present study measured changes in MCT1 and MCT4 expression in ruminal epithelial cells isolated from male preweaning (22 to 34 d old, n = 6) and postweaning (55 to 58 d old, n = 8) calves after euthanasia and sought to examine whether SCFAs stimulate the expression of these transporters. In the current study, cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) gene expression in the rumen was also investigated since CD147 has been considered to act as ancillary protein for MCT1 and MCT4 to express their correct function. The gene expression levels of MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 in the rumen were found to be significantly higher in postweaning calves than in preweaning calves. Strong MCT1 immunoreactivity was detected in both the stratum basale (SB) and the stratum spinosum (SS) in postweaning ruminal epithelium. Expression of MCT1 in preweaning calves was localized to a specific region of the SB and of the SS. MCT4-immunopositive cells were detected in the stratum corneum (SC) of the ruminal epithelium in postweaning calves. However, only a low level of signal was detected in the SC of preweaning animals. Furthermore, in vitro experiments, ruminal epithelial cells were incubated for 24 h with acetate (0.04, 0.4, and 4 mM), propionate (0.2, 2, and 20 mM), butyrate (0.1, 1, and 10 mM), or β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA; 0.1, 1, and 10 mM), respectively. Both propionate and butyrate induced an increase in the gene expression levels of MCT4 and CD147, but did not affect MCT1 gene expression. There are no significant effects of acetate and BHBA treatment on these gene expressions. Taken together, these results suggest that an increase in MCT4 and CD147 gene expression in the ruminal epithelium of postweaning calves is likely to be due to the effects of propionate and butyrate derived from a solid-based diet, which may contribute to ruminal development following weaning.'\n",

We first observed a close relationship between Integrin αV and SIN3B expressions in HCC patients and tumor cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Overexpression of SIN3B significantly accelerated the cell migration rate of SMMC-7721, but failed when integrin αV expression was silenced. Interestingly, SIN3B stimulated integrin αV subunit promoter activity only in the presence of sulfatide. Importantly, SIN3B was identified in the complex with sulfatide by mass spectrometry. Fat blot assay indicated that SIN3B specifically interacted with sulfatide. Molecular modeling suggested that sulfatide induced the conformational change of SIN3B from compacted α-helices to a relaxed β-sheet in PAH2 domain. The data of immunoprecipitation and ChIP assay indicated that altered SIN3B lost the binding affinity with MAD1 and HDAC2, which reduced the recruitment of HDAC2 on integrin αV gene promoter and prevented the deacetylation of the histone 3. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SIN3B promoted the transcriptional activation of the integrin αV subunit gene promoter by reducing interaction with HDAC2.'\n",

Knock down of myl1 in zebrafish resulted in abnormal morphology, disrupted muscle structure and impaired touch-evoked escape responses, thus confirming that skeletal muscle fast-twitch specific myosin essential light chain is critical for myofibre development and function.\\n\\nINTERPRETATION: Our data implicate MYL1 as a crucial protein for adequate skeletal muscle function and that MYL1 deficiency is associated with a severe congenital myopathy.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The colonization of novel environments often involves changes in gene expression, protein coding sequence, or both. Studies of how populations adapt to novel conditions, however, often focus on only one of these two processes, potentially missing out on the relative importance of different parts of the evolutionary process. In this study, our objectives were (1) to better understand the qualitative concordance between conclusions drawn from analyses of differential expression and changes in genic sequence and (2) to quantitatively test whether differentially expressed genes were enriched for sites putatively under positive selection within gene regions. To achieve this, we compared populations of fish (Poecilia mexicana) that have independently adapted to hydrogen-sulfide-rich environments in southern Mexico to adjacent populations residing in non-sulfidic waters. Specifically, we used RNA-sequencing data to compare both gene expression and DNA sequence differences between populations. Analyzing these two different data types led to similar conclusions about which biochemical pathways (sulfide detoxification and cellular respiration) were involved in adaptation to sulfidic environments. Additionally, we found a greater overlap between genes putatively under selection and differentially expressed genes than expected by chance. We conclude that considering both differential expression and changes in DNA sequence lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how these populations adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Our results imply that changes in both gene expression and DNA sequence - sometimes at the same loci - may be involved in adaptation.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Birdshot Uveitis (Birdshot) is a rare eye condition that affects HLA-A29-positive individuals and could be considered a prototypic member of the recently proposed \"MHC-I-opathy\" family. Genetic studies have pinpointed the ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes as shared associations across MHC-I-opathies, which suggests ERAP dysfunction may be a root cause for MHC-I-opathies. We mapped the ERAP1 and ERAP2 haplotypes in 84 Dutch cases and 890 controls. We identified association at variant rs10044354, which mediated a marked increase in ERAP2 expression. We also identified and cloned an independently associated ERAP1 haplotype (tagged by rs2287987) present in more than half of the cases; this ERAP1 haplotype is also the primary risk and protective haplotype for other MHC-I-opathies. We show that the risk ERAP1 haplotype conferred significantly altered expression of ERAP1 isoforms in transcriptomic data (n=360), resulting in lowered protein expression and distinct enzymatic activity. Both the association for rs10044354 (meta-analysis: OR[95% CI]=2.07[1.58-2.71], p=1.24 × 10(-7)) and rs2287987 (OR[95% CI]: =2.01[1.51-2.67], p=1.41 × 10(-6)) replicated and showed consistent direction of effect in an independent Spanish cohort of 46 cases and 2,103 controls. In both cohorts, the combined rs2287987-rs10044354 haplotype associated with Birdshot more strongly than either SNP alone (meta-analysis: p=3.9 × 10(-9)). Finally, we observed that ERAP2 protein expression is dependent on the ERAP1 background across three European populations (n=3,353). In conclusion, a functionally distinct combination of ERAP1 and ERAP2 are a hallmark of Birdshot and provide rationale for strategies designed to correct ERAP function for treatment of Birdshot and MHC-I-opathies more broadly.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Most pathogenic missense mutations cause specific molecular phenotypes through protein destabilization. However, how protein destabilization is manifested as a given molecular phenotype is not well understood. We develop here a structural and energetic approach to describe mutational effects on specific traits such as function, regulation, stability, subcellular targeting or aggregation propensity. This approach is tested using large-scale experimental and structural perturbation analyses in over thirty mutations in three different proteins (cancer-associated NQO1, TTR related with amyloidosis and AGT linked to primary hyperoxaluria type I) and comprising five very common pathogenic mechanisms (loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic function aggregation, enzyme inactivation, protein mistargeting and accelerated degradation). Our results revealed that the magnitude of destabilizing effects, and particularly, their propagation through the structure to promote disease-associated conformational states largely determine the severity and molecular mechanisms of disease-associated missense mutations. Modulation of the structural perturbation at a mutated site is also shown to cause switches between different molecular phenotypes. When very common disease-associated missense mutations were investigated, we also found that they were not among the most deleterious possible missense mutations at those sites, and required additional contributions from codon bias and effects of CpG sites to explain their high frequency in patients. Our work sheds light on the molecular basis of pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype relationships, with implications for discriminating between pathogenic and neutral changes within human genome variability from whole genome sequencing studies.'\n",

VAMP7, a vesicular SNARE protein, regulates autophagosome formation to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and control insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. However, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of VAMP7-dependent autophagosome formation using VAMP7-deficient β-cells and β-cell derived Min6 cells. VAMP7 localised in Atg9a-resident vesicles of recycling endosomes (REs), which contributed to autophagosome formation, and interacted with Hrb, Syntaxin16, and SNAP-47. Hrb recruited VAMP7 and Atg9a from the plasma membrane to REs. Syntaxin16 and SNAP-47 mediated autophagosome formation at a step later than the proper localisation of VAMP7 to Atg9a-resident vesicles. Knockdown of Hrb, Syntaxin16, and SNAP-47 resulted in defective autophagosome formation, accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our data indicate that VAMP7 and Atg9a are initially recruited to REs to organise VAMP7 and Atg9a-resident vesicles in a Hrb-dependent manner. In addition, VAMP7 forms a SNARE complex with Syntaxin16 and SNAP-47, which may cause fusions of Atg9a-resident vesicles during autophagosome formation. Thus, VAMP7 participates in autophagosome formation by supporting Atg9a functions that contribute to maintenance of mitochondrial quality.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Skeletal muscle is one of the major organs responsible for body movements and metabolism making up approximately 40% of the total body mass. During aging, skeletal muscle exhibits a degenerative age-associated decline in mass and function termed sarcopenia. This age-associated dysfunction of skeletal muscle is a major criterion of morbidity, mortality, and overall declines of quality of life in the elderly. Therefore, researchers have focused on identifying modulators of muscle aging process including mRNAs, proteins, and recently small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). In particular, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play a critical role in skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. Recent studies revealed that miRNAs were also involved in muscle aging processes and the rejuvenation of aged muscle by regulating important molecules and pathways of aging including insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), NAD (+)-dependent protein deacetylase surtuin 1 (SIRT1), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. Over the years, miRNAs have emerged as promising candidates for biomarkers of sarcopenia and targets for interventions to slow muscle aging. Here we comprehensively review the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs in skeletal muscle aging and highlight their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for skeletal muscle health.'\n",

Recently, necroptosis, a necrosis form caused by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Fas ligand (FasL), was found to be regulated by receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and RIP3-receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-mixed lineage kinase domain like protein (MLKL) pathway. But it is unclear whether they also play a regulatory role in MIRI-induced necroptosis. Our previous results showed that in rat MIRI, RIP3 could translocate and express highly in mitochondria. Therefore, it is important to explore proteins that interact with RIP3 which was translocated to mitochondria. The aim of this study was to explore the role of RIP3 in cardiomyocyte necrosis induced by mitochondrial damage of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Our results showed that H/R could cause RIP3-depended mitochondrial fragmentation and necrosis-based death; and RIP3-promoted H/R-induced necroptosis in H9c2 cells through increasing lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibiting cell viability. This process did not require RIP1 or MLKL but dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was related to Drp1 activation, reactive oxygen species elevation, and ΔΨm decline. This study provides novel insights into the role of RIP3 in cardiomyocyte injury during H/R. RIP3 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of MIRI.'\n"

While studies have investigated the differential gene expression for different sutures, little is known about gene expression changes during suture fusion. The aim of this study was to examine gene expression in patent, fusing, and fused regions along sagittal suture specimens in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients. METHODS Sagittal sutures were collected from 7 patients (average age 4.5 months) who underwent minimally invasive craniotomies at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU under IRB approval. The sutures were analyzed using micro-CT to evaluate patency. The areas were classified as open, fusing, or fused and were harvested, and mRNA was isolated. Gene expression for bone-related proteins, osteogenic and angiogenic factors, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, and Wnt signaling was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and compared with normal sutures collected from fetal demise tissue (control). RESULTS Micro-CT demonstrated that there are variable areas of closure along the length of the sagittal suture. When comparing control samples to surgical samples, there was a significant difference in genes for Wnt signaling, TGF-β, angiogenic and osteogenic factors, bone remodeling, and nuclear rigidity in mRNA isolated from the fusing and fused areas of the sagittal suture compared with patent areas (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis, the affected suture has variable areas of being open, fusing, and fused. These specific areas have different mRNA expression. The results suggest that BMP-2, FGFR3, and several other signaling pathways play a significant role in the regulation of suture fusion as well as in the maintenance of patency in the normal suture.\"\n",

M4 and DTMBA metabolites co-eluted in the same HPLC peak; this co-elute peak exhibited a Michaelis-Menten kinetic, whereas M7 showed a substrate inhibition kinetics. The K for co-eluted M4/DTMBA and M7 was 24.2±5.6 and 116.0±52.6 μM, the V was 0.280±0.015 and 0.180±0.060 nmoles/min/mg protein, and the CL was 11.5 and 1.5\\u2009mL/min/g protein, respectively.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: omeprazole and omeprazole+diammonium glycyrrhizinate, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated after oral administration. It was found that using the omeprazole along with the diammonium glycyrrhizinate increased the AUC, AUMC, C for omeprazole. 3. For this reason, we used the LC-MS/MS to detect the binding rate of plasma protein (BRPP) of omeprazole in rats, it was found that diammonium glycyrrhizinate could decrease the BRPP in rats. In addition, we found that diammonium glycyrrhizinate specifically inhibited the enzyme activity of the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of the omeprazole. 4. These results mean that diammonium glycyrrhizinate could inhibit the metabolism and increase the plasma concentration of the omeprazole in rats.

Compound A (CpdA), identified as a selective NR3C1/glucocorticoid receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) modulator, exhibits an inflammation-suppressive effect, largely in the absence of detrimental side effects. To understand the mechanistic differences between the classic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) and CpdA, we looked for proteins oppositely regulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages using an unbiased proteomics approach. We found that the autophagy receptor SQSTM1 but not NR3C1\\xa0mediates the anti-inflammatory action of CpdA. CpdA drives SQSTM1 upregulation by recruiting the NFE2L2 transcription factor to its promoter. In contrast, the classic NR3C1 ligand dexamethasone recruits NR3C1 to the Sqstm1 promoter and other NFE2L2-controlled gene promoters, resulting in gene downregulation. Both DEX and CpdA induce autophagy, with marked different autophagy characteristics and morphology. Suppression of LPS-induced Il6 and Ccl2 genes by CpdA in macrophages is hampered upon Sqstm1 silencing, confirming that SQSTM1 is essential for the anti-inflammatory capacity of CpdA, at least in this cell type. Together, these results demonstrate how off-target mechanisms of selective NR3C1 ligands may contribute to a more efficient anti-inflammatory therapy.'\n"

XBs are able to mediate protein-ligand recognition and therefore play an important role in rational drug design. In this context, the development of molecular modeling tools that can tackle XBs is paramount. XBs are predominantly explained by the existence of a positive region on the electrostatic potential of X named the σ-hole. Typically, with molecular mechanics force fields, this region is modeled using a charged extra point (EP) linked to X along the R-X covalent bond axis. In this work, we developed the first EP-based strategy for GROMOS force fields (specifically GROMOS 54A7) using bacteriophage T4 lysozyme in complex with both iodobenzene and iodopentafluorobenzene as a prototype system. Several EP parametrization schemes were tested by adding a virtual interaction site to ligand topologies retrieved from the Automated Topology Builder (ATB) and Repository. Contrary to previous approaches using other force fields, our analysis is based on the capability of each parametrization scheme to sample XBs during MD simulations. Our results indicate that the implementation of an EP at a distance from iodine corresponding to R provides a good qualitative description of XBs in MD simulations, supporting the compatibility of our approach with the GROMOS 54A7 force field.'\n",

We find that the fluorescent protein phycoerythrin provides uniquely suitable properties with exceptionally intense and homogeneous single-fluorophore brightness that can overcome arbitrary spot detection threshold biases. Major limitations imposed by nonspecifically bound fluorophores were then overcome using rolling circle amplification to densely label cancer associated miRNA biomarkers, allowing accurate single molecule detection and calibration across nearly 5 orders of magnitude of concentration with a detection limit of 29 femtomolar.

Recent advances in spatial and temporal resolution of biophysical measurements have revealed \"beyond-two-state\" complexity in protein folding, even for small, single-domain proteins. In this work, we used high-resolution optical tweezers to investigate the folding/unfolding kinetics of the B1 domain of immunoglobulin-binding protein G (GB1), a well-studied model system. Experiments were performed for GB1 both in and out of equilibrium using force spectroscopy. When the force was gradually ramped, simple single-peak folding force distributions were observed, while multiple rupture peaks were seen in the unfolding force distributions, consistent with multiple force-dependent parallel unfolding pathways. Force-dependent folding and unfolding rate constants were directly determined by both force-jump and fixed-trap measurements. Monte Carlo modeling using these rate constants was in good agreement with the force ramp data. The unfolding rate constants exhibited two different behaviors at low vs high force. At high force, the unfolding rate constant increased with increasing force, as previously reported by high force, high pulling speed force ramp measurements. However, at low force, the situation reversed and the unfolding rate constant decreased with increasing force. Taken together, these data indicate that this small protein has multiple distinct pathways to the native state on the free energy landscape.'\n",

Here we present a study performed on a stabilized mutant of the second β-hairpin of the GB1 domain, where we combine steady-state fluorescence, laser-induced temperature-jump, and contact formation measurements to unveil the role of elementary structural components on hairpin dynamics and overall stability. In particular, our methodology provides access to the conformational dynamics of both the folded and unfolded state of the hairpin under native conditions, revealing the presence of extremely slow dynamics on the microsecond time scale in the unfolded state and coexistence of structures with partial pairing of the tails in the folded state. Comparing model peptides that mimic the turn sequence, we found that both ion pairing and hydrogen bonding due to the threonine side chain contribute to the propensity of turn formation but not to the much slower dynamics of the hydrophobic core formation. Interestingly, the dynamics of the turn region in isolation are significantly faster than the dynamics measured for the unfolded state of the complete hairpin, suggesting that non-native hydrophobic contacts slow down the reconfiguration dynamics of the unfolded state. Overall, the information extracted from these experiments provides kinetic limits on interconversions among conformational populations, hence enabling a simplified multistate free-energy landscape for the GB1 hairpin to be drawn.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Many unrelated proteins and peptides have been found spontaneously to form amyloid fibers above a critical concentration. Even for a single sequence, however, the amyloid fold is not a single well-defined structure. Although the cross-β hydrogen bonding pattern is common to all amyloids, all other aspects of amyloid fiber structures are sensitive to both the sequence of the aggregating peptides and the solvent conditions under which the aggregation occurs. Amyloid fibers are easy to identify and grossly characterize using microscopy, but their insolubility and aperiodicity along the dimensions transverse to the fiber axis have complicated detailed experimental structural characterization. In this paper, we explore the landscape of possibilities for amyloid protofilament structures that are made up of a single stack of peptides associated in a parallel in-register manner. We view this landscape as a two-dimensional version of the usual three-dimensional protein folding problem: the survey of the two-dimensional folds of protein ribbons. Adopting this view leads to a practical method of predicting stable protofilament structures of arbitrary sequences. We apply this scheme to variants of Aβ, the amyloid forming peptide that is characteristically associated with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with what is known from experiment, we find that Aβ protofibrils are polymorphic. To our surprise, however, the ribbon-folding landscape of Aβ turned out to be strikingly simple. We confirm that, at the level of the monomeric protofilament, the landscape for the Aβ sequence is reasonably well funneled toward structures that are similar to those that have been determined by experiment. The landscape has more distinct minima than does a typical globular protein landscape but fewer and deeper minima than the landscape of a randomly shuffled sequence having the same overall composition. It is tempting to consider the possibility that the significant degree of funneling of Aβ's ribbon-folding landscape has arisen as a result of natural selection. More likely, however, the intermediate complexity of Aβ's ribbon-folding landscape has come from the post facto selection of the Aβ sequence as an object of study by researchers because only by having a landscape with some degree of funneling can ordered aggregation of such a peptide occur at in vivo concentrations. In addition to predicting polymorph structures, we show that predicted solubilities of polymorphs correlate with experiment and with their elongation free energies computed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics.\"\n"

We currently count one domesticated herbivore for two people in the world and the number is growing. Production systems and products are highly diverse. This high diversity is the result of thousands of years of natural selection and human-controlled breeding, as well as migration and trade. Because of the high diversity of domestic herbivore genetic resources, herders have been able to live in regions where no alternative for income generation exists. Meat and milk from domestic herbivores provide 16% and 8% of the global protein and kilocalorie consumption, respectively. They also provide a variety of essential micronutrients but can contribute to overweight and obesity when consumed in excess. Domestic herbivores also make significant contribution to food security through the production of manure, draught power and transport and the generation of income at household and national level. They have a key role to play in women's empowerment and gender equality, both in rural and urban areas.Demand for meat and milk is increasing because of population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation. This trend is expected to continue, especially in Latin America, South Asia and China. The sustainable development of domestic herbivore production needs to address the feed/food and the efficiency of herbivores in turning forages into protein. It also needs to address the contribution of herbivores to greenhouse gas emissions, especially of ruminants through enteric fermentation, and their mitigation potential, including through carbon sequestration. Animal genetic resources have a key role to play in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The role of ruminants in the circular bioeconomy needs to be enhanced, promoting the use of by-products and waste as livestock feed and the recycling of manure for energy and nutrients. Finally, the role of domestic herbivores in providing secure livelihoods and economic opportunities for millions of smallholder farmers and pastoralists needs to be enhanced. The sustainable development of the sector therefore requires adequate policies, and there are already a variety of mechanisms available, including regulations, cross-compliance systems, payments for environmental services and research and development. Priority areas for policy makers should be aligned with the global framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and include: (i) food security and nutrition, (ii) economic development and livelihoods, (iii) animal and human health and finally, (iv) environment, climate and natural resources.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe sight-threatening complication of diabetes. It causes progressive damage to the retina and is the most common cause of vision impairment and blindness among diabetic patients. DR develops as a result of various changes in the ocular environment. Such changes include accelerated mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production, and formation of acellular capillaries. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are one of the major culprits in causing DR. Under physiological conditions, MMPs cause remodeling of the extracellular matrix in the retina, while under pathological conditions, they induce retinal cell apoptosis. This review focuses on the roles of various MMPs, primarily MMP-2 and MMP-9 in DR and also their participation in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, along with their involvement in various signaling pathways. This review also underscores different strategies to inhibit MMPs, thus suggesting that MMPs may represent a putative therapeutic target in the treatment of DR.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Epithelial ovarian cancer is a serious public health problem worldwide with the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic cancers. The current standard-of-care for the treatment of ovarian cancer is based on chemotherapy based on adjuvant cisplatin/carboplatin and taxane regimens that represent the first-line agents for patients with advanced disease. The DNA repair activity of cancer cells determines the efficacy of anticancer drugs. These features make DNA repair mechanisms a promising target for novel cancer treatments. In this context a better understanding of the DNA damage response caused by antitumor agents has provided the basis for the use of DNA repair inhibitors to improve the therapeutic use of DNA-damaging drugs. In this review, we will discuss the functions of DNA repair proteins and the advances in targeting DNA repair pathways with special emphasis in the inhibition of HRR and BER in ovarian cancer. We focused in the actual efforts in the development and clinical use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for the intervention of BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient ovarian tumors. The clinical development of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and sporadic high-grade serous ovarian cancer is ongoing. Some phase II and phase III trials have been completed with promising results for ovarian cancer patients.'\n"

However, there are no reports on the generation of genome integration free and completely exogeneous gene silenced (footprint-free) ciPSCs that are tolerant to enzymatic single cell passage. In this study, we reprogrammed canine embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) using the auto-erasable replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus vector, SeVdp(KOSM)302L and generated two ciPSC lines. The ciPSCs were positive for pluripotent markers including alkaline phosphatase activity as well as OCT3/4, SOX2 and NANOG transcripts and NANOG, Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen-1 and partial TRA-1-60 protein expression, even after SeVdp(KOSM)302L removal. The ciPSCs were induced to differentiate into all the three germ layers as embryoid bodies in vitro and as teratomas in vivo. Furthermore, SeVdp(KOSM)302L-free ciPSCs maintained a normal karyotype even after repeated enzymatic single cell passaging. Therefore, to our knowledge, for the first time, we demonstrated the generation of footprint-free and high quality ciPSCs that can be passaged at the single cell-stage using enzymatic methods. Our method for generation of ciPSCs is a good step toward the development of clinical application of ciPSCs.'\n",

Although responses to checkpoint inhibitors are encouraging, and in some cases durable, these successes are not universal among all treated patients. In order to optimize our treatment approach utilizing immunotherapy, we must better understand the interaction between cancer and the immune system and evasion mechanisms.

However, mechanisms implied in the kidney fibrosis modulation after AE treatment for CKD remain elusive. Here, we explored protective effects of AE for renal fibrosis and the involved mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. The renal fibrosis mice model was established via Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). We found that AE administration significantly ameliorated UUO-induced impairment of renal, evidenced by improved the histopathological abnormalities, the body weight and abnormal renal function in mice model. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that TGF-β1 and Fibronectin expressions were significantly decreased in UUO mice compared with sham group. Meanwhile, we found that AE suppressed the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by TGF-β1 in vivo. AE improved cell survival and decreased the level of fibrosis related proteins under TGF-β1 induced fibrosis in HK-2 cells as well as in vitro. Furthermore, both wortmannin, an inhibitor for PI3K, and short hairpin RNAs for PI3K knockdown, abrogated TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, and decreased the suppression of fibrosis. These findings indicated that AE alleviated fibrosis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vivo and in vitro, which may provide a potential therapeutic option for CKD.'\n",

Herein, we describe an innovative method of culturing a three-dimensional stem cell mass (3DCM) in the XF condition and demonstrate the therapeutic potential and safety of XF-3DCMs in ischemic mice and in SCID/ BALB/c Slc-nu/nu nude mice, respectively. XF-3DCMs were generated by culturing hASCs on a maltose-binding protein-linked basic fibroblast growth factor-immobilized polystyrene surface. XF-3DCMs produced comparable amounts of angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-8 compared to 3DCMs formed in media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS-3DCMs). The majority of the mice injected with XF-3DCMs exhibited limb salvaging and displayed similar blood perfusion compared to normal limbs. To a similar degree as for FBS-3DCMs, XF-3DCMs enhanced therapeutic efficacy by increasing blood vessel regeneration, attenuating muscle degeneration and fibrosis, and facilitating the implantation of injected cells into host vessels. Further, the soft agar colony forming assay and in vivo tumorigenicity analysis showed that XF-3DCMs did not transform into tumor cells. No side effects were observed, including hematological and immunological toxicity, in mice injected with XF-3DCMs. These results suggest that XF-3DCMs show angiogenic and therapeutic efficacy in critical limb ischemia in mice and eliminate the safety problem of animal-derived material contamination, which is a prerequisite for clinical applications.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Following spinal cord injury (SCI), function is lost below the level of injury due to axon damage and demyelination. Spinal progenitors, and more broadly neural stem cells (NSCs), can promote the growth of axons through multiple mechanisms, yet their poor survival following transplantation has been limiting the ability to obtain functional effects. In this study, we investigated multi-channel poly(lactide-co¬-glycolide) (PLG) bridges, which reduce inflammation and promote axon regrowth, as a support for spinal progenitor survival and function at the injury epicenter. Specifically, we hypothesized that mouse embryonic day 14 (E14) spinal progenitors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) would lead to regenerative gains compared to age-matched adult progenitor controls, which are expected to have similar regenerative capacity to the endogenous progenitors. E14spinal EGFP-progenitors were transplanted into a lateral T9-10 hemisection and EGFP+ cells were evident in the bridge and contralateral tissue 8 weeks post-injury, with enhanced survival of E14 compared to adult transplants. Only E14 progenitor-loaded bridges increased axon regrowth compared to blank bridges, resulting in a 3.3-fold increase in axon density (1674 v 497 axons/mm2) and 3.6-fold increase in myelination (~30% of axons) after 8 weeks. By 6 months, NeuN+ neural bodies were increased within the bridge region of mice transplanted with E14 progenitors. Mice receiving E14 transplants exhibited modest improvements in locomotion, including an earlier ability to perform ipsilateral stepping. The combination of bridges with E14 progenitors produced synergistic reparative gains, with early axon growth and re-myelination followed by latent increases in neural bodies within the bridge.'\n",

No large-scale study has examined the underlying mechanisms in linezolid-resistant  (LRE) strains. We investigated these mechanisms and molecular characteristics in Chongqing, China.\\n\\nMETHODS: A total of 1,120 non-duplicated  strains collected from August 2014 to June 2017 underwent drug susceptibility testing. LRE strains were screened for , , and mutations in the 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 by PCR amplification and sequencing. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used for epidemiological analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: All 43 low-level LRE strains (minimum inhibitory concentration: 8-16 mg/L) harbored ;  and 23S rRNA mutations were not detected. Novel mutations in the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4-one deletion (Q103del) and four substitutions (S113L, T35A, I98V, and N79D)-were identified. Novel amino acid substitutions at positions E60K, G197D, and T285P of the OptrA protein were observed. MLST revealed 20 types of LRE strains; the most common type was ST16 (32.6%). PFGE showed 14 strains of ST16 with unique banding patterns. Eight novel sequence types (ST823 to ST830) and one allele (95) were identified for the first time in China.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: plays an important role in linezolid resistance and may serve as a marker for resistance screening. Since the L3 and L4 mutations did not simultaneously occur in the same strain, they play a negligible role in linezolid resistance. Epidemiological investigation suggested that the LRE cases were sporadic.'\n"

      "Abstract :'The treatment of ulceration or stomatitis with laser therapy is known to accelerate healing and relieve pain, but the underlying biological mechanism is not fully understood. The present study used a mouse model of ulceration to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CO₂ laser therapy accelerated the wound healing process. An ulcer was experimentally created in the palatal mucosa of the mouse and irradiated with light from a CO₂ laser. Compared with controls (no irradiation), laser irradiation induced the proliferation of epithelial cells and faster re-epithelialization of the wound area. Immunohistochemistry experiments showed that heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) was expressed mainly in the epithelium of normal palatal tissue, whereas there was little tenascin C (TnC) expression in the epithelium and mesenchyme under normal conditions. Laser irradiation induced HSP70 mRNA and protein expression in the lamina propria as well as TnC expression in the mesenchyme underlying the renewing epithelium. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts were exposed to heated culture medium or laser irradiation to establish whether hyperthermia mimicked the effect of laser irradiation. Culture of fibroblasts in heated medium increased the expressions of both TnC and TGF-β1, whereas laser irradiation induced only TnC expression. The present study indicates that CO₂ laser irradiation exerts a photobiogenic effect to up-regulate TnC expression without inducing TGF-β1 expression. We suggest that CO₂ laser therapy has an advantage over thermal stimulation.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Flagellar rotation regulates the phenomenon of chemotaxis in bacteria. The interaction between the stator unit and the rotor unit of the flagellar motors is responsible for switching the direction of bacterial flagellar rotation. However, the molecular interaction mechanism between the stator (MotA/MotB) and the rotor (FliG/FliM/FliN) proteins for the flagellar rotational direction switching was not very clear. To address this, the asymmetry in the copies of FliG, FliM, and FliN molecules was resolved by reconstructing the switch complex using a modeled rotor unit that fulfills the experimentally available geometric constraints. The diameter of our assembled switch complex supported the existing literature. Experimental evidence and the conformational spread model validates our constructed switch complex. Subsequently, normal mode analysis (NMA) on these constructed protomer units revealed that the most fluctuating molecule in the rotor unit is FliG, which interacts with the bacterial stator through its C-terminal domain. NMA also facilitates our understanding of the reorientation mechanism of FliG between the two states of its flagellar rotation, i.e., counter-clockwise to clockwise and vice versa. Our observations regarding speed regulation, the gap between rotor and stator, and the flagellar switching due to the activity of cytoplasmic proteins, indicate that the bacterial flagellar motor uses the same mechanism as that of an electric motor.

Previously, we found that the targetable histone methyltransferase EZH2 was upregulated in aggressive BCC subtypes, suggesting that epigenetics may play a role in BCC progression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EZH2-associated proteins and marks may be employed for the stratification of BCC histologic subtypes.\\n\\nMETHODS: Sixty-two specimens (from 61 patients), representing more or less aggressive BCC histologic subtypes and matching non-malignant epidermal cells, were included in this study. Immunohistochemistry of H3K27me3, 5hmC, NSD2, MOF and JARID1B was performed to assess their putative associations with BCC histologic subtypes, as well as with EZH2 and Ki67 expression levels.\\n\\nRESULTS: We found that H3K27me3 and 5hmC upregulation was positively correlated with the occurrence of a less aggressive BCC histology. The modifications were also positively correlated with each other. Interestingly, we found that they were negatively correlated with the expression of EZH2, a marker for an aggressive BCC histology. The levels of NSD2, MOF, H3K27me3 and 5hmC were found to be universally upregulated in BCCs versus non-malignant epidermal cells.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal an EZH2-associated epigenetic marker profile that correlates with histologic signs of BCC aggressiveness. Our findings may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications, and indicate that epigenetic markers may be shared even with relatively less aggressive tumor types, thereby suggesting universal themes.'\n",

Much of the focus on potential \"quantum biology\" has been on energy transfer processes in photosynthetic light harvesting systems. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy of several light harvesting proteins has uncovered coherent oscillations dubbed \"quantum beats\" that persist for hundreds of femtoseconds and are putative signatures for quantum transport phenomena. This review describes the language and basic quantum mechanical phenomena that underpin quantum transport in open systems such as light harvesting and photosynthetic proteins, including the photosystem reaction centre. Coherent effects are discussed in detail, separating various meanings of the term, from delocalized excitations, or excitons, to entangled states and coherent transport. In particular, we focus on the time, energy and length scales of energy transport processes, as these are critical in understanding whether or not coherent processes are important. The role played by the protein in maintaining chromophore systems is analysed. Finally, the spectroscopic techniques that are used to probe energy transfer dynamics and that have uncovered the quantum beats are described with reference to coherent phenomena in light harvesting.'\n"

Kinesins are anterograde microtubule-based motor proteins that are involved in trafficking of receptors including nociceptors and progression of pain. The specific kinesin and regulatory proteins interplay is crucial for the delivery of nociceptors to the synapse. If this complex and less understood interplay is inhibited, it may result in a decrease in central sensitization, and thus attenuation of pain. This review is focused on the transportation process of receptors/cargos, the role of regulatory proteins influencing the respective kinesin, and their relationship with chronic pain. The review also features specific strategies adopted by researchers for targeting kinesin and chronic pain. Considering the recent preclinical success of kinesin inhibition in pain, it is expected that inhibitors for kinesin or enzymes responsible for kinesin activation could be developed or repurposed as alternative, safe, and potential therapies for the treatment of chronic pain.'\n",

Several glycoproteins of T. solium and Taenia crassiceps cysticerci have been characterized and studied for their use in the immunodiagnosis of neurocysticercosis and/or the development of synthetic or recombinant vaccines against cysticercosis. The aim of this study was to perform a gel-free shotgun proteomic analysis to identify saline vesicular extract (SVE) proteins of T. solium and T. crassiceps cysticerci. After solubilization of the SVE with and without surfactant reagent and in-solution digestion, the proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Use of a surfactant resulted in a significantly higher number of proteins that were able to be identified by LC-MS/MS. Novel proteins were identified in T. solium and T. crassiceps SVE. The qualitative analysis revealed a total of 79 proteins in the Taenia species: 29 in T. solium alone, 11 in T. crassiceps alone, and 39 in both. These results are an important contribution to support future investigations and for establishing a Taenia proteomic profile to study candidate biomarkers involved in the diagnosis or pathogenesis of neurocysticercosis.'\n",

Sellecting an efficient yeast producer and designing culture conditions are a prerequisite for obtaining high yield of β-glucan. The aim of this study was to describe at the first time the influence of the mode of cultivation (shake-flasks and batch fermentation) and time of culture on characteristic and yield of biomass and β(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan preparations of Candida utilis ATCC 9950 after cultivation in medium based on waste potato juice water supplemented with 10% of glycerol. After shake-flask culture, the biomass was characterized by higher protein content (app. 26.5%) compared to 19% after batch fermentation while the cultivation on a biofermentor scale promoted polysaccharides biosynthesis. The highest output of purified β(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan preparation (5.3\\xa0g/L), containing app. 85% of that polysaccharide, was found after 48\\xa0h cultivation in biofermentor. Batch fermentation promoted biosynthesis of alkali-insoluble β(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan fraction, decreasing the content of β(1,6)-glucan. The yield of β(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan synthesis was 0.063 (g/g glycerol), while the productivity of that polysaccharide reached 0.094 (g/L/h). Longer batch fermentation (72\\xa0h) resulted in reduction of production efficiency of β-glucan preparation under studied conditions. The results of the study provide a new efficient biotechnological solution to produce high-value β-glucan preparations of C. utilis origin based on valorization of agro-waste potato juice water with glycerol.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Biodegradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) (rubber) by Gram-negative bacteria has been investigated on the enzymatic level only in Steroidobacter cummioxidans 35Y (previously Xanthomonas sp. 35Y). This species produces two kinds of rubber oxygenases, RoxA and RoxB, one of which (RoxB) cleaves polyisoprene to a mixture of C- and higher oligoisoprenoids while the other (RoxA) cleaves polyisoprene and RoxB-derived oligoisoprenoids to the C-oligoisoprenoid 12-oxo-4,8-dimethyltrideca-4,8-diene-1-al (ODTD). ODTD can be taken up by S. cummioxidans and used as a carbon source. Gram-positive rubber-degrading bacteria employ another type of rubber oxygenase, latex clearing protein (Lcp), for the initial oxidative attack of the polyisoprene molecule. In this contribution, we examined which type of rubber oxygenase is present in the only other well-documented Gram-negative rubber-degrading species, Rhizobacter gummiphilus NS21. No homologue for an Lcp protein but homologues for a putative RoxA and a RoxB protein (the latter identical to a previously postulated LatA-denominated rubber cleaving enzyme) were identified in the genome of strain NS21. The roxA and roxB genes were separately expressed in a ∆roxA/∆roxB background of S. cummioxidans 35Y and restored the ability of the mutant to produce oligoisoprenoids. The RoxA and RoxB proteins were each purified and biochemically characterised. The results-in combination with in silico analysis of databases-indicate that Gram-negative rubber-degrading bacteria generally utilise two synergistically acting rubber oxygenases (RoxA/RoxB) for efficient cleavage of polyisoprene to ODTD.'\n",

The relationships of these polymorphisms with clinical outcomes such as acute rejection, acute nephrotoxicity, pneumonia, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were explored. For the FKBP1A rs6041749 polymorphism, which has a significant association with renal function over time, a preliminary functional analysis was performed using a dual-luciferase reporter gene system.\\n\\nRESULTS: The patients with FKBP1A rs6041749 TT genotype had a more stable eGFR level than CC and CT carriers (P\\u2009=\\u20092.08\\u2009×\\u200910) during the 2\\xa0years following transplantation. Dual-luciferase reporter assay results showed that the rs6041749 C variant could enhance the relative luciferase activity compared with the T variant, which indicated that the rs6041749 C allele may increase the FKBP1A gene transcription. In addition, we did not find any association between these genetic variants and the risk of acute rejection, acute nephrotoxicity, and pneumonia in renal transplant patients receiving TAC-based immunosuppression.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: FKBP1A rs6041749 C allele carriers are at higher risk for eGFR deterioration.

In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to deliver different types of RNA NPs functionalized with dicer substrate RNAs inside human cells. Our results show that use of functionalized RNA NPs result in statistically higher transfection efficiency compared to the use of RNA duplexes. Furthermore, we show that the nucleic acids in the MNP/RNA NP complexes are protected from nuclease degradation and that they can achieve knockdown of target protein expression, which is amplified by magnetic stimulus.

      "Abstract :'Retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor γt (RORγt) controls the transcription of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), which plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Severity of several human autoimmune diseases is correlated with frequencies of germinal center kinase-like kinase (GLK) (also known as MAP4K3)-overexpressing T cells; however, the mechanism of GLK overexpression-induced autoimmunity remains unclear. We report the signal transduction converging on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-RORγt interaction to activate transcription of the IL-17A gene in T cells. T cell-specific GLK transgenic mice spontaneously developed autoimmune diseases with selective induction of IL-17A in T cells. In GLK transgenic T cells, protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) phosphorylated AhR at Ser and induced AhR nuclear translocation. AhR also interacted with RORγt and transported RORγt into the nucleus. IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase β)-mediated RORγt Ser phosphorylation induced the AhR-RORγt interaction. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling also induced the novel RORγt phosphorylation and subsequent AhR-RORγt interaction. Collectively, TCR signaling or GLK overexpression induces IL-17A transcription through the IKKβ-mediated RORγt phosphorylation and the AhR-RORγt interaction in T cells. Our findings suggest that inhibitors of GLK or the AhR-RORγt complex could be used as IL-17A-blocking agents for IL-17A-mediated autoimmune diseases.'\n"

      "Abstract :\"Ammonium is an important nitrogen (N) source for living organisms, a key metabolite for pH control, and a potent cytotoxic compound. Ammonium is transported by the widespread AMT-Mep-Rh membrane proteins, and despite their significance in physiological processes, the nature of substrate translocation (NH/NH) by the distinct members of this family is still a matter of controversy. Using  cells expressing representative AMT-Mep-Rh ammonium carriers and taking advantage of the natural chemical-physical property of the N isotopic signature linked to NH/NH conversion, this study shows that only cells expressing AMT-Mep-Rh proteins were depleted in N relative to N when compared to the external ammonium source. We observed N depletion over a wide range of external pH, indicating its independence of NH formation in solution. On the basis of inhibitor studies, ammonium transport by nonspecific cation channels did not show isotope fractionation but competition with K. We propose that kinetic N isotope fractionation is a common feature of AMT-Mep-Rh-type proteins, which favor N over N, owing to the dissociation of NH into NH + H in the protein, leading to N depletion in the cell and allowing NH passage or NH/H cotransport. This deprotonation mechanism explains these proteins' essential functions in environments under a low NH/K ratio, allowing organisms to specifically scavenge NH. We show that N isotope fractionation may be used in vivo not only to determine the molecular species being transported by ammonium transport proteins, but also to track ammonium toxicity and associated amino acids excretion.\"\n",

However, modifying positive-strand RNA virus proteins in the context of viral infection can be particularly difficult as their compact genomes and multifunctional proteins mean even small changes can inactivate or attenuate the virus. Although targeted approaches to functionally tag viral proteins have been successful, these approaches are time consuming and inefficient. A strategy that has been successfully applied to several RNA viruses is whole-genome transposon insertional mutagenesis. A library of viral genomes, each containing a single randomly placed small insertion, is selected by passaging in cell culture and the insertion sites can be identified using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Here we describe a protocol for transposon mutagenesis of the 16681 strain of dengue virus, serotype 2. Mutant dengue virus libraries containing short randomly placed insertions are passaged through mammalian cells and insertions are mapped by NGS of the viable progeny. The protocol is divided into four stages: transposon mutagenesis of a dengue cDNA clone, viral genome transfection into permissive cells, isolation of viral progeny genomes, and sequencing library preparation.'\n",

As a consequence, alterations of their homeostasis may lead to many complex pathological disorders, such as neurodegeneration and cancer. For many of these proteins, however, their exact function and cellular targets are still not very well known. Here, we focused the attention on two hnRNP family members, hnRNP Q and hnRNP R, that we previously found affecting TDP-43 activity both in Drosophila melanogaster and human neuronal cell line. Classification of these two human proteins as paralogs is suported by the high level of sequence homology and by the observation that in fly they correspond to the same protein, namely Syp. We profiled differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq and generated functional enrichment results after silencing of hnRNP Q and hnRNP R in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Interestingly, despite their high sequence similarity, these two proteins were found to affect different cellular pathways, especially with regards to neurodegeneration, such as PENK, NGR3, RAB26, JAG1, as well as inflammatory response, such as TNF, ICAM1, ICAM5, and TNFRSF9. In conclusion, human hnRNP Q and hnRNP R may be considered potentially important regulators of neuronal homeostasis and their disruption could impair distinct pathways in the central nervous system axis, thus confirming the importance of their conservation during evolution.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The encapsulation of small molecule drugs in nanomaterials has become an increasingly popular approach to the delivery of therapeutics. The use of emulsions as templates for the synthesis of drug impregnated nanomaterials is an exciting area of research, and a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the interfacial chemistry that is critical to controlling the physicochemical properties of both the encapsulated material and the templated material. For example, control of the interfacial tension between an oil and aqueous phase is a fundamental concern when designing drug delivery vehicles that are stabilized by particulate surfactants at the fluid interface. Particles in general are capable of self-assembly at a fluid interface, with a preference for one or the other of the phases, and much work has focussed on modification of the particle properties to optimize formation and stability of the emulsion. An issue arises however when a model, single oil system is translated into more complex, real-world scenarios, which are often multi-component, with the incorporation of charged active ingredients and other excipients. The result is potentially a huge change in the properties of the dispersed phase which can lead to a failure in the capability of particles to continue to stabilize the interface. In this mini-review, we will focus on two encapsulation strategies based on the selective deposition of particles or proteins on a fluid-fluid interface: virus-like particles and polymer microcapsules formed from particle-stabilized emulsion templates. The similarity between these colloidal systems lies in the fact that particulate entities are used to stabilize fluid cores. We will focus on those studies that have described the effect of subtle changes in core composition on the self-assembly of particles at the fluid-fluid interface and how this influences the resulting capsule structure.'\n",

Impairment of both alleles of  is thought to be a rare event, only occurring in a few cancer cell lines. How is the tumor suppressor function of WWOX impaired in cancer cells? Recent advances highlight that a small transmembrane protein possessing a PPxY motif, called TMEM207, and its relatives are aberrantly expressed in various cancer cells and hinder the tumor suppressor function of WWOX through inhibiting its WW domain.

The first form, GAK_1, has one gefitinib at the ATP binding pocket, whereas the second form, GAK_2, binds one each in the ATP binding site and a novel binding site adjacent to the activation segment C-terminal helix, a unique element of the Numb-associated kinase family. In the novel binding site, gefitinib binds in the hydrophobic groove around the activation segment, disrupting the conserved hydrogen bonds for the catalytic activity.

While the precise mechanism underlying activation of the ALT pathway is unclear, mutations in the chromatin remodeling protein ATRX, histone chaperone DAXX, and the histone variant H3.3 correlate with ALT status. ATRX and DAXX facilitate deposition of the histone variant H3.3 within heterochromatic regions suggesting that loss of ATRX, DAXX, and/or H3.3 lead to defects in the stability of telomeric heterochromatin. Genetic mutations in ATRX, DAXX, and H3.3 have been detected in ALT positive cancers, however, a subset of ALT samples show loss of ATRX or DAXX protein expression or localization without evidence of genetic alterations suggesting additional uncharacterized defects in ATRX/DAXX/H3.3 function. Here, using Next Generation Sequencing we identified a novel gene fusion event between DAXX and the kinesin motor protein, KIFC3, leading to the translation of a chimeric DAXX-KIFC3 fusion protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that the fusion of KIFC3 to DAXX causes defects in DAXX function likely promoting ALT activity.

Elevated plasma TSLP concentration was associated with shorter overall survival and increased risk of poor outcome.

Here we introduce the multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance (MP-SPR) approach to quantify SLF binding and effect on the self-association of the peptide via a label-free, real-time approach. Kinetic analysis of SLF binding to Aβ and measurements of layer thickness alterations inform on the mechanism underlying the ability of SLF to inhibit Aβ toxicity and its progression towards larger oligomeric assemblies. Depending on the oligomeric state of Aβ, distinct binding affinities for SLF are revealed. The Aβ monomer and dimer uniquely possess sub-nanomolar affinity for SLF via a non-specific mode of binding. SLF binding is weaker in oligomeric Aβ, which displays an affinity for SLF on the order of 100 μM. To complement these experiments we carried out molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to explore how SLF interacts with the Aβ peptide. The MP-SPR results together with  modeling provide affinity data for the SLF-Aβ interaction and allow us to develop a new general method for examining protein aggregation.\"\n",

Time zero was set to September 30, 2010, and survival rates were analyzed by landmarking. Cumulative survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared according to grades using the log-rank test; contributing factors to survival were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Pretreatment factors were analyzed for 109 TACE sessions performed until October 2017, using a multiple logistic regression model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the best tumor number for predicting response P.\\n\\nResults: Response P patients showed significantly lower cumulative survival rates than Response NP patients (P < 0.001).

It is a significant endogenous defensive molecule that responds to harmful stimuli, such as cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, and, neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Cerebral ischemia, which results from insufficient blood flow or the blockage of blood vessels, is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has received increased attention due to its '3H' effects, namely high mortality, high morbidity, and high disability. Numerous studies have revealed that activation of AMPK plays a protective role in the brain, whereas its action in ischemic stroke remains elusive and poorly understood. Based on existing evidence, we introduce the basic structure, upstream regulators, and biological roles of AMPK. Second, we analyze the relationship between AMPK and the neurovascular unit (NVU).

      "Abstract :'An increased risk of cardiovascular death in Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected individuals remains unexplained, although it might partly result from the fact that CMV infection is closely associated with the accumulation of CD28 T-cells, in particular CD28 CD4 T-cells. These cells can directly damage endothelium and precipitate cardiovascular events. However, the current paradigm holds that the accumulation of CD28 T-cells is a normal consequence of aging, whereas the link between these T-cell populations and CMV infection is explained by the increased prevalence of this infection in older people. Resolving whether CMV infection or aging triggers CD28 T-cell expansions is of critical importance because, unlike aging, CMV infection can be treated.  We used multi-color flow-cytometry, antigen-specific activation assays, and HLA-typing to dissect the contributions of CMV infection and aging to the accumulation of CD28 CD4 and CD8 T-cells in CMV+ and CMV- individuals aged 19 to 94 years. Linear/logistic regression was used to test the effect of sex, age, CMV infection, and HLA-type on CD28 T-cell frequencies.  The median frequencies of CD28 CD4 T-cells and CD28 CD8 T-cells were >12-fold (p=0.000) but only approximately 2-fold higher (p=0.000), respectively, in CMV+ (n=136) compared with CMV- individuals (n=106). The effect of CMV infection on these T-cell subsets was confirmed by linear regression. Unexpectedly, aging contributed only marginally to an increase in CD28 T-cell frequencies, and only in CMV+ individuals. Interestingly, the presence of HLA-DRB1*0301 led to an approximately 9-fold reduction of the risk of having CD28 CD4 T-cell expansions (OR=0.108, p=0.003). Over 75% of CMV-reactive CD4 T-cells were CD28.  CMV infection and HLA type are major risk factors for CD28 CD4 T-cell-associated cardiovascular pathology. Increased numbers of CD28 CD8 T-cells are also associated with CMV infection, but to a lesser extent. Aging, however, makes only a negligible contribution to the expansion of these T-cell subsets, and only in the presence of CMV infection. Our results open up new avenues for risk assessment, prevention, and treatment.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Molecular networks in neurological diseases are complex. Despite this fact, contemporary biomarkers are in most cases interpreted in isolation, leading to a significant loss of information and power. We present an analytical approach to scrutinize and combine information from biomarkers originating from multiple sources with the aim of discovering a condensed set of biomarkers that in combination could distinguish the progressive degenerative phenotype of multiple sclerosis (SPMS) from the relapsing-remitting phenotype (RRMS).  Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were integrated with data from protein and metabolite measurements of cerebrospinal fluid, and a method was developed to sift through all the variables to establish a small set of highly informative measurements. This prospective study included 16 SPMS patients, 30 RRMS patients and 10 controls. Protein concentrations were quantitated with multiplexed fluorescent bead-based immunoassays and ELISA. The metabolome was recorded using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical follow-up data of the SPMS patients were used to assess disease progression and development of disability.  Eleven variables were in combination able to distinguish SPMS from RRMS patients with high confidence superior to any single measurement. The identified variables consisted of three MRI variables: the size of the spinal cord and the third ventricle and the total number of T1 hypointense lesions; six proteins: galectin-9, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA); and two metabolites: 20β-dihydrocortisol (20β-DHF) and indolepyruvate. The proteins myelin basic protein (MBP) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), as well as the metabolites 20β-DHF and 5,6-dihydroxyprostaglandin F1a (5,6-DH-PGF), were identified as potential biomarkers of disability progression.  Our study demonstrates, in a limited but well-defined and data-rich cohort, the importance and value of combining multiple biomarkers to aid diagnostics and track disease progression.'\n"

Molecular imaging of VEGFR2 expression may enable patient stratification for antiangiogenic therapy. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the capacity of the novel anti-VEGFR2 biparatopic affibody conjugate (Z-Bp) for in vivo visualization of VEGFR2 expression in GBM.  Z-Bp coupled to a NODAGA chelator was generated and radiolabeled with indium-111.

Further tumor targeting was studied in vivo in GL261 glioblastoma orthotopic tumors. Experimental imaging was performed.  [In]In-NODAGA-Z-Bp bound specifically to VEGFR2 (K=33±18 pM). VEGFR2-mediated accumulation was observed in liver, spleen and lungs. The tumor-to-organ ratios 2 h post injection for mice bearing MS1 tumors were approximately 11 for blood, 15 for muscles and 78 for brain. Intracranial GL261 glioblastoma was visualized using SPECT/CT. The activity uptake in tumors was significantly higher than in normal brain tissue. The tumor-to-cerebellum ratios after injection of 4 µg [In]In-NODAGA-Z-Bp were significantly higher than the ratios observed for the 40 µg injected dose and for the non-VEGFR2 binding size-matched conjugate, demonstrating target specificity. Microautoradiography of cryosectioned CNS tissue was in good agreement with the SPECT/CT images.  The anti-VEGFR2 affibody conjugate [In]In-NODAGA-Z-Bp specifically targeted VEGFR2 in vivo and visualized its expression in a murine GBM orthotopic model. Tumor-to-blood ratios for [In]In-NODAGA-Z-Bp were higher compared to other VEGFR2 imaging probes. [In]In-NODAGA-Z-Bp appears to be a promising probe for in vivo noninvasive visualization of tumor angiogenesis in glioblastoma.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been proposed as a key driving force of tumor growth and relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC), and therefore, they are promising targets for cancer therapy. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that the daily use of aspirin reduces overall mortality of CRC and the risk of distant metastasis. We investigated the effect and mechanism of aspirin on CSCs in CRC.  The ratio of CSCs was analyzed after aspirin treatment both in a cell model and patient samples. Chemically modified aspirin and immunoprecipitation were adopted to detect the target proteins of aspirin. A locus-specific light-inducible epigenetic modification system based on CRISPR technology was constructed to verify the causal relationship in these molecular events. In vivo characterization was performed in a xenograft model.  We found that aspirin induces apoptosis in enriched colorectal CSCs, inhibits tumor progression, and enhances the anti-neoplastic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, aspirin directly interacts with p300 in the nucleus, promotes H3K9 acetylation, activates  expression, and induces apoptosis in colorectal CSCs. Notably, these effects of aspirin are absent in non-CSCs since H3K9 is hypermethylated in non-CSCs and the effects are not induced by other NSAIDs. In addition, aspirin can suppress oxaliplatin-enriched CSCs and serve as an adjuvant therapy.  Taken together, we revealed a unique epigenetic and cox-independent pathway (p300-AcH3K9-FasL axis) by which aspirin eliminates colorectal CSCs. These findings establish an innovative framework of the therapeutic significance of aspirin.'\n",

According to Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)/Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)/Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) analyses, Chi3L1 is associated with 38 cancers, and more highly associated with cancer compared to other oncogenes such as EGFR, TNFα, etc. However, the mechanisms and pathways by which Chi3L1 is associated with cancer are not clear. In current study, we investigated the role of Chi3L1 in lung metastasis.  We performed the differentially expressed gene analysis to explore the genes which are associated with Chi3L1 using the web-based platform from Biomart. We investigated the metastases in lung tissues of C57BL/6 mice injected with B16F10 melanoma following treatment with Ad-shChi3L1. We also investigated the expression of USF1 and Chi3L1 in Chi3L1 KD mice lung tissues by Western blotting and IHC. We also analyzed lung cancer cells metastases induced by Chi3L1 using migration and cell proliferation assay in human lung cancer cell lines. The involvement of miR-125a-3p in Chi3L1 regulation was determined by miRNA qPCR and luciferase reporter assay.  We showed that melanoma metastasis in lung tissues was significantly reduced in Chi3L1 knock-down mice, accompanied by down-regulation of MMP-9, MMP-13, VEGF, and PCNA in Chi3L1 knock-down mice lung tissue, as well as in human lung cancer cell lines. We also found that USF1 was conversely expressed against Chi3L1. USF1 was increased by knock-down of Chi3L1 in mice lung tissues, as well as in human lung cancer cell lines. In addition, knock-down of USF1 increased Chi3L1 levels in addition to augmenting metastasis cell migration and proliferation in mice model, as well as in human cancer cell lines. Moreover, in human lung tumor tissues, the expression of Chi3L1 was increased but USF1 was decreased in a stage-dependent manner. Finally, Chi3L1 expression was strongly regulated by the indirect translational suppressing activity of USF1 through induction of miR-125a-3p, a target of Chi3L1.  Metastases in mice lung tissues and human lung cancer cell lines were decreased by KD of Chi3L1. USF1 bound to the Chi3L1 promoter, however, Chi3L1 expression was decreased by USF1, despite USF1 enhancing the transcriptional activity of Chi3L1. We found that USF1 induced miR-125a-3p levels which suppressed Chi3L1 expression. Ultimately, our results suggest that lung metastasis is suppressed by knock-down of Chi3L1 through miR-125a-3p-mediated up-regulation of USF1.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Neoadjuvant treatment options for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-enriched and luminal B molecular subtypes of clinical breast cancer include HER-2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy or anti-hormonal therapy. These treatment options result in systemic toxicity and acquired tumor resistance. Minimally toxic naturally occurring phytochemicals may represent testable alternatives to conventional therapy. HER-2-overexpressing tumorigenic human mammary epithelial 184-B5/HER cells represent a model for the HER-2-enriched breast cancer subtype. Non-fractionated rosemary extract (RME) and constituent phenolic terpenoids ursolic acid (UA), carnosol (CSOL) and carnosic acid (CA) represented the test agents. Anchorage-independent (AI) proliferation, cell cycle progression, cellular apoptosis and expression of cell cycle-regulatory and apoptosis-specific proteins represented the mechanistic end point biomarkers. Relative to the parental non-tumorigenic 184-B5 cells, tumorigenic 184-B5/HER cells exhibited decreased population doubling, increased saturation density, accelerated cell cycle progression and downregulated cellular apoptosis, confirming the loss of homeostatic control of proliferation. Treatment with the test agents resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in AI colony number, indicating a decrease in cancer risk. Mechanistically, RME and UA inhibited G-S phase transition resulting in an increased G:S+G/M ratio and decreased cyclin D1 expression. The pro-apoptotic effect of RME and UA was indicated by increased sub-G (apoptotic) cell population, and relevant reciprocal modulation, as demonstrated by decreased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and increased pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein expression. In contrast, treatment with CA and CSOL resulted in cytostatic G/M arrest and an increase in cyclin B1 expression; thus, naturally-occurring rosemary and its constitutive terpenoids re-establish homeostatic control of proliferation and decrease cancer risk via distinct mechanisms. These data validate an experimental approach to prioritize efficacious natural compounds as testable alternatives for conventional chemo-endocrine and HER-2-targeted therapies in HER-2-enriched breast cancer.'\n"

      "Abstract :'The adenoma-carcinoma sequence, the sequential mutation and deletion of various genes by which colorectal cancer progresses, is a well-established and accepted concept of colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Proteins of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) function as transcriptional repressors by trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 27; the activity of this complex is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an essential component of PRC2, is associated with the transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. EZH2 expression has previously been reported to increase with the progression of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Thus, we hypothesized that EZH2 expression also increases during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of colorectal cancer. The present study investigated changes in EZH2 expression during the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence. A total of 47 patients with colorectal adenoma, 20 patients with carcinoma in adenoma and 43 patients with colorectal carcinoma who underwent surgical or endoscopic resection were enrolled in this study. Non-cancerous tissue from the clinical specimens was also examined. The association between EZH2 expression, pathology and expression of tumor suppressor genes during colorectal carcinogenesis were analyzed. Each specimen was immunohistochemically stained for EZH2, proliferation marker protein Ki-67 (Ki-67), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN) 1A (p21), CDKN1B (p27) and CDKN2A (p16). Total RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of these genes was performed. Ki-67 and EZH2 expression scores increased significantly during the progression of normal mucosa to adenoma and carcinoma (P=0.009), and EZH2 expression score was positively associated with Ki-67 expression score (P=0.02). Conversely, p21 mRNA and protein expression decreased significantly, whereas expression of p27 and p16 did not change significantly. During the carcinogenesis sequence from normal mucosa to adenoma and carcinoma, EZH2 expression increased and p21 expression decreased significantly. EZH2 may therefore contribute to the development of colorectal cancer from adenoma via suppression of p21.'\n",

These pathways are implicated in a variety of types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of IRE1α-XBP1 signaling in the development of HCC remains unclear. In the current study, reverse transcription-quantiative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression levels of  and interleukin ( in human tissues and cells. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were utilized to investigate the interaction between XBP1s and  promoter DNA. It was revelaed that IRE1α-XBP1 signaling promotes the proliferation of HCC cells via regulating hepatic IL-6 expression. It was observed that the splicing levels of XBP1 and hepatic IL-6 content were increased and positively correlated with each other in human HCC tissues (r=0.5846, P=0.004). Ectopic expression of IRE1α or XBP1s increased IL-6 levels in LO2 and Hep3B cells. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α reduced the levels of IL-6 expression and secretion through blocking the generation of XBP1s, which bound directly to the IL-6 promoter and activated its expression. Further investigation demonstrated that IL-6 driven by XBP1s was secreted outside of cells and activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in an autocrine/paracrine manner, to regulate the proliferation of Hep3B cells. Blockage of IL-6-STAT3 signaling with tocilizumab attenuated the effect of IRE1α-XBP1 signaling in promoting Hep3B cell proliferation. In conclusion, the present study revealed that IRE1α-XBP1 signaling promotes carcinogenesis of HCC by regulating the activation of the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Chaetominine is a cytotoxic alkaloid that has been demonstrated to promote apoptotic cell death in human leukemia K562 cells. In the present study, chaetominine inhibited K562 (IC 34 nM) and SW1116 (IC 46 nM) cell growth. However, it remains unclear whether the inhibition of cell growth is associated with the cell cycle. To assess this potential relationship, the effect of chaetominine on the cell cycle of K562 and SW1116 cells was examined. Chaetominine treatment caused cell apoptosis and G-phase arrest in SW1116 cells. Conversely, K562 cells underwent S-phase arrest according to flow cytometric analysis. The present study also aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning cell cycle regulation following the incubation of the associated cells with chaetominine. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses suggested that chaetominine treatment facilitated the expression of p53, p21, checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM) and caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2 and 4. These results suggest that chaetominine may be involved in the regulation of p53/p21 and ATM and Rad3-related (ATM)/Chk2 signaling in SW1116 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that these signaling pathways are responsible for G-phase arrest. Results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of p-ATR and Chk1 were increased in K562 cells. Additionally, cdc25A levels were decreased, while protein and gene expression levels of cyclin A and CDK2 were repressed. These results elucidated the role of chaetominine in in the regulation of ATR/cdc25A/Chk1 expression in K562 cells. These proteins are thus important determinants in the initiation of S-phase arrest. These data support the hypothesis that chaetominine is a potential anti-cancer therapeutic agent that targets the cell cycle.'\n",

The tumor tissues, para-carcinoma tissues and associated clinical data of 36 patients with NSCLC were collected in order to detect the expression of CCAT2 and assess the impact of factors including histopathological type, Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage and lymph node metastasis on CCAT2 expression. The lung cancer NCI-H1975 cell line was transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) plasmid to determine the effect of si-CCAT2 on NSCLC proliferation, invasion and metastasis. The effect of si-CCAT2 on the expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin protein in the lung cancer NCI-H1975 cell line was detected using western blot analysis. The expression levels of CCAT2 in the tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than those in the normal para-carcinoma tissues (t=8.580, P<0.01). Subsequent to CCAT2 silencing, the proliferation and invasive abilities of NCI-H1975 cells were significantly decreased compared with control cells (P<0.05). In the si-CCAT2 group, the level of nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin proteins was decreased, and the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway was significantly inhibited compared with the control cells (P<0.01), and a synergistic effect was exerted with the Wnt signaling inhibitor FH535.

The development of acquired drug resistance is the leading cause of chemotherapy failure. To study the mechanism underlying drug resistance in ovarian cancer, a drug-resistant ovarian cancer SKOV3 cell line was developed using the chemotherapeutic agent carboplatin (SKOV3-Carb) in the present study. It has been reported that high-mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB1) is associated with the chemoresistance of tumor cells. Therefore, the probable involvement of HMGB1 in the development of carboplatin resistance in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells was investigated. HMGB1 has been reported to be overexpressed in carboplatin-resistant SKOV3-Carb cells compared with control SKOV3 cells. Subsequently, the expression of HMGB1 was silenced by small interference RNA technology. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis indicated that mRNA and protein expression levels of HMGB1 were significantly inhibited in HMGB1-silenced cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of HMGB1 silencing on resistant ovarian cancer cells. An MTT assay revealed that the proliferation of HMGB1-silenced SKOV3 and SKOV3-Carb cells were decreased compared with the proliferation of non-silenced control cells. Additionally, HMGB1 protein expression levels in SKOV3 cells, but not in SKOV3-Carb cells, were decreased in response to carboplatin treatment. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that HMGB1 silencing enhanced the effects of carboplatin in inducing the apoptosis of SKOV3-Carb cells relative to HMGB1 non-silenced control cells. The results of the present study suggested that HMGB1 may be involved in the development of carboplatin resistance in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells and that HMGB1 silencing may induce the sensitization of carboplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin. Therefore, HMGB1 may be considered as a potent therapeutic target for increasing the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin in order to improve the treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer.'\n"

The use of these agents in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents is usually associated with adverse effects. In the present study, a combination of celecoxib and bortezomib was investigated for potential synergistic effects in colon cancer cells. The sequential exposure to celecoxib with bortezomib synergistically induced apoptotic death in human colon cancer cells compared with groups treated with a single drug or other drug combinations. c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through serial exposure to celecoxib and bortezomib may have induced the intracellular Ca release, leading to the generation of autophagosomes in p53-expressing HCT-116 cells. Targeted inhibition of p53 activity or ER stress or treatment with the Ca-chelating agent BAPTA-AM suppressed the ER stress-mediated Ca release and apoptosis. Although p53 HCT-116 cells were less sensitive to sequential treatment with celecoxib and bortezomib, co-localization of autophagosomes was detected in the absence of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein expression. Treatment of p53 HCT-116 cells with BAPTA-AM did not inhibit apoptosis following serial treatment with celecoxib and bortezomib. These results suggest that the order of drug administration is important in treating cancer and that the sequential treatment with celecoxib and bortezomib enhances the ER stress-mediated autophagy-associated cell death of colon cancer cells, regardless of p53 expression.'\n",

Expression level of H19, and its association with clinicopathological features and overall survival was analyzed. It was found that compared with normal adjacent tissues, H19 expression was elevated in NSCLC tissues along with a decreased miR-203 expression level. It was also found that patients who were in advanced clinical stages had a higher H19 and a lower miR-203 expression compared to normal tissues. The overall survival time of patients with higher H19 expression was shorter compared with the lower H19 expression group. Upregulation of A549 enhanced cell proliferation and promoted invasion. Overexpression of H19 stimulated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in lung cancer cells and demonstrated typical morphological characteristics of EMT. The level of mesenchymal marker protein, such as Vimentin and SNAI1 increased; while CDH1 protein level decreased. Also, H19 negatively regulated miR-203.

The importance of angiogenesis in the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in HCC is well established. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of osthole on angiogenesis in an orthotopic mouse model of HCC. Orthotopic HCC in mice was established, and osthole at 61, 122 and 244 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally once daily to the tumor-bearing mice for 14 consecutive days. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the microvessel density (MVD) of tissues, and the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was measured by ELISA. The protein levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and IκB-α were also detected by western blotting. MVD was positively correlated with tumor weight in the orthotopic mouse model of HCC. Osthole administration significantly decreased MVD in tumor and adjacent tissues, and inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, osthole downregulated the expression of VEGF and NF-κB p65, and upregulated IκB-α expression in tumor and adjacent tissues. To the best of our knowledge, the results of the present study demonstrated for the first time that osthole inhibits angiogenesis in an orthotopic mouse model of HCC, which may be one of the mechanisms underlying the anti-HCC activity of osthole, which in turn may be mediated by the NF-κB/VEGF signaling pathway. Therefore, osthole, a potential angiogenesis inhibitor and immune system enhancer, may be a promising lead compound for the treatment of HCC.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Gastric cancer is an intractable disease with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Its treatment remains a major clinical challenge worldwide. Ephrin-B2 is upregulated and involved in tumor growth in various types of cancer. However, the association between ephrin-B2 and prognosis of gastric cancer, and the potential of ephrin-B2 as a therapeutic target remains unknown. The present study investigated ephrin-B2 as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for gastric cancer. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the protein expression level of ephrin-B2 in gastric cancer serum samples (n=162) and healthy serum samples (n=165). It was revealed that the protein expression level of ephrin-B2 was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer serum samples compared with the healthy samples. Ephrin-B2 protein expression was associated with tumor size (P<0.001), metastasis (P=0.02) and TNM stage (P=0.03), and was indicated to be an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated that patients with high ephrin-B2 protein expression had shorter overall and progression-free survival rates than those with low ephrin-B2 protein expression. Ephrin-B2 protein expression was induced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection of HGC27 and MKN-45 cells, significantly impeding cell viability and inducing apoptosis of HGC27 and MKN-45 cells compared with the respective negative control (NC) group. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, the present study indicates that ephrin-B2 functions as an oncogene in gastric cancer, and that serum ephrin-B2 level may be a promising non-invasive prognostic indicator, as well as a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Immune checkpoints in solid tumors serve important roles in metastasis. The present study was designed to explore the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on peripheral blood T-cell subsets and its role in the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The expression of PD-1 in peripheral blood T-cell subsets was detected in 100 metastatic gastric cancer patients prior to the first line chemotherapy by flow cytometric analysis. The potential associaton between the peripheral blood T-cell subsets PD-1 level and the clinicopathological features of patients with metastatic gastric cancer and the clinical outcomes was analyzed. The percent of high PD-1 expressed cluster of differentiation (CD)3, CD3CD4 and CD3CD8 T-cells was 20.4, 13.0 and 9.4%, respectively in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rate of the 100 patients with metastatic gastric cancer was 12.2 and 3.9 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curve with long-rank analysis indicated that patients with higher PD-1/CD3, PD-1/CD3CD4 and PD-1/CD3CD8 levels had a worse prognosis (all P<0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that high PD-1/CD3 [hazard ratio (HR), 2.145; P=0.015], high PD-1/CD3CD4 (HR, 1.866; P=0.034) and high PD-1/CD3CD8 (HR, 1.817; P=0.033) level in peripheral blood were independent risk factors for predicting the survival time of patients with metastatic gastric cancer. High PD-1/CD3, high PD-1/CD3CD4 and high PD-1/CD3CD8 expression conferred a lower overall survival rate in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. These results suggest that high PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T-cell subsets may potentially be novel prognostic biomarker for metastatic gastric cancer.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Microbiota and its induced inflammation in colorectal mucosa have been considered risk factors for the development of colorectal carcinogenesis. Previous studies demonstrated that the coexisting elements of microbiota in the gut, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which exhibited regulatory effects on the intestinal epithelial cells individually. Unfortunately, the association between butyrate and the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway in the development of colon cancer is not fully elucidated. In the present study, by culturing human colon cancer SW480 cells or mouse colon cancer CT26 cells with butyrate and/or TLR4 ligand LPS , it was identified that butyrate suppressed the growth and promoted apoptosis of these cancer cells. Notably, the expression levels of TLR4 and CD14 were markedly increased on these butyrate-treated cells, but not on LPS-alone treated cells. Additionally, butyrate treatment induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, tumor protein 38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65, and then promoted the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, but not interleukin 6 secretion in SW480 and CT26 cells. Therefore, butyrate treatment regulates the expression of TLR4, mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB signal pathway activation and pro-inflammatory response . Although the exact mechanisms have not been fully explored, these results suggested that butyrate and LPS-TLR4 signaling mediated innate immunity in colon cancer cells through two distinct but inter-regulated pathways. Thus, butyrate can further initiate innate immunity against tumor cells by upregulating the TLR4 expression and activation to preserve intestinal homeostasis.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) is an important carcinogen for HBV-induced HCC. When the HBx gene is integrated into the host cell genome, it is difficult to eradicate. The identification of an effective target to inhibit the oncogenic function of HBx is therefore critically important. The present study demonstrated that HBx, particularly truncated HBx, was expressed in several HBV-derived cell lines (e.g., Hep3B and SNU423). By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was revealed that high expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was associated with the process and prognosis of HCC.  experiments confirmed that HBx could regulate the expression of HMGB1 and knockdown of HMGB1 could decrease the ability of HBx to promote cellular proliferation. HBx could also upregulate six transcription factors (GATA binding protein 3, Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3, heat shock transcription factor 1, nuclear factor κB subunit 1, TATA-box binding protein and Kruppel-like factor 4), which could directly regulate HMGB1. By analyzing genes that are co-expressed with HMGB1, several signaling pathways associated with the development of HCC were identified. HBx and HMGB1 were revealed to be involved in these pathways, which may be the mechanism by which HBx promotes HCC by regulating HMGB1. These findings suggested that HMGB1 may be an effective target for inhibiting HBV-induced HCC.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB) is one of the most important tumorigenic factors. Although it has been established that NF-κB is overly activated in human glioma cells, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the signal transduction to NF-κB and thereby the induction of resistance to apoptosis remain poorly understood. The present study demonstrated that mRNA and protein levels of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 2 (MIB2) were markedly upregulated in glioma cell lines and clinical samples. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed high levels of MIB2 expression in glioma specimens. Ectopic overexpression of MIB2 was established in glioma cell lines to investigate its fundamental roles in the response of human glioma to apoptotic inducers. The results indicated that ultraviolet irradiation-induced cell apoptosis was inhibited with MIB2 overexpression in glioma cells. Notably, knockdown of MIB2 using RNA interference was able to increase the sensitivity of glioma cells to the pro-apoptotic agents. The present study identified that MIB2 induces NF-κB activation and facilitates the resistance of glioma cell to apoptosis. It was proposed that MIB2 may not only be an important hallmark to glioma disease progression, but that it may also offer novel clinical strategies to overcome resistance to cancer therapies.'\n"

Serological detection of EBV is commonly used for screening, diagnosis and epidemiological surveys of NPC. In the present study, a novel B cell multi-epitope peptide fusion protein (EBV-LMP2-3B), which is composed of three B cell linear epitopes (RIEDPPFNSLL, TLNLT and KSLSSTEFIPN) of EBV latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2), was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetate-Sepharose. The immunogenicity and binding specificity of EBV-LMP2-3B were evaluated on the basis of antibody responses in immunized BALB/c mice, western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Evaluation of EBV-LMP2-3B as a serological diagnostic reagent was performed using an indirect ELISA in 198 patients with NPC and 102 healthy adults. These results revealed that EBV-LMP2-3B was able to eliminate the high-titer serum antibody response in BALB/c mice. Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the mouse immune sera recognized the native LMP2. Compared with healthy adults, patients with NPC demonstrated significantly greater reactivity to EBV-LMP2-3B (P<0.05). Furthermore, it was possible to effectively detect specific IgG in sera from patients with NPC, with a sensitivity of 91.91% and specificity of 93.14%, representing an improvement over the traditional viral capsid antigen-IgA-based detection method with 59.59% sensitivity and 75.49% specificity. In conclusion, the EBV-LMP2-3B protein may be used as a serological diagnostic reagent to screen for and diagnose NPC.'\n",

Fresh pathological specimens collected from 317 patients with primary lung cancer through surgical resection from January 2007 to January 2012 were selected. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis were used to detect the transcription and translation of CSDAP1 in lung cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues, and the results were analyzed in combination with clinicopathological features and prognosis of lung cancer. Among 317 lung cancer specimens, 105 cases (33.1%) had high expression of CSDAP1. Among 138 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 59 cases had high expression of CSDAP1, and the high expression rate was 42.8%. Among 170 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma, 46 cases had high expression of CSDAP1, and the high expression rate was 27.5% (P<0.05). Three cases of large cell carcinoma and 9 cases of small cell carcinoma had extremely low expression or had no expression of CSDAP1. Among the 127 lung cancer patients with regional lymph node metastasis, 53 cases (41.7%) had high expression of CSDAP1, while among the 190 lung cancer patients without regional lymph node metastasis, 52 cases (27.4%) had high expression of CSDAP1 (P<0.05). The results also revealed that the expression of CSDAP1 was also related to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging of lung cancer. One-year, three-year and five-year survival rates of lung cancer patients who had no expression of CSDAP1 were relatively high (P<0.05). The results suggested that CSDAP1 may play an important role in the occurrence, development and judgement of prognosis of lung cancer.'\n",

Thirty patients with UBC were enrolled in Zhengzhou Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University from September 2013 to September 2014. Tumor tissue and adjacent healthy tissue were collected, and the levels of IL-23R and IL-17 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. Thirty healthy people were also selected to serve as normal control group. Serum levels of IL-23R and IL-17 in serum of UBC patients and normal controls were detected by ELISA, and the correlations with clinical features of UBC were analyzed. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between IL-23R and IL-17 protein expression. Follow-up study was performed by phone or during patient's visit to out-patient department. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier method to analyze the correlation between expression of IL-23R and IL-17 and survival time. ROC curve was used to detect the diagnostic values of IL-23R and IL-17 protein for UBC. Levels of IL-23R and IL-17 mRNA in UBC tissue were 3.26 and 2.65 times higher than those in adjacent tissue (P<0.05), and serum levels of IL-23R and IL-17 protein in UBC patients were significantly higher than those in normal control group. Protein expression levels of IL-23R and IL-17 were correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in UBC patients (P<0.05), and Cox hazard model showed that L-23R and IL-17 expression may be independent factors for UBC (P<0.05), and high expression levels of IL-23R and IL-17 significantly shortened the OS and DFS (P<0.05). Serum levels of IL-23R and IL-17 can be used to effectively diagnose clinical stage and lymph node metastasis of UBC patients, and the combined diagnosis has a higher sensitivity and specificity than the diagnosis using a single factor. These findings indicated that expression levels of IL-23R and IL-17 were increased in tumor tissue and serum of UBC patients, and the increased expression levels of IL-23R and IL-17 were correlated with poor prognosis. Detection of IL-23R and IL-17 levels has certain clinical significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of UBC.\"\n",

However, stable mRNA expression of Cas9 has potential risks in future gene therapy. Therefore, in the present study, a tetracycline-inducible switch was used to control the mRNA expression of Cas9. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be important functional regulators in tumor development, including in bladder cancer. RNA was designed to simultaneously target two lncRNAs, PVT1 and ANRIL, which are considered to be bladder cancer oncogenes. The mRNA expression of Cas9 was controlled by doxycycline. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of PVT1 and ANRIL was significantly inhibited by the tetracycline-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system. Functional assays demonstrated that this system could inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and suppress cell migration. Therefore, the tetracycline-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system was demonstrated to repress the malignant behavior of bladder cancer cells by controlling the expression of Cas9 and simultaneously targeting two oncogenic lncRNAs.'\n",

Fifty-eight elderly NSCLC patients comprised the observation group. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of p53 and MMP-9 in lung cancer tissues before and after chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of p53 and MMP-9 proteins in NSCLC tissue before and after chemotherapy. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end-labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect apoptotic cells. The association between the effect of chemotherapy and the expression of p53 and MMP-9 in lung cancer tissues was analysed. RT-qPCR results showed that the expression of p53 and MMP-2 mRNA in the tumor tissue after chemotherapy was significantly lower than that in the tumor tissue before chemotherapy. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of p53 and MMP-2 protein in the tumor tissue after chemotherapy was significantly decreased. The positive expression of p53 and MMP-2 in lung cancer tissues before chemotherapy was 76.25 and 71.25%, respectively, and were reduced to 27.50 and 23.75%, respectively, after chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, the positive rates of p53 and MMP-2 were significantly lower than those before chemotherapy. TUNEL results showed that the apoptosis index increased significantly after chemotherapy. Efficiency of chemotherapy in patients with a negative expression of p53 and MMP-2 in lung cancer before chemotherapy was significantly higher than that in patients with a positive p53 and MMP-2 expression. A significant difference was found in the expression levels of p53 and MMP-2 in lung cancer before and after chemotherapy.

It has previously been demonstrated that PLZF expression levels become diminished during the oncogenic transformation of certain tissue types and thus, may serve as a hallmark for tumor aggressiveness. To examine this in breast cancer, survival curves from available oncology databases were analyzed and demonstrated that PLZF expression was positively associated with increased survival in patients with breast cancer. The mRNA and protein levels of PLZF were also revealed to be associated with the tumorigenicity of four breast cancer cell lines. Since ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1 (ABCE1), also known as RNase L inhibitor, has been determined to be a target gene of PLZF, the present study also investigated whether the tumor suppressive effect of PLZF was associated with ABCE1 expression. PLZF was revealed to downregulate the expression of ABCE1 , which relieved the inhibitory effect of ABCE1 on the ribonuclease L enzyme. Finally, it was concluded that PLZF expression caused an ABCE1-mediated increase in cellular cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by a reduction in the proliferation rate of breast cancer cell lines. The results of the present study are important for understanding how PLZF exerts its final inhibitory actions in breast cancer cells, and potentially in other solid tumors, through the modulation of immunological pathways.'\n",

Furthermore, miR-6852 expression levels in patients with GC were reversely correlated with tumor metastasis and TNM stage. Through Cell Counting kit-8 and Transwell assays, it was demonstrated that overexpression of miR-6852 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. With regards to the mechanism involved, luciferase reporter assays suggested that miR-6852 directly target forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1) in GC cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-6852 markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression levels of FOXJ1 in GC cells determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Additionally, FOXJ1 was overexpressed in GC tissues and cell lines, and its expression was negatively correlated with that of miR-6852 in GC tissues. Rescue assays indicated that overexpression of FOXJ1 significantly reversed the effects of miR-6852 transfection on GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

Oxygenation index, partial pressure carbon dioxide, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels before and after CPT were compared between patients who received OPEP and patients who received mechanical percussion (MP). Sputum was collected prior to and following CPT. A total of 17 patients received OPEP, while 10 received MP. The OPEP group exhibited improved postural drainage compared with the MP group after 7 days of physiotherapy. After 7 days of CPT, patients who received OPEP also exhibited a significantly improved oxygenation index, while the oxygenation index in the MP group did not improve. The improvement of partial pressure carbon dioxide was not significantly different between groups. The OPEP group also exhibited a greater decrease in white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage and CRP levels, compared with the MP group. However, the decrease in PCT level was similar in the OPEP and MP groups. Sputum culture results revealed that the rate of negative conversion was very low in both groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of hospitalization outcomes. In conclusion, OPEP exhibited a greater effectiveness in draining sputum, improving oxygenation and reducing inflammatory status in patients with lower respiratory tract infections compared with MP; however, it did not promote the elimination of microbes.'\n",

Microarray and western blot analyses revealed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase served a role in the mPGES-1/prostaglandin E2/EP4/MAPK positive feedback loops. In addition, P38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 exhibited negative feedback effects on mPGES-1. In conclusion, the results suggested that cross-talk between mPGES-1 and the MAPK signaling pathway was very complex. Therefore, the combined regulation of mPGES-1 and the MAPK signaling pathway may be developed into a new candidate therapy for T-ALL in the future.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The present study aimed to investigate the effect of luteolin on the methylation of opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule (OPCML) in breast cancer cells, as well as its underlying mechanism of action. Human breast cancer cell lines BT474 and MCF-7 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with 0-30 µmol/l luteolin prior to investigation. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography and electrosprary ionization-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the methylation of the OPCML promoter region and whole genome. The methylation activity in the cell nucleus was determined using a DNA methyltransferase catalytic test. ELISA analysis was used to detect changes in the activity of transcription factors Sp1 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. An MTT assay was performed to determine cell proliferation, while flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle stage and apoptosis. Luteolin effectively upregulated the expression of OPCML in breast cancer cells. Luteolin activated OPCML by reducing intracellular methylation levels. Luteolin downregulated intracellular methylation levels by decreasing Sp1 and NF-κB activities. Luteolin affected the expression of DNMT1 and OPCML by downregulating Sp1 activity. Luteolin inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of BT474 and MCF-7 cells. The results of the present study suggest that luteolin inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells by decreasing the methylation and upregulating the expression of the OPCML gene.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Vascular calcification (VC) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder is a common complication of CKD. Recent studies have demonstrated that menaquinone-4 (MK-4) is negativly associated with VC in patients with CKD. Furthermore, we have previously shown that runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is important in the phenotypic transformation process of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which is the key step for the development of VC. The present study investigated the influence of MK-4 on the phenotypic transformation process of rat VSMCs in order to illustrate its role in the process of VC. Calcification assays were perfomed to access the calcified degree of rat VSMCs. Additionally, the genes and proteins related to phenotypic transformation were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting methods. It was revealed that calcium deposition in the cells was evidently increased with an addition of β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) and could be completely prevented by co-incubation with MK-4 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of Runx2 in the β-GP-induced VSMCs was inhibited by MK-4. It was also revealed that the expression of SMAD1 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 were decreased in the β-GP-induced VSMCs treated with MK-4 in a dose-dependent manner; however, the expression of SMAD7 was increased in the β-GP-induced VSMCs treated with MK-4 in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that MK-4 reduces mineralization by regulating the BMP-2 signaling pathway in order to attenuate the expression of Runx2.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. It is asymptomatic at presentation and is frequently identified among individuals with metabolic dysfunction, including obesity and diabetes. NAFLD is primarily characterized by the accumulation of triacylglycerol in the liver. Since insulin resistance and fat metabolism dysregulation are major causes of type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, anti-diabetes agents are widely considered as potential therapy strategies for NAFLD. Sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4, has been developed as an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent. In the present study, the effect of sitagliptin on the progression of NAFLD was evaluated in a rat model fed with a high fat diet (HFD). It was identified that sitagliptin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation in rat blood and liver and improved insulin resistance. Furthermore, it was revealed that sitagliptin reactivated the HFD-suppressed SIRT1/AMPK axis pathway and upregulated its downstream target genes, modulating fatty acid metabolism. These findings demonstrate a preventive effect of sitagliptin on hepatic lipid dysregulation and suggest that sitagliptin has potential as a clinical therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.'\n",

The results indicated that SND treatment recovered circulating serum cortisol, adrenocortical hormone (ACTH) and testosterone levels in a y deficiency model. Immunohistochemical analysis of pituitary and hypothalamic tissues confirmed increased expression of ACTH and corticotropin-releasing factor, respectively, in response to SND treatment. Microarray analysis identified a marked upregulation of genes involved in ≤metabolic and stress response pathways in rat adrenal tissues in response to SND treatment, exemplified by cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. , SND exerted a protective effect on mitochondria in response to HO exposure also activated NF-κB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein reporter gene activity.

A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) was established. Different doses of IWP-2, a Wnt signal inhibitor, were intrathecally injected to observe the behavior indicators at different time-points, including the pain induced by mechanical stimulation and thermal stimulation. The mRNA and protein levels of Wnt-3a, Frizzled 4 and β-catenin in lumbar (L) 4-6 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of rats in each group, as well as synaptic plasticity-related molecules in DRG region of rats were detected by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Compared with Sham group and Naive group, paw withdrawal thermal latency and paw withdrawal mechanical threshold were significantly decreased after CCI, while synaptic plasticity was increased (P<0.05). Besides, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was observed in rats with CCI. We found that intrathecal injection of IWP-2 effectively relieved the pain behavior and reduced the synaptic plasticity in rats with neuropathic pain after CCI, suggesting that the inactivated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway might be the major mechanism responsible for this effect. Our data demonstrated that intrathecal injection of IWP-2 ameliorated neuropathic pain in CCI rats by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.'\n",

Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was used to detect the polymorphisms of locus rs1799987A/G in CCR5 gene and locus rs35829419A/C in NLRP3 gene of 171 pairs of HCV patients. SPSS 20.0 software was used for logistic regression analysis, and genetics package of the R programming language for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. The frequencies of locus rs1799987A/G in CCR5 gene in the case group were 48.0 and 52.0%, while those in the control group were 47.9 and 52.1%; the frequencies of locus rs35829419A/C in NLRP3 gene were 55.8 and 44.2%, while those in the control group were 55.3 and 44.7%. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that the distribution of CCR5 gene polymorphism in the case group was statistically different from that in the control group (P<0.05), which had a statistical correlation with the renal damage due to HCV-related cryoglobulinemia (P<0.05).

Autophagy serves a role in these injuries. The present study established a mouse model of arecoline-induced hepatic injury and investigated the role of autophagy-associated proteins in this injury. The results indicated that the expression levels of the autophagy marker protein microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 B (MAP1LC3B) and autophagy-promoting protein beclin 1 were elevated in the injured hepatic cells, while the expression levels of a well-known negative regulator of autophagy, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), were reduced. Following treatment of the hepatic injury with glutathione, the liver function improved and liver damage was reduced effectively. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of both MAP1LC3B and beclin 1 were significantly upregulated in the glutathione-treated mice, but the expression of mTOR was significantly downregulated. It may be concluded that in the process of protecting against arecoline-induced hepatic injury, glutathione cooperates with mTOR and beclin 1 to accelerate autophagy, maintaining stable cell morphology and cellular functions.'\n"

A total of 109 patients, who underwent primary surgery with the goal of maximal tumor resection followed by standard combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, were analyzed in the present study. The expression level of TRIM44 was determined by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in 109 ECO tissues. It was found that the expression of TRIM44 was low in normal tissues and high in EOC tissues. Univariate survival analysis showed that the overexpression of TRIM44 was significantly associated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that there was a significant difference in overall survival and disease-free survival rates between patients with a high expression of TRIM44 and patients with a low expression of TRIM44. Patients with a high expression level of TRIM44 exhibited poorer overall survival and disease-free survival rates, compared with patients expressing a low level of TRIM44 (P<0.001).

Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), isolated from , has been reported to inhibit I/R-induced cell death in the brain. The present study aimed to investigate the protective ability of GRb1 on focal cerebral I/R rats and to explore its further mechanisms. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was established and treated with different doses of Rb1. The neurological deficits were examined after reperfusion, and TTC staining was applied to assess the infarct volume. Histology and TUNEL staining were performed to evaluate pathological changes and neuronal cell apoptosis in brain tissues. HMGB1 and levels of inflammatory factors and proteins, were examined by ELISA or western blotting. Rb1 treatment notably improved the neurological deficits in an MCAO model, accompanied by decreased infarct volume in the brain tissues. Histological examination revealed that the necrotic tissue area in MCAO rats was also diminished by Rb1 treatment. Apoptosis induced by cerebral I/R was also attenuated by Rb1 treatment via downregulation of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 levels. HMGB1 release was inhibited by Rb1 treatment in MCAO rats, and the levels of nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide were also decreased. The present study suggests that Rb1 serves a protective role in I/R-induced cerebral-neuron injury, due to the decreased cerebral infarct volume of brain tissue. The mechanisms underlying these effects may be associated with the inhibition of HMGB1 inflammatory signals.'\n",

However, the role of RKIP in acute liver injury has remained elusive. In the present study, acute liver failure was induced by thioacetamide in mice, and locostatin was used to interfere with RKIP expression. It was found that RKIP expression was significantly inhibited by locostatin. Down-regulation of RKIP expression resulted in severe liver injury and extensive release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, reduced RKIP expression significantly enhanced the levels of reactive oxygen species and the content of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α as well as interleukin-6 and -1β, and decreased the levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 and heme oxygenase-1. Furthermore, down-regulation of RKIP promoted the activation of the nuclear factor-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways. In conclusion, the present study indicates an inverse correlation between RKIP level and the degree of hepatic injury, that is, a decrease in RKIP expression may exacerbate acute liver failure.'\n",

A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into a control group (n=6) and an experimental group (n=24). To induce CM in the rats of the experimental group, 2 mg/kg Adriamycin (ADR) was administered intraperitoneally with 5 equal injections every third day followed by 5 weekly injections resulting in a cumulative dose of 20 mg/kg. Following establishment of the model, rats in the experimental group were subdivided into a PTH-untreated CM group that received daily normal saline subcutaneous injections for 7 days and three treated CM groups that received daily subcutaneous injections of 5, 10, or 20 µg/kg of recombinant PTH for 7 days. Rats in the control group accordingly received intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections of normal saline. Blood sample analysis revealed that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin T, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine and phosphorus concentrations were increased in the PTH-untreated CM group compared with that in the control group, whereas PTH and calcium concentrations were decreased. Administration of PTH dose-dependently decreased BNP, CRP, creatinine and phosphorus levels, and increased PTH and calcium levels. Notably, there were significant differences in PTH, BNP, troponin T, CRP, creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus levels among the rats in the five groups (P<0.01). Cardiac ultrasonography results indicated that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly decreased in rats treated with ADR compared with the rats from the control group (P<0.01). However, the LVEF gradually recovered with elevated PTH treatment doses. The overall differences of LVEF and left ventricular end-systolic volume in the five experimental groups were statistically significant (P<0.01).

The QconCAT protein is labeled with a heavy isotope upon expression in  and known amounts of the purified protein are spiked into a whole cell protein extract. Upon tryptic digestion, labeled and unlabeled peptides are released from the QconCAT protein and the native proteins, respectively, and both are quantified by LC-MS/MS. The labeled Q-peptides then serve as standards for determining the absolute quantity of the native peptides/proteins. Here, we have applied the QconCAT approach to  for the absolute quantification of the major proteins and protein complexes driving photosynthetic light reactions in the thylakoid membranes and carbon fixation in the pyrenoid. We found that with 25.2 attomol/cell the Rubisco large subunit makes up 6.6% of all proteins in a  cell and with this exceeds the amount of the small subunit by a factor of 1.56. EPYC1, which links Rubisco to form the pyrenoid, is eight times less abundant than RBCS, and Rubisco activase is 32-times less abundant than RBCS. With 5.2 attomol/cell, photosystem II is the most abundant complex involved in the photosynthetic light reactions, followed by plastocyanin, photosystem I and the cytochrome b/ complex, which range between 2.9 and 3.5 attomol/cell. The least abundant complex is the ATP synthase with 2 attomol/cell. While applying the QconCAT approach, we have been able to identify many potential pitfalls associated with this technique. We analyze and discuss these pitfalls in detail and provide an optimized workflow for future applications of this technique.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Photosynthetic assimilation is remarkably altered by heat and drought, and this depends on the individual or combined occurrence of stressors and their respective intensities and durations. Abiotic stressors may also alter the nutritional quality and economic value of crops. In this controlled greenhouse study, we evaluated the response of  L., from flowering to seed development, to two temperature and water treatments and a combination of these treatments. The diffusional limitations of stomatal conductance and mesophyll conductance on photosynthesis, as well as resource-use efficiency (particularly water and nitrogen), were assessed. In addition, the effects of stressors on the seed fatty acid content and composition and the total protein content were examined. The results showed that the reduction in the net photosynthetic assimilation rate was caused by combinations of heat and drought (heat + drought) treatments, by drought alone, and, to a lesser extent, by heat alone. The stomatal conductance decreased under drought and heat + drought treatments but not under heat. Conversely, the mesophyll conductance was reduced significantly in the plants exposed to heat and heat + drought but not in the plants exposed to drought alone. The carboxylation efficiency rate and the electron transport rate were reduced under the heat treatment. The seed yield was reduced by 85.3% under the heat treatment and, to a lesser extent, under the drought treatment (31%). This emphasizes the devastating effects of hotter weather on seed formation and development. Seed oil content decreased by 52% in the plants exposed to heat, the protein content increased under all the stress treatments. Heat treatment had a more deleterious effect than drought on the seed oil composition, leading to enhanced levels of saturated fatty oils and, consequently, desaturation efficiency, a measure of oil frying ability. Overall, this study showed that except for the photosynthetic assimilation rate and stomatal conductance, heat, rather than drought, negatively affected the photosynthetic capacity, yield, and oil quality attributes when imposed during the flowering and silique-filling stages. This result highlights the necessity for a better understanding of heat tolerance mechanisms in crops to help to create germplasms that are adapted to rapid climate warming.'\n",

Their roles in cellular signaling are mediated mostly by direct interactions with various receptors via the TRAF domain. To determine how specific TRAF domains can interact with various receptors with a limited binding interface and how similar binding interfaces of TRAF family members can recognize their specific binding partners, extensive structural studies on TRAF family proteins have been conducted for several decades. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the structural and molecular diversity of the TRAF domain and TRAF-binding motifs in many receptors according to available structural information.'\n",

We have recently demonstrated that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells transduced with a PD1-CD28 fusion protein are protected from PD-1-mediated inhibition. We have now investigated the potential of PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells alone or in combination with CD8+ T cells for immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  OVA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ were retrovirally transduced with the PD1-CD28 fusion protein. Cytokine release, proliferation, cytotoxic activity, and phenotype of transduced T cells were assessed in the context of Panc02-OVA (murine pancreatic cancer model) and E.G7-PD-L1 (murine T cell lymphoma model) cells.  Stimulation of PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and recombinant PD-L1 induced specific T cell activation, as measured by IFN-y release and T cell proliferation. Coculture with Panc02-OVA or E.G7-PD-L1 tumor cells also led to specific activation of CD4+ T cells. Cytokine release and T cell proliferation was most effective when tumor cells simultaneously encountered genetically engineered CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Synergy between both cell populations was also observed for specific tumor cell lysis. T cell cytotoxicity was mediated via granzyme B release and mediated enhanced tumor control . Transduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in co-culture with tumor cells developed a predominant central memory phenotype over time. Different ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ transduced T cells led to a significant increase of IFN-y and IL-2 secretion positively correlating with CD4+ T cell numbers used. Mechanistically, IL-2 and MHC-I were central to the synergistic activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, since neutralization of IL-2 prevented the crosstalk between these cell populations.  PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells significantly improved anti-tumoral effect of fusion protein-transduced CD8+ T cells. Thus, our results indicate that PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells have the potential to overcome the PD-1-PD-L1 immunosuppressive axis in pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.'\n",

IL-17A is a critical cytokine that is essential for clearance of . However, the mechanism by which ATF3 induces IL-17A production remains unknown. Here, we show that ATF3 induces IL-17A production via NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion. Survival rates were comparable in IL-17A-depleted and ATF3 KO mice but were lower than in WT mice treated with isotype control, indicating that ATF3 positively regulated IL-17A production. Indeed, ATF3 KO mice showed a marked reduction in IL-17A protein and mRNA expression compared to levels in WT mice. Moreover, mitochondrial IL-1β production by bone marrow-derived macrophages was significantly reduced in ATF3 KO mice as a result of the disruption of cellular ROS and Ca homeostasis. Accordingly, ATF3 KO mice displayed diminished survival and bacterial clearance following  infection. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism in which macrophage ATF3 promotes IL-17A production in γδ T cells to rapidly induce host defenses during early  infection.'\n",

The paracaspase MALT1 is the only CBM component having an enzymatic (proteolytic) activity and has therefore recently gained attention as a potential drug target. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of the molecular function of the protease MALT1 and summarize how MALT1 scaffold and protease function contribute to the transmission of CBM signals.

For example, these molecules may impair the insulin signaling pathway or provide protection against IR. Thus, identifying proteins that are upregulated in IR states is relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the associated disorders. It is becoming clear that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an important component of the pathophysiology of IR, with increased levels in most common IR conditions, including obesity. HGF has a role in the metabolic flux of glucose in different insulin sensitive cell types; plays a key role in β-cell homeostasis; and is capable of modulating the inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss how, and to what extent HGF contributes to IR and diabetes pathophysiology, as well as its role in cancer which is more prevalent in obesity and diabetes. Based on the current literature and knowledge, it is clear that HGF plays a central role in these metabolic disorders. Thus, HGF levels could be employed as a biomarker for disease status/progression, and HGF/c-Met signaling pathway modulators could effectively regulate IR and treat diabetes.'\n",

Biomarkers that characterize cases by severity and pathogenic mechanisms involved are not yet available but needed for the implementation of rational therapies. Here, we used shotgun proteomics to obtain information from plasma samples about local and systemic pathologies taking place during cases of alcoholic AP. Plasma was obtained at Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital (Lithuania) from 12 AP patients of alcohol related etiology (median age of 40) within 24 h of presentation, and 12 age-matched, healthy controls. Patients entered into the study had moderately severe AP with the following characteristics: mean blood lactate dehydrogenase level of 1127 mg/dl; median APACHEII score of 5.5 and mean IMRIE score of 3.5. For proteomic analysis, less-abundant proteins in plasma samples were enriched using Top 12 abundant protein depletion columns. Further processing was performed by a modified filter-assisted sample preparation combined with tandem mass tag labeling for quantitation. Samples were analyzed using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer for high resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our analysis revealed 31 proteins that exhibited significant 1.5-fold or higher increases in the AP compared to control patients, and six that were significantly decreased. Gene ontology analysis indicated a strong correlation with exosomal origin in the elevated proteins, with 29/31 (93.5%) associated with this extracellularly-secreted compartment. Elevated proteins included established and proposed biomarkers of AP including C-reactive protein, LPS-binding protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and von Willebrand factor, as well as several novel potential biomarkers.

      "Abstract :\"β-thalassemia major (β-TM) is a therapeutically challenging chronic disease in which ineffective erythropoiesis is a main pathophysiological factor. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles released by cells into biological fluids; they are involved in intercellular communication and in multiple physiological and pathological processes. The chaperone heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), which is released from cells via EVs, aggravates ineffective erythropoiesis in β-TM. We propose that β-TM EVs may show specific signatures, reflecting disease mechanisms, stages and severity. Our study aims were to define EV profiles in β-TM patients, investigate the influence of hypersplenism and splenectomy on EV features, and explore the association of circulating EVs with ineffective erythropoiesis and iron-overload parameters. We characterized circulating EVs in 35 transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients and 35 controls using several techniques. Nanoparticle-tracking analysis revealed increased EV concentration in patients vs. controls ( = 0.0036), with smaller EV counts and sizes in patients with hypersplenism. Flow cytometry analysis showed lower levels of RBC and monocyte EVs in patients vs. controls. RBC-EV levels correlated with patient hematocrit, reflecting degree of anemia. The procoagulant potential of the EVs evaluated by flow cytometry revealed lower levels of endothelial protein C receptor-labeled EVs in patients vs. controls, and increased tissue factor-to-tissue factor pathway inhibitor-labeled EV ratio in splenectomized patients, suggesting a hypercoagulable state. Protein content, evaluated in EV pellets, showed increased levels of HSP70 in patients ( = 0.0018), inversely correlated with transfusion requirement and hemoglobin levels, and positively correlated with reticulocyte, erythropoietin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. This first description of EVs in patients with hypersplenism reveals the spleen's importance in EV physiology and clearance. Circulating EV-HSP70 levels were associated with markers of ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis and hematological disease severity. EV analysis in β-TM-reflecting spleen status, hypercoagulability state and ineffective erythropoiesis-may serve as a biomarker of disease dynamics, supporting both anticipation of the risk of complications and optimizing treatment.\"\n",

RB was separated from the n-butanol fraction of the crude methanolic extract by chromatographic separation on a Si gel column according to the procedures described previously. The experiment of the biological assessment of RB used 32 male Wistar rats (4 groups,  = 8). Group 1 rats were fed with a palatable normal diet. Group 2, 3, and 4 were fed on HF diet for 16 weeks. Group 2 served as the HF diet control group while Group 3 and 4 received daily oral doses of RB (25 and 50 mg/kg) during the last four weeks. Animals' parameters like weight gain, fasting level of blood sugar, serum lipids, and serum liver enzyme activities were measured. Liver or adipose tissue weight was divided by the rat's body weight and multiplied by 100 to obtain the liver or adipose tissue index, respectively. Adipose tissues were processed for histopathological examination, measurement of mRNA expression of visfatin, leptin, adiponectin, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1). Furthermore, serum levels of insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), leptin, resistin, and adiponectin were assessed using ELISA kits.  Rats fed with the HF diet exhibited significant body weight gain, abnormal liver function, disturbed lipid profile, and greater serum level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in addition to greater insulin resistance, adipose tissue and liver indices. Further, rats fed with the HF diet displayed upregulations in the expression of visfatin and leptin with downregulations in the expression of adiponectin, UCP-1, and CPT-1 compared to normal rats. Interestingly, RB (25 or 50 mg/kg) favorably modulated the measured parameters.  Data from this study documented the beneficial role of RB in diminishing weight gain, improving the inflammatory perturbations and energy expenditure in HF diet fed rats. Therefore, RB might be a promising candidate for obesity.\"\n"

Magnoflorine, a quaternary alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb Magnolia or Aristolochia, has been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of magnoflorine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice has not been reported. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of magnoflorine on LPS-induced ALI and elucidate its possible molecular mechanisms in RAW264.7 cells. The results of histopathological changes as well as the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity indicated that magnoflorine significantly alleviated the lung injury induced by LPS. In addition, qPCR results showed that magnoflorine dose-dependently decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Immunofluorescence assay also confirmed that the level of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induced by LPS was inhibited by magnoflorine treatment. Further experiments were performed using Western blotting to detect the expression of related proteins in the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results showed that magnoflorine suppressed the levels of phosphorylated p65, IκBα, p38, ERK, and JNK. In conclusion, all data indicate that magnoflorine could protect against LPS-induced inflammation in ALI at least partially by inhibiting TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.'\n",

However, understanding of the molecular determinants of AR-DR heteromerization and the allosteric antagonistic interactions between the receptor protomers is still limited. In this work, a structural model of the AR-DR heterodimer was generated using a combined experimental and computational approach. Regions involved in the heteromer interface were modeled based on the effects of peptides derived from the transmembrane (TM) helices on AR-DR receptor-receptor interactions in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and proximity ligation assays. Peptides corresponding to TM-IV and TM-V of the AR blocked heterodimer interactions and disrupted the allosteric effect of AR activation on DR agonist binding. Protein-protein docking was used to construct a model of the AR-DR heterodimer with a TM-IV/V interface, which was refined using molecular dynamics simulations. Mutations in the predicted interface reduced AR-DR interactions in BRET experiments and altered the allosteric modulation. The heterodimer model provided insights into the structural basis of allosteric modulation and the technique developed to characterize the AR-DR interface can be extended to study the many other G protein-coupled receptors that engage in heteroreceptor complexes.'\n",

Although insects show a diverse array of molecular receptors dedicated to the detection of sensory cues, two main types of molecular receptors have been described as responsible for olfactory reception in , the odorant receptors (ORs) and the ionotropic receptors (IRs). Although both receptor families share the role of being the first chemosensors in the insect olfactory system, they show distinct evolutionary origins and several distinct structural and functional characteristics. While ORs are seven-transmembrane-domain receptor proteins, IRs are related to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family. Both types of receptors are expressed on the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the main olfactory organ, the antenna, but they are housed in different types of sensilla, IRs in coeloconic sensilla and ORs in basiconic and trichoid sensilla. More importantly, from the functional point of view, they display different odorant specificity profiles. Research advances in the last decade have improved our understanding of the molecular basis, evolution and functional roles of these two families, but there are still controversies and unsolved key questions that remain to be answered. Here, we present an updated review on the advances of the genetic basis, evolution, structure, functional response and regulation of both types of chemosensory receptors. We use a comparative approach to highlight the similarities and differences among them. Moreover, we will discuss major open questions in the field of olfactory reception in insects. A comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional convergence and divergence of both types of receptors will help in elucidating the molecular basis of the function and regulation of chemoreception in insects.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Dopamine is a brain neurotransmitter involved in the pathology of schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis states that, in schizophrenia, dopaminergic signal transduction is hyperactive. The cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is an intracellular protein that regulates the expression of genes that are important in dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine affects the phosphorylation of CREB via G protein-coupled receptors. Neurotrophins, such as brain derived growth factor (BDNF), are critical regulators during neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. The CREB is one of the major regulators of neurotrophin responses since phosphorylated CREB binds to a specific sequence in the promoter of BDNF and regulates its transcription. Moreover, susceptibility genes associated with schizophrenia also target and stimulate the activity of CREB. Abnormalities of CREB expression is observed in the brain of individuals suffering from schizophrenia, and two variants (-933T to C and -413G to A) were found only in schizophrenic patients. The CREB was also involved in the therapy of animal models of schizophrenia. Collectively, these findings suggest a link between CREB and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This review provides an overview of CREB structure, expression, and biological functions in the brain and its interaction with dopamine signaling, neurotrophins, and susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. Animal models in which CREB function is modulated, by either overexpression of the protein or knocked down through gene deletion/mutation, implicating CREB in schizophrenia and antipsychotic drugs efficacy are also discussed. Targeting research and drug development on CREB could potentially accelerate the development of novel medications against schizophrenia.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Parkinson\\'s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused mainly by lack of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory, and other functions; its level is decreased in PD brain as a result of dopaminergic cell death. Dopamine loss in PD brain is a cause of motor deficiency and, possibly, a reason of the cognitive deficit observed in some PD patients. PD is mostly not recognized in its early stage because of a long latency between the first damage to dopaminergic cells and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is very important to find reliable molecular biomarkers that can distinguish PD from other conditions, monitor its progression, or give an indication of a positive response to a therapeutic intervention. PD biomarkers can be subdivided into four main types: clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic. For a long time protein biomarkers, dopamine metabolites, amino acids, etc. in blood, serum, cerebrospinal liquid (CSF) were considered the most promising. Among the candidate biomarkers that have been tested, various forms of α-synuclein (α-syn), i.e., soluble, aggregated, post-translationally modified, etc. were considered potentially the most efficient. However, the encouraging recent results suggest that microRNA-based analysis may bring considerable progress, especially if it is combined with α-syn data. Another promising analysis is the advanced metabolite profiling of body fluids, called \"metabolomics\" which may uncover metabolic fingerprints specific for various stages of PD. Conventional pharmacological treatment of PD is based on the replacement of dopamine using dopamine precursors (levodopa, L-DOPA, L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine), dopamine agonists (amantadine, apomorphine) and MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), which can be used alone or in combination with each other. Potential risk factors include environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular damage, and genomic defects. This review covers molecules that might act as the biomarkers of PD. Then, PD risk factors (including genetics and non-genetic factors) and PD treatment options are discussed.'\n"

This reduction did not result from decreased transcription of IL-6 and TNFα genes, and therefore appeared to result from post-transcriptional inhibition of synthesis of these cytokines. MSO treatment did not inhibit total protein synthesis and did not reduce the production of a third LPS-triggered cytokine CXCL1, so the effect was not a toxic or global downregulation of the LPS response. The anti-inflammatory effects of a glutamine synthetase inhibitor were seen even though the medium contained abundant (2\\xa0mM) glutamine, suggesting that the target for this activity was not glutamine synthetase. In agreement with this hypothesis, the L, isomer of MSO, which does not inhibit glutamine synthetase and was previously thought to be inert, both significantly reduced IL-6 secretion in isolated macrophages and increased survival in a mouse model for inflammatory liver failure.\\n\\nConclusions: Our findings provide evidence for a novel target of MSO.

A Congo red-positive region was detected in the anterior half of the stroma in the center and inferior cornea. Although hemotoxylin and eosin staining revealed irregularity in the Congo red-positive region, other parts of the stroma did not show any abnormalities. Positive staining both by anti-TGFBIp and anti-lactoferrin antibodies was observed in the Congo red-positive region. Interestingly, all the layers of the corneal stroma, including the peripheral region, were positively stained by anti-TFGBIp antibody, even in the Congo red-negative area. Masson's trichrome staining also showed irregular staining throughout the corneal stroma, even outside of the Congo red-positive region. Additionally, Bowman's layer, which consists of collagen type IV, was damaged. TGFBIp was strongly expressed and Masson's trichrome staining was reduced throughout the entire keratoconic stroma. The constant qualitative changes in keratoconic collagen fibers, along with the observed abnormality in the Bowman's membrane, might point to the pathogenesis of secondary corneal amyloidosis in keratoconus.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"Purpose: Zinc finger protein 259 (ZNF259), also known as ZPR1, is a zinc finger-containing protein that can bind the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR. At present, our knowledge on ZNF259 in cancers is limited. Here, we aimed to explore the biological functions of ZNF259 in breast cancer and reveal their mechanisms.\\n\\nPatients and methods: The expression of ZNF259 was measured in 133 cases of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. The online database Kaplan-Meier (KM) Plotter Online Tool was used to analyze the relationship between ZNF259 expression and breast cancer patient survival prognosis. Plasmid transfection and small interfering RNA and inhibitor treatments were carried out to explore the functions of ZNF259 in breast cancer cell lines and its potential mechanism. Matrigel invasion and wound healing assays were performed to detect the invasion and migration ability of cancer cells. In addition, protein expressions in tissues and cells were determined by Western blotting.\\n\\nResults: ZNF259 expression was much higher in breast cancer cells than in the adjacent normal breast duct glandular epithelial cells (75.94% vs 7.52%, <0.001) and was closely related to the breast cancer patients' TNM stages (=0.013) and lymph node metastasis (=0.021). Knockdown of ZNF259 could downregulate p-ERK, p-GSK3β, and Snail expression, and upregulate the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1, and then it also inhibited invasion and migration by the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Correspondingly, ZNF259 transfection could upregulate p-ERK, p-GSK3β, and Snail expression, and downregulate E-cadherin and ZO-1 expression, which led to stronger invasion and migration abilities of cancer cells. Furthermore, the ERK inhibitor U0126 could reverse all these effects induced by ZNF259 transfection.\\n\\nConclusion: ZNF259 could promote breast cancer cell invasion and migration by activating the ERK/GSK3β/Snail signaling pathway.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Purpose: Molecular biomarkers, especially serologic factors, have been widely applied in cancer diagnosis and patient follow-up. However, there are few valuable prognostic factors in penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). Here, the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC.\\n\\nPatients and methods: This study included 114 PSCC patients. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect LAMC2 expression; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to test sLAMC2 concentration; and a Transwell assay and an in vivo experiment in nude mice were used to test PSCC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the association between LAMC2 level and clinical parameters, the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio for death, and Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis.\\n\\nResults: LAMC2 was overexpressed in PSCC tissues, and the LAMC2 expression level was higher in metastatic lymph node (LN) tissues than in primary cancer tissues; moreover, the LAMC2 levels in primary cancer tissues and sLAMC2 were higher in patients with LN metastasis than in those without LN metastasis. Upregulated LAMC2 facilitated the migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of PSCC cells in vitro and promoted LN metastasis of PSCC cells in nude mice. Elevated LAMC2 levels were strongly correlated with advanced clinicopathologic parameters, especially LN metastasis, in PSCC patients and predicted shorter disease-specific survival. The predictive value of sLAMC2 is superior to that of C-reactive protein and squamous cell carcinoma antigen previously reported in PSCC patients, and a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer (especially at the N stage) than in later-stage penile cancer.\\n\\nConclusion: These findings suggest that sLAMC2 is a potential serologic prognostic marker in PSCC and could aid in risk stratification in early-stage PSCC patients.'\n"

Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, exhibits effective antitumor effects in various cancers. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of TSA on multiple myeloma (MM) are not fully investigated.\\n\\nMethods: In the present study, RPMI8226 and MM.1S cells treated with TSA were used for cell proliferation, cell cycle, and survival examinations, then the localization and post transcriptional modification of GLI1 protein as well as the target gene P21 were analyzed using immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, western blots and qPCR, respectively.\\n\\nResults: TSA exerted a time and dose-dependent cytotoxicity on MM cell lines, and suppressed the proliferation of MM cells and induced an upregulation of p21 protein accompanied by a decreased expression of cyclin D1. TSA treatment led to a downregulation of GLI1, and the nuclear accumulation of GLI1 was also inhibited. As a result of hedgehog inhibition, the expression of  and  was greatly weakened after TSA treatment. Furthermore, TSA accelerated GLI1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Additionally, p21 induction also contributed to GLI1 downregulation via reducing the transcription of GLI in mRNA level. Rescue experiments verified that exogenous expression of GLI1 alleviated MM cell apoptosis induced by TSA.\\n\\nConclusion: These results indicated that TSA represses MM cell growth and induces cell apoptosis. The inhibition of hedgehog signaling is an important mechanism accounting for the cytotoxic effects of TSA.'\n",

      "Abstract :'CCN proteins are secreted into the extracellular environment where they interact with both components of the extracellular matrix and with cell surface receptors to regulate cellular function. Through these interactions, CCNs act as extracellular ligands to activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. CCN4/WISP-1, like other CCNs, plays multiple physiologic roles in development and also participates in pathogenesis. CCN4 is of particular interest with respect to cancer, showing promise as a biomarker or prognostic factor as well as a potential therapeutic target. This review focuses on recent work addressing the role of CCN4 in cancer. While CCN4 has been identified as an oncogene in a number of cancers, where it enhances cell migration and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, there are other cancers where CCN4 appears to play an inhibitory role. The mechanisms underlying these differences in cellular response have not yet been delineated, but are an active area of investigation. The expression and activities of CCN4 splice variants are likewise an emerging area for study. CCN4 acts as an autocrine factor that regulates the cancer cells from which it is secreted. However, CCN4 is also a paracrine factor that is secreted by stromal fibroblasts, and can affect the function of vascular endothelial cells. In summary, current evidence is abundant in regard to establishing potential roles for CCN4 in oncogenesis, but much remains to be learned about the functions of this fascinating protein as both an autocrine and paracrine regulator in the tumor microenvironment.'\n",

Moreover, EIF3G silencing decreased the activity of the drug-related proteins MDR1 and MRP levels in HCT116/5-Fu cells. Finally, the xenograft tumor model further confirmed that EIF3G resensitized HCT116/5-Fu tumors to 5-Fu. We observed that EIF3G silencing followed by 5-Fu administration had a synergistic interaction effect on HCT116/5-Fu in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nConclusion: These findings demonstrate that EIF3G is a targetable regulator of chemoresistance in CRC, and inhibiting EIF3G in combination with 5-Fu might be a potential therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.'\n"

Knockdown of SOX2OT inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in NSCLC cells. Moreover, we explored the regulatory mechanism of SOX2OT and found that SOX2OT directly bound microRNA 132 (miR-132) in NSCLC cells. Importantly, miR-132 inhibition partially reversed the SOX2OT knockdown-mediated inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process. We also found that SOX2OT could regulate zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (a target of miR-132) expression, which played crucial roles in tumor cell proliferation and invasion.\\n\\nConclusion: These findings indicated that SOX2OT was a noncoding oncogene that exerted important regulatory functions in NSCLC via sponging miR-132 and might represent a novel strategy for overcoming this disease.'\n",

The state of subjects in the CI group was validated by computed tomography or MRI. The clinical data were categorized into two groups. The data included age, gender, smoking, drinking, shrinkage pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, serum uric acid, fibrinogen and homocysteine. The polymorphisms were genotyped with PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The distribution characteristics of nonstoke subjects and CI patients and the relationship between the polymorphisms of the  gene of platelet membrane receptor P2Y12 and ischemic stroke were analyzed.\\n\\nResults: No significant difference was found between the contrast group and CI group (>0.05) in terms of age, gender composition, smoking, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid and homocysteine. In contrast, significant differences were found between these two groups (<0.01) in terms of SBP, DBP and plasma fibrinogen level. The genotyping revealed 112 carriers of the wild-type H1/H1 genotype and 40 carriers of the mutational H2 allele of P2Y12 H1/H2 in the CI group and 140 carriers of the wild-type H1/H1 genotype and 28 carriers of the mutational H2 allele of P2Y12 H1/H2 in the contrast group.

It can activate and expand cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, leading to potent antitumor effects. Various forms of IL-15 are now in different stages of development for cancer immunotherapy. One of the major issues with IL-15 or IL15-IL15Rα fusion is high toxicity due to systemic activation of immune cells.\\n\\nMaterials and methods: In this study, we engineered a nanobody-cytokine fusion molecule, anti-CEA-IL15, in which an anti-CEA nanobody was linked to an IL15Rα-IL15 fusion. The nanobody-cytokine fusion exhibited multiple mechanisms to kill tumor cells, including promoting immune cell proliferation and directing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against CEA-positive tumor cells.\\n\\nResults: In xenograft models, anti-CEA-IL15 was localized in the tumor microenvironment and exhibited more potent antitumor activities than non-targeting IL-15, supporting potential application of this multifunctional fusion molecule in tumor immunotherapy.\\n\\nConclusion: We generated and validated a tumortargeting fusion protein, anti-CEA-IL15, which has potent cytokine activity to activate and mobilize the immune system to fight cancer cells. Such strategies may also be applied to other cytokines and tumor-targeting molecules to increase antitumor efficacy.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Background: Differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes could be improved by inhibiting signaling pathways such as Wnt and Notch. 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]D) can ameliorate oligodendrogenesis. We investigated whether they could increase oligodendrogenesis by inhibiting the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways.\\n\\nMethods: Cortical neural stem cells were isolated from 14-day-old rat embryos and cultured using the neurosphere assay. The cells were treated in 4 different conditions for 1 week: the negative control group received only the basic fibroblast growth factor, the positive control group received only T without growth factors, the RA group was treated with 9-cis-RA, and the Vit D group was treated with 1,25(OH)D. The effects of 9-cis-RA and 1,25(OH)D on the level of the myelin basic protein (MBP) and the gene expression of the SOX10, MBP gene, HES5, and LRP6 were studied using flow cytometry and real-time PCR. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with GraphPad Prism. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.\\n\\nResults: The mRNA expressions of the SOX10, MBP, and MBP gene were significantly increased in the treated groups compared with the negative control group; the increase was similar in the 9-cis-RA group and the positive control group. Furthermore, 9-cis-RA significantly decreased the expression of the HES5 gene, a Notch signaling pathway transcription factor, and 1,25(OH)D significantly reduced the expression of the LRP6 gene, a Wnt signaling pathway co-receptor.\\n\\nConclusion: It seems that 9-cis-RA and 1,25(OH)D are good candidates to improve the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes.'\n",

It is well recognized that appropriate medicine reduces the burden on not only young patients but elderly ones as well. We enrolled 56 patients aged 75 and over who were diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia (body temperature: ≧37.5 °C; white blood cell (WBC) count: ≧10,000/μL; C-reactive protein (CRP): ≧4 mg/dL) on the basis of Clinical Evaluation Methods for New Antimicrobial Agents to Treat Respiratory Infections defined by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, at the National Hospital Organization Kanazawa Medical Center from January 1, 2007 to May 31, 2010. Forty-two patients were given MEPM twice a day and 14 were given the same drug three times a day in a Japanese community hospital. After four days, the three times a day group showed significant decreases in body temperature, WBC count, and CRP level, which are commonly used indices for evaluating therapeutic effects. Similarly, the twice a day group showed decreases of those indices, and both treatments had no serious adverse effects. Simulation analysis based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory revealed that both treatments effectively inhibited the activities of , , , and , which are the major bacteria in the patients. In this retrospective study, simulation analysis based on the PK/PD theory revealed that even the twice a day MEPM administration has sufficient effectiveness against pneumonia.

      "Abstract :'The Notch signaling pathway is highly conserved and essential for animal development. It is required for cell differentiation, survival, and proliferation. Regulation of Notch signaling is a crucial process for human health. Ligands initiate a signal cascade by binding to Notch receptors expressed on a neighboring cell. Notch receptors interact with ligands through their epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGF repeats). Most EGF repeats are modified by -glycosylation with residues such as -linked -acetylglucosamine (-GlcNAc), -fucose, and -glucose. These -glycan modifications are important for Notch function. Defects in -glycosylation affect Notch-ligand interaction, trafficking of Notch receptors, and Notch stability on the cell surface. Although the roles of each modification are not fully understood, -fucose is essential for binding of Notch receptors to their ligands. We reported an EGF domain-specific -GlcNAc transferase (EOGT) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in genes encoding EOGT or NOTCH1 cause Adams-Oliver syndrome. Dysregulation of Notch signaling because of defects or mutations in Notch receptors or Notch signal-regulating proteins, such as glycosyltransferases, induce a variety of congenital disorders. In this review, we discuss -glycosylation of Notch receptors and congenital human diseases caused by defects in -glycans on Notch receptors.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Vitamin K plays a crucial role in the regulation of vascular calcifications by allowing activation of matrix Gla protein. The dietary requirement for vitamin K is low because of an efficient recycling of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1). However, decreased VKORC1 activity may result in vascular calcification. More than 30 coding mutations of VKORC1 have been described. While these mutations have been suspected of causing anticoagulant resistance, their association with an increase in the risk of vascular calcification has never been considered. We thus investigated functional cardiovascular characteristics in a rat model mutated in VKORC1. This study revealed that limited intake in vitamin K in mutated rat induced massive calcified areas in the media of arteries of lung, aortic arch, kidneys and testis. Development of calcifications could be inhibited by vitamin K supplementation. In calcified areas, inactive Matrix Gla protein expression increased, while corresponding mRNA expression was not modified. Mutation in VKORC1 associated with a limited vitamin K intake is thus a major risk for cardiovascular disease. Our model is the first non-invasive rat model that shows spontaneous medial calcifications and would be useful for studying physiological function of vitamin K.'\n",

      "Abstract :'G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with high EVI1 expression (EVI1 AML). Because GPR56 is a transcriptional target of EVI1 and silencing of GPR56 expression induces apoptosis, we developed a novel drug to suppress GPR56 expression in EVI1 AML cells. For this purpose, we generated pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides specific to GPR56 (PIP/56-1 or PIP/56-2) as nuclease-resistant novel compounds that interfere with the binding of EVI1 to the GPR56 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. Treatment of EVI1 AML cell lines (UCSD/AML1 and Kasumi-3) with PIP/56-1 or PIP/56-2 effectively suppressed GPR56 expression by inhibiting binding of EVI1 to its promoter, leading to suppression of cell growth with increased rates of apoptosis. Moreover, intravenous administration of PIP/56-1 into immunodeficient Balb/c-RJ mice subcutaneously transplanted with UCSD/AML1 cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and extended survival. Furthermore, organ infiltration by leukemia cells in immunodeficient Balb/c-RJ mice, which were intravenously transplanted using UCSD/AML1 cells, was successfully inhibited by PIP/56-1 treatment with no apparent effects on murine hematopoietic cells. In addition, PIP treatment did not inhibit colony formation of human CD34 progenitor cells. Thus, PI polyamide targeting of GPR56 using our compound is promising, useful, and safe for the treatment of EVI1 AML.'\n",

UVI31+, a novel UV-inducible DNA endonuclease in C. reinhardtii, which normally localizes near cell wall and pyrenoid regions, gets redistributed into punctate foci within the whole chloroplast, away from the pyrenoid, upon UV-stress. Solution NMR structure of the first putative UV inducible endonuclease UVI31+ revealed an α-β-β-α-α-β fold similar to BolA and type II KH-domain ubiquitous protein families. Three α-helices of UVI31+ constitute one side of the protein surface, which are packed to the other side, made of three-stranded β-sheet, with intervening hydrophobic residues. A twenty-three residues long polypeptide stretch (D54-H76) connecting β and β strands is found to be highly flexible. Interestingly, UVI31+ recognizes the DNA primarily through its β-sheet. We propose that the catalytic triad residues involving Ser114, His95 and Thr116 facilitate DNA endonuclease activity of UVI31+. Further, decreased endonuclease activity of the S114A mutant is consistent with the direct participation of Ser114 in the catalysis. This study provides the first structural description of a plant chloroplast endonuclease that is regulated by UV-stress response.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Previous studies of the N-terminal PDZ tandem from PSD-95 produced divergent models and failed to identify interdomain contacts stabilizing the structure. We used ensemble and single-molecule FRET along with replica-exchange molecular dynamics to fully characterize the energy landscape. Simulations and experiments identified two conformations: an open-like conformation with a small contact interface stabilized by salt bridges, and a closed-like conformation with a larger contact interface stabilized by surface-exposed hydrophobic residues. Both interfaces were confirmed experimentally. Proximity of interdomain contacts to the binding pockets may explain the observed coupling between conformation and binding. The low-energy barrier between conformations allows submillisecond dynamics, which were time-averaged in previous NMR and FRET studies. Moreover, the small contact interfaces were likely overridden by lattice contacts as crystal structures were rarely sampled in simulations. Our hybrid approach can identify transient interdomain interactions, which are abundant in multidomain proteins yet often obscured by dynamic averaging.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"CRISPR/Cas9 is a programmable nuclease composed of the Cas9 protein and a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule. To create a mutant potato, a powerful genome-editing system was required because potato has a tetraploid genome. The translational enhancer dMac3, consisting of a portion of the OsMac3 mRNA 5'-untranslated region, greatly enhanced the production of the protein encoded in the downstream ORF. To enrich the amount of Cas9, we applied the dMac3 translational enhancer to the Cas9 expression system with multiple gRNA genes. CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting the potato granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) gene examined the frequency of mutant alleles in transgenic potato plants. The efficiency of the targeted mutagenesis strongly increased when the dMac3-installed Cas9 was used. In this case, the ratio of transformants containing four mutant alleles reached approximately 25% when estimated by CAPS analysis. The mutants that exhibited targeted mutagenesis in the GBSSI gene showed characteristics of low amylose starch in their tubers. This result suggests that our system may facilitate genome-editing events in polyploid plants.\"\n",

Inflammation has been shown to be a key factor involved in the underlying pathophysiology of depression and has been shown in a substantial proportion of cases of depression. Changes attributed with morphological deformities and immunomodulation in susceptible regions of the depressed brain raised the possibility of altered cellular homeostasis transduced by the intracellular stress response. How emotional stressors can lead to an inflamed brain that directly affects physiology and activity is yet to be fully understood. The unfolded protein response (UPR) has been shown to be active in both models of depression as well as in postmortem brain of depressed individuals. The UPR is the cellular response to stress which results in misfolded proteins. Interestingly, UPR activation is directly linked to both inflammatory cytokine production and Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression. The TLRs are part of the innate immune response which typically reacts to \"classic invasions\" such as bacteria or viruses as well as trauma. TLRs have also been shown to be upregulated in depression, thus solidifying the connection between inflammation and depression. In this review, we aim to tie the UPR-TLR response and depression, and describe the implications of such an association.

A large number of patients suffer with cognitive disabilities and psychiatric conditions after TBI, especially anxiety and depression. The constellation of post-injury cognitive and behavioral symptoms suggest permanent effects of injury on neurotransmission. Guided in part by preclinical studies, clinical trials have focused on high-yield pathophysiologic mechanisms, including protein aggregation, inflammation, metabolic disruption, cell generation, physiology, and alterations in neurotransmitter signaling. Despite successful treatment of experimental TBI in animal models, clinical studies based on these findings have failed to translate to humans. The current international effort to reshape TBI research is focusing on redefining the taxonomy and characterization of TBI. In addition, as the next round of clinical trials is pending, there is a pressing need to consider what the field has learned over the past two decades of research, and how we can best capitalize on this knowledge to inform the hypotheses for future innovations. Thus, it is critically important to extend our understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI, particularly to mechanisms that are associated with recovery versus development of chronic symptoms. In this review, we focus on the pathology of neurotransmission after TBI, reflecting on what has been learned from both the preclinical and clinical studies, and we discuss new directions and opportunities for future work.'\n",

We examined agonist-induced mGluR5 signaling in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) derived from 17 patients and age-matched and sex-matched controls. The patient group showed a striking reduction in mGluR5 signaling, manifested by decreases in Gq/11 coupling and association with PI3K and Homer compared to controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01 for all). This was accompanied by increases in serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of mGluR5, which can decrease mGluR5 activity via desensitization (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). In addition, we find altered protein-protein interaction (PPI) of mGluR5 with RGS4, norbin, Preso 1 and tamalin, which can also attenuate mGluR5 activity. We previously reported molecular underpinnings of GluN hypofunction (decreased GluN2 phosphorylation) and here we show those of reduced mGluR5 signaling in schizophrenia. We find that reduced GluN2 phosphorylation can be precipitated by attenuated mGluR5 activity and that increased mGluR5 phosphorylation can result from decreased GluN function, suggesting a reciprocal interplay between the two pathways in schizophrenia. Interestingly, the patient group showed decreased mGluR5-GluN association (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01), a mechanistic basis for the reciprocal facilitation. In sum, we present the first direct evidence for mGluR5 hypoactivity, propose a reciprocal interplay between GluN and mGluR5 pathways as integral to glutamatergic dysregulation and suggest protein-protein interactions in mGluR5-GluN complexes as potential targets for intervention in schizophrenia.'\n",

Adverse food reactions can be divided according to their underlying pathophysiology into food intolerances, when, for instance, there is deficiency of a host enzyme required to digest the food component, and food sensitivities, when immune mechanisms are involved. In this Review, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence for enteric infections and/or alterations in the gut microbiota in inciting food sensitivity.

Biogas slurry increased the content of crude protein and starch in the grains. Both biogas slurry and peanut-shell biochar improved fluvo-aquic soil nutrient content, water-stable macroaggregates, and microbial population, which might be related to their high nutrient content, large specific surface area, adsorption capacity, and functional groups.

Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis and cell differentiation approaches underline GRG5 as a multifaceted signaling regulator that represses mesendodermal-related genes. When ESCs exit pluripotency, GRG5 promotes neuroectodermal specification via Wnt and BMP signaling suppression. Moreover, GRG5 promotes the neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts and maintains the self-renewal of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) by sustaining the activity of Notch/Hes and Stat3 signaling pathways. In summary, our results demonstrate that GRG5 has pleiotropic roles in stem cell biology functioning as a stemness factor and a neural fate specifier.'\n",

Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) stabilizes intracellular pH following induction by HIF-1α. Redox effector factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a multifunctional protein with redox signaling activity that converts certain oxidized transcription factors to a reduced state, enabling them to upregulate tumor-promoting genes. Our studies evaluate PDAC hypoxia responses and APE1/Ref-1 redox signaling contributions to HIF-1α-mediated CA9 transcription. Our previous studies implicated this pathway in PDAC cell survival under hypoxia. We expand those studies, comparing drug responses using patient-derived PDAC cells displaying differential hypoxic responses in 3D spheroid tumor-stroma models to characterize second generation APE1/Ref-1 redox signaling and CA9 inhibitors. Our data demonstrates that HIF-1α-mediated CA9 induction differs between patient-derived PDAC cells and that APE1/Ref-1 redox inhibition attenuates this induction by decreasing hypoxia-induced HIF-1 DNA binding.

      "Abstract :'This contribution describes the growth of oocytes, addressing the formation of structures that compose the follicular complex, as well as the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, specifically laminin, fibronectin and type IV collagen during gonadal maturation. Thirty-seven females of the Acari zebra fish, Hypancistrus zebra were captured and the ovaries were submitted to histological processing for light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry techniques. Oogonia and four stages (I - IV) of oocytes were distinguished, and structures such as the postovulatory follicle and atretic oocytes (initial and advanced atresia) were observed. The follicular complex consists of the mature oocyte, zona radiata (Zr1, Zr2 and Zr3), follicular cells, basement membrane and theca. During oocyte growth, proteins of the extracellular matrix showed different intensities of staining. Based on these observations, a model of oocyte growth is proposed to define specific characteristics of the oocyte and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in the ovary of H. zebra. This model of oocyte growth can be extended to other species of ornamental fishes. This study contributes data for induced fertilization and eventual conservation of this species.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have made it possible to perform genome wide identification of somatic mutation in cancers. Most studies focus on identifying somatic mutations in the protein coding portion of the genome using whole exome sequencing (WES). Every human genome has around 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A sizeable fraction of these germline SNPs is very rare and will not be found in the databases. Thus, in order to unambiguously identify somatic mutation, it is absolutely necessary to know the germline SNPs of the patient. While a blood sample can serve as source of germline DNA from patients with solid tumours, obtaining germline DNA from patients with haematological malignancies is very difficult. Tumor cells often infiltrate the skin, and their DNA can be found in saliva and buccal swab samples. The DNA in the tips of nails stems from keratinocytes that have undergone keratinization several months ago. DNA was successfully extracted from nail clippings of 5 probands for WES. We were able to identify somatic mutations in one tumor exome by using the nail exome as germline reference. Our results demonstrate that nail DNA is a reliable source of germline DNA in the setting of hematological malignancies.'\n",

In addition, we provide a list of putative transcription cofactors derived from known interactions with the identified TFs.

However, studies in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), associated with a high incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis, are scarce. Therefore, we assessed the association of CPT with subclinical atherosclerosis and metabolic risk factors in axSpA. CPT serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 163 axSpA patients and 63 controls. Subclinical atherosclerosis was determined in patients by carotid ultrasonography (assessing the presence/absence of carotid plaques and carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT]). Data on inflammation, disease activity, lipid profile and treatment were collected to evaluate its relationship with CPT. axSpA patients evidenced lower CPT levels than controls. CPT showed no association with plaques or cIMT in axSpA. CPT and HDL-cholesterol negatively correlated, while a positive association of CPT with the atherogenic index was disclosed. Additionally, axSpA patients with C-reactive protein values at diagnosis higher than 3\\u2009mg/L displayed higher CPT levels. Our study shows no relationship between CPT and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in axSpA. Nevertheless, it demonstrates an association of CPT with adverse lipid profiles and inflammatory biomarkers, which could further influence on the development of atherosclerosis.'\n",

Here, we present a method based on APTES-glutaraldehyde coating of glass surfaces to immobilize cells without compromising their growth. Our method of immobilization is compatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and synthetic cells (here, giant-unilamellar vesicles). The method introduces minimal background fluorescence and is suitable for imaging of single particles at high resolution. With S. cerevisiae we benchmarked the method against the commonly used concanavalin A approach. We show by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy that modifying surfaces with ConA introduces artifacts close to the glass surface, which are not present when immobilizing with the APTES-glutaraldehyde method. We demonstrate validity of the method by measuring the diffusion of membrane proteins in yeast with single-particle tracking and of lipids in giant-unilamellar vesicles with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Importantly, the physical properties and shape of the fragile GUVs are not affected upon binding to APTES-glutaraldehyde coated glass. The APTES-glutaraldehyde is a generic method of immobilization that should work with any cell or synthetic system that has primary amines on the surface.'\n"

To this end, a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line (HTLA-230) was treated with increasing etoposide concentrations and an etoposide-resistant cell line (HTLA-ER) was obtained. HTLA-ER cells, following etoposide exposure, evaded apoptosis by altering Bax/Bcl2 ratio. While both cell populations shared a homozygous TP53 mutation encoding a partially-functioning protein, a mono-allelic deletion of 13q14.3 locus, where the P53 inducible miRNAs 15a/16-1 are located, and the consequent miRNA down-regulation were detected only in HTLA-ER cells. This event correlated with BMI-1 oncoprotein up-regulation which caused a decrease in p16 tumor suppressor content and a metabolic adaptation of HTLA-ER cells. These results, taken collectively, highlight the role of miRNAs 15a/16-1 as markers of chemoresistance.'\n",

Distinct efficacy profiles showed different therapeutic effects on CB1 dependent on three classes of ligands: agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. To discriminate the distinct efficacy profiles of the ligands, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify the dynamic behaviors of inactive and active conformations of CB1 structures with the ligands. In addition, the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method was applied to analyze the binding free energy decompositions of the CB1-ligand complexes. With these two methods, we found the possibility that the three classes of ligands can be discriminated. Our findings shed light on the understanding of different efficacy profiles of ligands by analyzing the structural behaviors of intact CB1 structures and the binding energies of ligands, thereby yielding insights that are useful for the design of new potent CB1 drugs.'\n",

TTR levels are lower in the CSF of AD patients. Zn, Mn and Fe transform TTR into a protease able to cleave Aβ. To explain these activities, monomer dissociation or conformational changes have been suggested. Here, we report that when TTR crystals are exposed to copper or iron salts, the tetramer undergoes a significant conformational change that alters the dimer-dimer interface and rearranges residues implicated in TTR's ability to neutralize Aβ. We also describe the conformational changes in TTR upon the binding of the various metal ions. Furthermore, using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) with immobilized Aβ(1-28), we observe the binding of TTR only in the presence of copper. Such Cu-dependent binding suggests a recognition mechanism whereby Cu modulates both the TTR conformation, induces a complementary Aβ structure and may participate in the interaction. Cu-soaked TTR crystals show a conformation different from that induced by Fe, and intriguingly, TTR crystals grown in presence of Aβ(1-28) show different positions for the copper sites from those grown its absence.\"\n",

Nearly 70% of these stones are primarily composed of calcium oxalate, a mineral previously assumed to be effectively insoluble within the kidney. This has limited currently available treatment options to painful passage and/or invasive surgical procedures. We analyze kidney stone thin sections with a combination of optical techniques, which include bright field, polarization, confocal and super-resolution nanometer-scale auto-fluorescence microscopy. Here we demonstrate using interdisciplinary geology and biology (geobiology) approaches that calcium oxalate stones undergo multiple events of dissolution as they crystallize and grow within the kidney. These observations open a fundamentally new paradigm for clinical approaches that include in vivo stone dissolution and identify high-frequency layering of organic matter and minerals as a template for biomineralization in natural and engineered settings.'\n",

The mechanisms that regulate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent activity, oligomerization and post-translational modifications in this family of enzymes are yet unknown. We present the first crystallographic structure of full-length human RuvBL2 which provides novel insights into its mechanistic action and biology. The ring-shaped hexameric RuvBL2 structure presented here resolves for the first time the mobile domain II of the human protein, which is responsible for protein-protein interactions and ATPase activity regulation. Structural analysis suggests how ATP binding may lead to domain II motion through interactions with conserved N-terminal loop histidine residues. Furthermore, a comparison between hsRuvBL1 and 2 shows differences in surface charge distribution that may account for previously described differences in regulation. Analytical ultracentrifugation and cryo electron microscopy analyses performed on hsRuvBL2 highlight an oligomer plasticity that possibly reflects different physiological conformations of the protein in the cell, as well as that single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can promote the oligomerization of monomeric hsRuvBL2. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism for ATP binding and domain II conformational change coupling.'\n",

However, the labile state has a very narrow time window after retrieval, and underlying molecular mechanisms are not well known. To that end, we isolated the hippocampus immediately after fear memory retrieval and performed proteomics. We identified Neurobeachin (NBEA), an autism-related regulator of synaptic protein trafficking, to be upregulated after contextual fear memory retrieval. NBEA protein expression was rapid and transient after fear memory retrieval at the synapse. Nbea mRNA was enriched at the synapses, and the rapid induction of NBEA expression was blocked by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling pathway. Mice with cornu ammonis 1 (CA1)-specific Nbea shRNA knockdown showed normal fear acquisition and contextual fear memory but impaired extinction, suggesting an important role of Nbea in fear memory extinction processes. Consistently, Nbea heterozygotes showed normal fear acquisition and fear memory recall but showed impairment in extinction. Our data suggest that NBEA is necessary either for induction of memory lability or for the physiological process of memory extinction.'\n",

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that hydrogen polysulfanes released from nano-iron sulfides possess potent bactericidal activity and the release of polysulfanes can be accelerated by the enzyme-like activity of nano-iron sulfides. Finally, we demonstrate that topical applications of nano-iron sulfides can effectively disrupt pathogenic biofilms on human teeth and accelerate infected-wound healing.

Meteorin-like protein (METRNL), a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn, is induced after exercise in the skeletal muscle. Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired insulin response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake. METRNL treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and PPARδ expression both in differentiated C2C12 cells and mouse skeletal muscle. siRNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and PPARδ abrogated the suppressive effects of METRNL on palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Moreover, METRNL augmented the mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation-associated genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3). siRNAs for AMPK and PPARδ reversed these changes. In the current study, we report for the first time that METRNL alleviates inflammation and insulin resistance and induces fatty acid oxidation through AMPK or PPARδ-dependent signaling in skeletal muscle.'\n",

Here we describe the development of antibody fragments that bind and stabilize GPCR-G protein complexes for the application of high-resolution cryo-EM. One antibody in particular, mAb16, stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes by recognizing an interface between Gα and Gβγ subunits in the heterotrimer, and confers resistance to GTPγS-triggered dissociation. The unique recognition mode of this antibody makes it possible to transfer its binding and stabilizing effect to other G-protein subtypes through minimal protein engineering.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on the microarray data GSE9115, GSE65144, and GSE53072 derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ATC samples and normal controls were identified. With DEGs, we performed a series of functional enrichment analyses. Then, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and visualized, with which the hub gene nodes were screened out. Finally, modules analysis for the PPI network was performed to further investigate the potential relationships between DEGs and ATC. RESULTS A total of 537 common DEGs were screened out from all 3 datasets, among which 247 genes were upregulated and 275 genes were downregulated. GO analysis indicated that upregulated DEGs were mainly involved in cell division and mitotic nuclear division and the downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in ventricular cardiac muscle cell action potential. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in cell cycle and ECM-receptor interaction and the downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in thyroid hormone synthesis, insulin resistance, and pathways in cancer. The top 10 hub genes in the constructed PPI network were CDK1, CCNB1, TOP2A, AURKB, CCNA2, BUB1, AURKA, CDC20, MAD2L1, and BUB1B. The modules analysis showed that genes in the top 2 significant modules of PPI network were mainly associated with mitotic cell cycle and positive regulation of mitosis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We identified a series of key genes along with the pathways that were most closely related with ATC initiation and progression.

Spastin binds to microtubules and severs them through the enzymatic activity of its AAA domain. Several missense mutations located in this domain lead to stable, nonsevering spastins that decorate a subset of microtubules, suggesting a possible negative gain-of-function mechanism for these mutants. Of the two main isoforms of spastin, only mutations of the long isoform, M1, are supposed to be involved in the onset of the pathology, leaving the role of the ubiquitously expressed shorter one, M87, not fully investigated and understood. Here, we show that two isoforms of spastin harboring the same missense mutation bind and bundle different subsets of microtubules in HeLa cells, and likely stabilize them by increasing the level of acetylated tubulin. However, only mutated M1 has the ability to interact with wild-type M1, and decorates a subset of perinuclear microtubules associated with the endoplasmic reticulum that display higher resistance to microtubule depolymerization and increased intracellular ionic strength, compared with those decorated by mutated M87. We further show that only mutated M1 decorates microtubules of proximal axons and dendrites, and strongly impairs axonal transport in cortical neurons through a mechanism likely independent of the microtubule-severing activity of this protein.'\n",

The p.R745C variant within the tyrosine kinase domain was associated with defects in platelet aggregation, αIIbβ3 activation and granule secretion induced by GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors) agonists and convulxin as well as in thrombus formation on collagen under flow. In contrast, clot retraction, flow-dependent platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen were only mildly affected indicating limited effects on αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Most importantly, Lyn, Syk and FcRγ phosphorylation, the initial steps in GPVI platelet signaling were drastically impaired in the absence of platelet-platelet contact indicating a positive role for EPHB2 in GPVI activation. Likewise platelet activation by PAR4-AP showed defective Src activation, as opposed to normal PKCs activity and Ca mobilization. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) and R745C EPHB2 variant in RBL-2H3 cells (Rat Basophilic Leukemia cells) stably expressing human GPVI, confirmed EPHB2 R745C mutation impaired EPHB2 autophosphorylation, but had no effect on ephrin ligand-induced EPHB2 clustering, suggesting it did not interfere with EPHB2-ephrin-mediated cell-to-cell contact.

We focused on one of these miRNAs, namely , which was uniformly down-modulated in all examined tFL (~3.5-folds, n=13 pairs), and observed that high levels of MYC are responsible for repressing  in tFL by binding in its upstream region.

      "Abstract :'Systemic iron balance is controlled by hepcidin, a liver hormone that limits iron efflux to the bloodstream by promoting degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin in target cells. Iron-dependent hepcidin induction requires hemojuvelin (HJV), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor that is disrupted in juvenile hemochromatosis, causing dramatic hepcidin deficiency and tissue iron overload. Hjv-/- mice recapitulate phenotypic hallmarks of hemochromatosis but exhibit blunted hepcidin induction following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. We show that Hjv-/- mice fail to mount an appropriate hypoferremic response to acute inflammation caused by LPS, the lipopeptide FSL1 or E. coli infection, because residual hepcidin does not suffice to drastically decrease macrophage ferroportin levels. Hfe-/- mice, a model of milder hemochromatosis, exhibit almost wild type inflammatory hepcidin expression and associated effects, while double Hjv-/-Hfe-/- mice phenocopy single Hjv-/- counterparts. In primary murine hepatocytes, Hjv deficiency does not affect IL-6/Stat, and only slightly inhibits BMP2/Smad signaling to hepcidin; however, it severely impairs BMP6/Smad signaling and thereby abolishes synergism with the IL-6/Stat pathway. Inflammatory induction of hepcidin is suppressed in iron-deficient wild type mice and recovers after the animals are provided overnight access to an iron-rich diet. We conclude that Hjv is required for inflammatory induction of hepcidin and controls the acute hypoferremic response by maintaining a threshold of Bmp6/Smad signaling. Our data highlight Hjv as a potential pharmacological target against anemia of inflammation.'\n",

The channel consists of 10 transmembrane (TM) segments of the Sec61α subunit and possesses an opening between TM2b and TM7, termed the lateral gate. Structural and biochemical analyses of complexes of Sec61 and its ortholog SecY have revealed that the lateral gate is the exit for signal sequences and TM segments of translocating polypeptides to the lipid bilayer and also involved in the recognition of such hydrophobic sequences. Moreover, even marginally hydrophobic (mH) segments insufficient for membrane integration can be transiently stalled in surrounding Sec61α regions and cross-linked to them, but how the Sec61 translocon accommodates these mH segments remains unclear. Here, we used Cys-scanned variants of human Sec61α expressed in cultured 293-H cells to examine which channel regions associate with mH segments. A TM segment in a ribosome-associated polypeptide was mainly cross-linked to positions at the lateral gate, whereas an mH segment in a nascent chain was cross-linked to the Sec61α pore-interior positions at TM5 and TM10, as well as the lateral gate. Of note, cross-linking at position 180 in TM5 of Sec61α was reduced by an I179A substitution. We therefore conclude that at least two Sec61α regions, the lateral gate and the pore-interior site around TM5, interact with mH segments and are involved in accommodating them.'\n"

      "Abstract :'The Nedd4 family E3 ligases Itch and WWP1/2 play crucial roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and are closely correlated with cancer development and metastasis. It has been recently shown that the ligase activities of Itch and WWP1/2 are tightly regulated with the HECT domain sequestered intramolecularly by a linker region connecting WW2 and WW3. Here, we show that a similar autoinhibitory mechanism is utilized by the Drosophila ortholog of Itch and WWP1/2, Suppressor of Deltex [Su(dx)]. We show that Su(dx) adopts an inactive steady state with the WW domain region interacting with the HECT domain. We demonstrate that both the linker and preceding WW2 are required for the efficient binding and regulation of Su(dx) HECT. Recruiting the multiple PY motif-containing adaptor dNdfip via WW domains relieves the inhibitory state of Su(dx) and leads to substrate (e.g., Notch) ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates an evolutionarily conservative mechanism governing the regulation and activation of some Nedd4 family E3 ligases. Our results also suggest a dual regulatory mechanism for specific Notch downregulation via dNdfip-Su(dx)-mediated Notch ubiquitination.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are closely related hormones involved in the regulation of metabolism and growth. They elicit their functions through activation of tyrosine kinase-type receptors: insulin receptors (IR-A and IR-B) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Despite similarity in primary and three-dimensional structures, insulin and IGF-1 bind the non-cognate receptor with substantially reduced affinity. We prepared [D-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin, which binds all three receptors with high affinity (251 % or 338 % binding affinity to IR-A respective to IR-B relative to insulin, and 12.4 % binding affinity to IGF-1R relative to IGF-1). We prepared other modified insulins with the aim of explaining the versatility of [D-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin. Through structural, activity and kinetic studies of these insulin analogs, we concluded that the ability of [D-HisB24, GlyB31, TyrB32]-insulin to stimulate all three receptors is provided by structural changes caused by a reversed chirality at the B24 combined with the extension of the C-terminus of B chain by two extra residues. We assume that the structural changes allow the directing of the B chain C-terminus to some extra-interactions with the receptors. These unusual interactions lead to a decrease of dissociation rate from IR and conversely enable easier association with IGF-1R. All the structural changes were made at the hormones' Site 1, which is thought to interact with the Site 1 of the receptors. The results of the study suggest that merely modifications of Site 1 of the hormone are sufficient to change the receptor-specificity of insulin.\"\n",

These proteins commonly prevent association of eIF4E with eIF4G or form repressive messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) that exclude the translation machinery. Such gene-regulatory mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins other than eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E), are unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein, conserved binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1). We found that CBE1 has an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E-binding motif in its N-terminal domain and binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E  CBE1 thereby forms cap-binding complexes and is an eIF4E-dependent constituent of these complexes  Of note, plant mutants lacking CBE1 exhibited dysregulation of cell cycle-related transcripts and accumulated higher levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitosis than did wildtype plants. Our findings indicate that CBE1 is a plant protein that can form mRNA cap-binding complexes having the potential for regulating gene expression. Since mammalian translation factors are known regulators of cell cycle progression, we propose that CBE1 may represent the first translation factor-associated plant-specific cell cycle regulator.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Mammalian sperm must undergo capacitation as a preparation for entering into hyperactivated motility, undergoing the acrosome reaction, and acquiring fertilizing ability. One of the initial capacitation events occurs when sperm encounter an elevated HCO3- concentration. This anion activates the atypical adenylyl cyclase Adcy10, increases intracellular cAMP, and stimulates protein kinase A (PKA). Moreover, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is essential for sperm capacitation. Although a crosstalk between cAMP-dependent pathways and Ca2+ clearly plays an essential role in sperm capacitation, the connection between these signaling events is incompletely understood. Here, using three different approaches, we found that CatSper, the main sperm Ca2+ channel characterized to date, is upregulated by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA in mouse sperm. First, HCO3- and the PKA-activating permeable compound 8-Br-cAMP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, which was blocked by the PKA peptide inhibitor PKI;H89, another PKA inhibitor also abrogated the 8-Br-cAMP response. Second, HCO3- increased the membrane depolarization induced upon divalent cation removal, by promoting influx of monovalent cations through CatSper channels, which was inhibited by PKI, H89, and the CatSper blocker HC-056456. Third, electrophysiological patch-camp, whole-cell recordings revealed that CatSper activity is up-regulated by HCO3- and by direct cAMP injection through the patch-clamp pipette. The activation by HCO3- and cAMP was also blocked by PKI, H89, Rp-cAMPS and HC-056456, and electrophysiological recordings in sperm from CatSper-KO mice confirmed CatSper's role in these activation modes. Our results strongly suggest that PKA-dependent phosphorylation regulates [Ca2+]i homeostasis by activating CatSper channel complexes.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The molecular chaperones are central mediators of protein homeostasis. In that role, they engage in widespread protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with each other and with their \"client\" proteins. Together, these PPIs form the backbone of a network that ensures proper vigilance over the processes of protein folding, trafficking, quality control and degradation. The core chaperones, such as the heat shock proteins Hsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90, are widely expressed in most tissues, yet there is growing evidence that the PPIs among them may be re-wired in disease conditions. This possibility suggests that these PPIs, and perhaps not the individual chaperones themselves, could be compelling drug targets. Indeed, recent efforts have yielded small molecules that inhibit (or promote) a subset of inter-chaperone PPIs. These chemical probes are being used to study chaperone networks in a range of models and the successes with these approaches have inspired a community-wide objective to produce inhibitors for a broader set of targets. In this review, we discuss progress towards that goal and point out some of the challenges ahead.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Most retinoblastomas initiate in response to the inactivation of the  gene and loss of functional RB protein. The tumors may form with few additional genomic changes and develop after a premalignant retinoma phase. Despite this seemingly straightforward etiology, mouse models have not recapitulated the genetic, cellular, and stage-specific features of human retinoblastoma genesis. For example, whereas human retinoblastomas appear to derive from cone photoreceptor precursors, current mouse models develop tumors that derive from other retinal cell types. To investigate the basis of the human cone-specific oncogenesis, we compared developmental stage-specific cone precursor responses to RB loss in human and murine retina cultures and in cone-specific -knockout mice. We report that RB-depleted maturing (ARR3) but not immature (ARR3) human cone precursors enter the cell cycle, proliferate, and form retinoblastoma-like lesions with Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, then form low or nonproliferative premalignant retinoma-like lesions with fleurettes and p16 and p130 expression, and finally form highly proliferative retinoblastoma-like masses. In contrast, in murine retina, only RB-depleted immature (Arr3) cone precursors entered the cell cycle, and they failed to progress from S to M phase. Moreover, whereas intrinsically highly expressed MDM2 and MYCN contribute to RB-depleted maturing (ARR3) human cone precursor proliferation, ectopic MDM2 and Mycn promoted only immature (Arr3) murine cone precursor cell-cycle entry. These findings demonstrate that developmental stage-specific as well as species- and cell type-specific features sensitize to  inactivation and reveal the human cone precursors' capacity to model retinoblastoma initiation, proliferation, premalignant arrest, and tumor growth.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The repertoire of peptides displayed at the cell surface by MHC I molecules is shaped by two intracellular peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR. While cell-free assays have proven extremely useful in identifying the function of both of these proteins, here we explored whether a more physiological system could be developed to assess TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing on MHC I. We reveal that membrane-associated TAPBPR targeted to the plasma membrane retains its ability to function as a peptide editor and efficiently catalyzes peptide exchange on surface-expressed MHC I molecules. Additionally, we show that soluble TAPBPR, consisting of the luminal domain alone, added to intact cells, also functions as an effective peptide editor on surface MHC I molecules. Thus, we have established two systems in which TAPBPR-mediated peptide exchange on MHC class I can be interrogated. Furthermore, we could use both plasma membrane-targeted and exogenous soluble TAPBPR to display immunogenic peptides on surface MHC I molecules and consequently induce T cell receptor engagement, IFN-γ secretion, and T cell-mediated killing of target cells. Thus, we have developed an efficient way to by-pass the natural antigen presentation pathway of cells and load immunogenic peptides of choice onto cells. Our findings highlight a potential therapeutic use for TAPBPR in increasing the immunogenicity of tumors in the future.'\n",

So far, cetuximab is the only approved anti-EGFR mAb used for the treatment of HNSCC, but despite the benefits of adding it to standard treatment regimens, attempts to define a predictive biomarker to stratify patients for cetuximab treatment have been unsuccessful. We hypothesized that imaging with EGFR-specific radioligands may facilitate non-invasive measurement of EGFR expression across the entire tumor burden and also allow for dynamic monitoring of cetuximab-mediated changes in receptor expression.  EGFR-specific Affibody molecule (ZEGFR:03115) was radiolabeled with zirconium-89 (Zr) and fluorine-18 (F). The radioligands were characterized in vitro and in mice bearing subcutaneous tumors with varying levels of EGFR expression. The protein dose for imaging studies was assessed by injecting Zr-DFO-ZEGFR:03115 (2.4-3.6 MBq, 2 µg) either together with or 30 mins after increasing amounts of unlabeled ZEGFR:03115 (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 µg). PET images were acquired at 3, 24 and 48 h post-injection and the image quantification data were correlated with the biodistribution results. The EGFR expression and biodistribution of the tracer were assessed ex vivo by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and autoradiography. To downregulate the EGFR level, treatment with cetuximab was performed and F-AlF-NOTA-ZEGFR:03115 (12 µg, 1.5-2 MBq/mouse) used to monitor receptor changes.  In vivo studies demonstrated that co-injecting 10 µg of non-labeled molecules with Zr-DFO-ZEGFR:03115 allows for clear tumor visualization 3 h post-injection. The radioconjugate tumor accumulation was EGFR-specific and PET imaging data showed a clear differentiation between xenografts with varying EGFR expression levels. A strong correlation was observed between PET analysis, ex vivo estimates of tracer concentration and receptor expression in tumor tissues. Additionally, F-AlF-NOTA-ZEGFR:03115 could measure receptor downregulation in response to EGFR inhibition.  ZEGFR03115-based radioconjugates can assess different levels of EGFR level in vivo and measure receptor expression changes in response to cetuximab, indicating a potential for assessment of adequate treatment dosing with anti-EGFR antibodies.'\n",

PET imaging was performed in rhesus monkeys at baseline and after administration of either thiamet G, a potent OGA inhibitor, or nonradioactive LSN3316612. The density of the enzyme was calculated as distribution volume (VT) using a two-tissue compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. The radiation burden for future studies was calculated based on whole-body imaging of monkeys. Oga∆Br, a mouse brain-specific knockout of Oga, was also scanned to assess the specificity of the radioligand for its target enzyme.  Uptake of radioactivity in monkey brain was high (~5 SUV) and followed by slow washout. The highest uptake was in the amygdala, followed by striatum and hippocampus. Pretreatment with thiamet G or nonradioactive LSN3316612 reduced brain uptake to a low and uniform concentration in all regions, corresponding to an approximately 90% decrease in VT. Whole-body imaging in rhesus monkeys showed high uptake in kidney, spleen, liver, and testes. In Oga∆Br mice, brain uptake of F-LSN3316612 was reduced by 82% compared to control mice. Peripheral organs were unaffected in Oga∆Br mice, consistent with loss of OGA expression exclusively in the brain. The effective dose of F- LSN3316612 in humans was calculated to be 22 µSv/MBq, which is typical for F-labeled radioligands.  These results show that F-LSN3316612 is an excellent radioligand for imaging and quantifying OGA in rhesus monkeys and mice. Based on these data, F-LSN3316612 merits evaluation in humans.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'The functional maturation of spermatozoa that is necessary to achieve fertilization occurs as they transit through the epididymis, a highly specialized region of the male reproductive tract. A defining feature of this maturation process is that it occurs in the complete absence of nuclear gene transcription or  protein translation in the spermatozoa. Rather, it is driven by sequential interactions between spermatozoa and the complex external milieu in which they are bathed within lumen of the epididymal tubule. A feature of this dynamic microenvironment are epididymosomes, small membrane encapsulated vesicles that are secreted from the epididymal soma. Herein, we report comparative proteomic profiling of epididymosomes isolated from different segments of the mouse epididymis using multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) based quantification coupled with high resolution LC-MS/MS. A total of 1640 epididymosome proteins were identified and quantified via this proteomic method. Notably, this analysis revealed pronounced segment-to-segment variation in the encapsulated epididymosome proteome. Thus, 146 proteins were identified as being differentially accumulated between caput and corpus epididymosomes, and a further 344 were differentially accumulated between corpus and cauda epididymosomes (i.e. fold change of \\xa0-1.5 or \\xa01.5; P < 0.05). Application of gene ontology annotation revealed a substantial portion of the epididymosome proteins mapped to the cellular component of extracellular exosome and to the biological processes of transport, oxidation-reduction, and metabolism. Additional annotation of the subset of epididymosome proteins that have not previously been identified in exosomes revealed enrichment of categories associated with the acquisition of sperm function (e.g. fertilization and binding to the zona pellucida). In tandem with our demonstration that epididymosomes are able to convey protein cargo to the head of maturing spermatozoa, these data emphasize the fundamental importance of epididymosomes as key elements of the epididymal microenvironment responsible for coordinating post-testicular sperm maturation.'\n"

Culture media conditioned by podocytes exposed to high glucose caused glomerular endothelial vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1) upregulation and was enriched for the chemokine CCL2. A neutralizing anti-CCL2 antibody prevented VCAM-1 upregulation in cultured glomerular endothelial cells and knockout of the CCL2 receptor, CCR2 diminished glomerular VCAM-1 upregulation in diabetic mice. CCL2/CCR2 signaling induced glomerular endothelial VCAM-1 upregulation through a pathway regulated by p38 MAPK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases 1/2 (MSK1/2) and phosphorylation of H3Ser10; whereas MSK1/2 inhibition decreased H3Ser10 phosphorylation at the  promoter.

In addition, there is intriguing evidence of endogenous peptides/proteins that may target this region at the M2 mAChR. A common feature of synthetic and endogenous M2 mAChR negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) is their cationic nature. Using a structure-based approach, we previously designed a mutant M2 mAChR (N410K+T423K) to specifically abrogate binding of ECV cationic modulators (Dror et al. 2013). Herein, we utilized this \"allosteric site-impaired\" receptor to investigate allosteric interactions of synthetic modulators, as well as the basic peptides, poly-L-arginine (PLA) and endogenously-produced protamine and major basic protein. Using [3H]N-methylscopolamine equilibrium and kinetic binding, and functional assays of [35S]GTPγS binding and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we found modest effects of the mutations on potencies of orthosteric antagonists and an increase in the affinity of the cognate agonist, acetylcholine, likely reflecting the effect of the mutations on the access/egress of these ligands into the orthosteric pocket. More importantly, we noted a significant abrogation in affinity for all synthetic or peptidic modulators at the mutant mAChR, validating their allosteric nature. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for a hitherto-unappreciated role of endogenous cationic peptides interacting allosterically at the M2 mAChR, and identify the \"allosteric site-impaired\" GPCR as a tool for validating NAM activity, as well as a potential candidate for future chemogenetic strategies to understand the physiology of endogenous allosteric substances.'\n",

The cause of neuroblastoma is thought to lie in aberrant development of embryonic neural crest cells and is accompanied by low MHC-1 expression and suppression of the NF-κB transcription factor, thereby gearing cells towards escape from immunosurveillance. Here we assess regulation of the MHC-1 gene in neuroblastoma to enhance its immunogenic potential for therapeutic T-cell targeting. A genome-wide CRISPR screen identified N4BP1 and TNIP1 as inhibitory factors of NF-κB-mediated MHC-1 expression in neuroblastoma. Advanced stage neuroblastoma patients who expressed high levels of TNIP1 and N4BP1 exhibited worse overall survival. Depletion of N4BP1 or TNIP1 increased NF-κB and MHC-1 expression and stimulated recognition by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We confirmed that TNIP1 inhibited canonical NF-κB member RelA by preventing activation of the RelA/p50 NF-κB dimer. Furthermore, N4BP1 inhibited both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB through binding of deubiquitinating enzyme CEZANNE, resulting in stabilization of TRAF3 and degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK. These data suggest N4BP1/CEZANNE or TNIP1 may be candidate targets for immunotherapy in neuroblastoma tumors and should lift NF-κB suppression, thereby triggering increased peptide/MHC1-mediated tumor reactivity to enhance therapeutic T cell targeting.'\n",

To further investigate the methylation and expression of non-clustered PCDHs encoding genes in H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis process, four candidate genes including PCDH7, PCDH10, PCDH17 and PCDH20 were selected, which were reported to be tumor suppressors for digestive cancers. A total of 747 participants with a spectrum of gastric lesions were enrolled from a high-risk population of gastric cancer. Promoter methylation levels of four genes were significantly higher in H. pylori positive subjects than the negative group (all P<0.001). Elevated methylation levels of PCDH10 and PCDH17 were observed with the increasing severity of gastric lesions (both Ptrend<0.001). In the protein expression analysis, PCDH17 expression was inversely associated with gastric lesions; the OR (95% CI) was 0.49 (0.26-0.95) for chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), 0.31 (0.15-0.63) for intestinal metaplasia, and 0.38 (0.19-0.75) for indefinite dysplasia and dysplasia, compared with superficial gastritis (SG). In addition, PCDH10 expression was significantly lower in CAG (OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.24-0.68). The inverse association between methylation and protein expression of PCDH10 and PCDH17 was further supported when we explored the methylation and mRNA expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas database (all P<0.001). Our study found elevated promoter methylation and decreased expression of PCDH10 and PCDH17 in advanced gastric lesions, suggesting that elevated PCDH10 and PCDH17 methylation may be an early event in gastric carcinogenesis.'\n",

      "Abstract :'We report a case of a 17-year-old Caucasian girl with syndromic features of clinically unrecognized Kabuki syndrome (KS), who developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Diagnosis of KS was established after whole exome sequencing (WES) and detection of de novo frameshift 1bp deletion in histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D). The pathogenic variant in exon 34 (c.8626delC: 55 reads C, 56 reads delC), has not been described previously and is predicted to truncate the protein (p.Gln2876Serfs*34) resulting in KMT2D loss of function. Notwithstanding that patients with KS have a substantial susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an SLE and KS association. The exact relationship between the two conditions in our patient is difficult to determine with certainty, as a number of clinical features, including positive antiphospholipid antibodies, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and the episode of convulsions may occur in both conditions, suggesting potential overlap of KS and SLE. The combination of a high susceptibility towards infections and an autoimmune disorder present a great challenge when trying to achieve the optimum therapy which will enable the patient to stay on the thin line of remission. This case report emphasizes the value of WES as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of rare disorders and/or unusual disease presentations of possible genetic cause.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The primary cilium is a cellular antenna found on the surface of many eukaryotic cells, whose main role is to sense and transduce signals that regulate growth, development, and differentiation. Although once believed to be a vestigial organelle without important function, it has become clear that defects in primary cilium are responsible for a wide variety of genetic diseases affecting many organs and tissues, including the brain, eyes, heart, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The primary cilium is mainly present in quiescent and differentiated cells, and controls must exist to ensure that this organelle is assembled or disassembled at the right time. Although many protein components required for building the cilium have been identified, mechanistic details of how these proteins are spatially and temporally regulated and how these regulations are connected to external cues are beginning to emerge. This review article highlights the role of ubiquitination and in particular, E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases, in the control of primary cilia assembly and disassembly.'\n",

Pretreatment and post-treatment biopsy was obtained and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for SOX-2, OCT-4, Nanog, CD44 and Podoplanin. All patients received concurrent radiation and brachytherapy to an equivalent dose of 80-84 Gy to point A with concurrent weekly cisplatin. Correlation of cancer stem cell (CSC) expression was performed with known prognostic factors. Impact of stem cell expression on disease outcomes was tested within multivariate analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were included. The median dose to point A was 83Gy (46-89 Gy) and median of 4 (0-6) cycles of chemotherapy were administered. At baseline moderate to strong IHC expression of SOX-2, OCT-4, Nanog, CD44 and Podoplanin was observed in 12.8%, 4.8%, 24.4%, 15.5 % and 1.3% patients respectively. At median follow up of 30 months (3-51 months), loco-regional and distant relapse was observed in 12.2% and 23.1%. Of these 4.7% had both local and distant relapse. The 3-year disease free survival was 87%. On multivariate analysis moderate to high CSC expression and CD44 low status (HR=8.8 (95% CI 1.0-77.2), p<0.04) independently predicted for loco-regional relapse free survival. FIGO stage (HR=2.6 (95% CI1.3-5.4, p=0.004)) and presence of residual tumour after external radiation (HR= 3.5 (95% CI 1.8-6.5, p=0.0001) predicted for detriment in DFS.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Presence of stem cell proteins and loss of CD44 independently predicts for reduced loco-regional control in locally advanced cervix cancer.

      "Abstract :'During musculoskeletal system development, mechanical tension is generated between muscles and tendon-cells. This tension is required for muscle differentiation and is counterbalanced by tendon-cells avoiding tissue deformation. Both, Jbug/Filamin, an actin-meshwork organizing protein, and non-muscle Myosin-II (Myo-II) are required to maintain the shape and cell orientation of the Drosophila notum epithelium during flight muscle attachment to tendon cells. Here we show that halving the genetic dose of Rho kinase (Drok), the main activator of Myosin-II, enhances the epithelial deformation and bristle orientation defects associated with jbug/Filamin knockdown. Drok and activated Myo-II localize at the apical cell junctions, tendon processes and are associated to the myotendinous junction. Further, we found that Jbug/Filamin co-distribute at tendon cells with activated Myo-II. Finally, we found that Jbug/Filamin and Myo-II are in the same molecular complex and that the actin-binding domain of Jbug/Filamin is necessary for this interaction. These data together suggest that Jbug/Filamin and Myo-II proteins may act together in tendon cells to balance the tension generated during development of muscles-tendon interaction, maintaining the shape and polarity of the Drosophila notum epithelium.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been reported to inhibit the activity of Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET). TET modulates FOXP3 expression, while dysregulation of FOXP3 expression promotes the malignant progression of leukemia cells. We examined the role of TET-FOXP3 axis in the cytotoxic effects of ATO on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, U937. ATO-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was characterized by activation of caspase-3/-9, mitochondrial depolarization, and MCL1 downregulation. In addition, ATO-treated U937 cells showed ROS-mediated inhibition of TET2 transcription, leading to downregulation of FOXP3 expression and in turn, suppression of FOXP3-mediated activation of Lyn and Akt. Overexpression of FOXP3 or Lyn minimized the suppressive effect of ATO on Akt activation and MCL1 expression. Promoter luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the crucial role of Akt-mediated CREB phosphorylation in MCL1 transcription. Further, ATO-induced Akt inactivation promoted GSK3β-mediated degradation of MCL1. Transfection of constitutively active Akt expression abrogated ATO-induced MCL1 downregulation. MCL1 overexpression lessened the ATO-induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and increased the viability of ATO-treated cells. Thus, our data suggest that ATO induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells through its suppressive effect on TET2-FOXP3-Lyn-Akt axis-modulated MCL1 transcription and protein stabilization. Our findings also indicate that the same pathway underlies ATO-induced death in human leukemia HL-60 cells.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Accumulating research evidence suggests that individual dietary factors and dietary patterns might be implicated in the risk of development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This narrative review aims to present this evidence and provide nutritional recommendations for reducing RA risk in susceptible individuals. Overall, a 'Western' type diet rich in energy intake, total and saturated fat, an unbalanced ratio of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids, high in refined carbohydrates and sugar and low in fiber and antioxidants might increase the risk of RA both directly through increasing inflammation and indirectly through increasing insulin resistance and obesity, with the latter being a known risk factor for RA. On the contrary, consumption of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, derived from fish and fish oil, is associated with a reduced risk of RA probably due to their anti-inflammatory properties. The Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in plant-based foods such as wholegrains, legumes, fruit, vegetables, extra-virgin olive oil and low in red meat consumption, might have the potential to reduce the risk of RA. Based on current research evidence, it is suggested that adherence to the MD enhanced with an increased consumption of fatty fish, reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks and maintenance of a normal body weight, contributes to reducing the risk of RA. Further research on RA susceptibility will allow for more specific dietary recommendations to be made.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in men. The etiology of prostate cancer development and the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent progression remains to be further investigated. There are many known targets for prostate cancer therapy including the androgen receptor (AR) axis, but resistance eventually develops in advanced disease suggesting the need to better understand mechanisms of resistance and consideration of multi-targeted therapy. Mechanisms contributing to resistance may include gene amplifications, gene mutations, AR splice variants, and changes in expression of androgen receptor co-regulatory proteins. Given the limitations of approved therapies, further study of additional potential targets is warranted. This review focuses on the roles of autophagy pathway, p62, Yes-associated protein (YAP), cancer stem cells, and epigenetics. Therapies targeting these potential mechanisms of resistance may interact with currently approved therapies either additively or synergistically. Thus, the study of combination therapy against multiple targets may be critically important to achieve more impact against lethal forms of prostate cancer resistant to all approved current therapies.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), also known as classical mitogen-activated protein kinase, plays critical roles in cell regulation. ERK is activated through phosphorylation by a cascade of protein kinases including MEK. Various ligands activate the MEK/ERK pathway through receptor-dependent cell signaling. In cultured cells, many ligands such as growth factors, hormones, cytokines and vasoactive peptides elicit transient activation of MEK/ERK, often peaking at ~10\\u202fmin after the cell treatment. Here, we describe a novel biological event, in which ligand-mediated cell signaling results in the dephosphorylation of MEK/ERK. Neuromedin N and neurotensin, peptides derived from the same precursor polypeptide, elicit cell signaling through the neurotensin receptors. In cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), but not in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), we found that both neuromedin N and neurotensin promoted the dephosphorylation of ERK and MEK. Human PASMCs were found to express neurotensin receptor (NTR)-1, -2 and -3, while human PAECs only express NTR3. Neuromedin N-mediated dephosphorylation was suppressed by small chemical inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1/2A and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. Transmission electron microscopy showed the formation of endocytic vesicles in response to neuromedin N treatment, and dephosphorylation did not occur when sorting nexin 9, a critical regulator of the endocytic vesicle formation, was knocked down. We conclude that neuromedin N and neurotensin elicit a unique dephosphorylation signaling in the MEK/ERK pathway that is regulated by endocytosis. Considering the pathophysiological importance of the MEK/ERK pathway, this discovery of the dephosphorylation mechanism should advance the field of cell signaling.'\n",

We used BTBR T Itpr3/J (BTBR) mice, a model that demonstrates most of the core behavioral features of ASD, such as decreased sociability and high levels of repetitive behaviors. Currently, there is no treatment available that is able to improve most of the ASD disorder symptoms; thus, finding novel therapies is immediately required. Stat3 inhibitors are potential targets in the treatment of several immune disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of S3I-201, a selective Stat3 inhibitor, to determine its potential mechanism in BTBR mice. In this study, we first examined the effects of S3I-201 on repetitive behavior and marble burying. We also examined the treatment of S3I-201 on Th1 (IFN-γ and T-bet), Th17 (IL-17A, RORγt, Stat3, IL-21, and IL-22), and T regulatory (Treg, Foxp3 and Helios) production in spleen CD4 T cells. We further assessed Th1, Th17, and Treg mRNA and protein expression levels in brain tissues. S3I-201 treatment in BTBR mice significantly prevents marble burying and repetitive behavior. Furthermore, S3I-201 administration causes a considerable decrease in IFN-γ, T-bet, IL-17A, RORγt, Stat3, IL-21, and IL-22 levels, and increases in Foxp3 and Helios production CD4 T cells in BTBR mice. Additionally, S3I-201 treatment also significantly decreases Th1 and Th17 levels, and increases Treg mRNA and protein expression levels. Therefore, these results suggest that S3I-201 could be considered as a therapeutic option for ASD.'\n",

After adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, as IMAT area increased and density decreased from the first to fourth quartile, markers of inflammation increased linearly (p<0.01). Using linear regression, and with adjustment for demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and abdominal muscle area and density, a 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in total abdominal IMAT area was associated with a 21%, 36% and 20% higher IL-6, leptin, and CRP, respectively, and 19% lower adiponectin (p<0.001).

Our objective was to measure total CN levels in CF sputa by a simple and novel technique in P. aeruginosa positive and negative adult patients, to review respiratory tract (RT) mechanisms for the production and degradation of CN, and to interrogate sputa for post-translational protein modification by CN metabolites.\\n\\nMETHODS: Sputa CN concentrations were determined by using a commercially available CN electrode, measuring levels before and after addition of cobinamide, a compound with extremely high affinity for CN. Detection of protein carbamoylation was measured by Western blot.\\n\\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The commercial CN electrode was found to overestimate CN levels in CF sputum in a highly variable manner; cobinamide addition rectified this analytical issue. Although P. aeruginosa positive patients tended to have higher total CN values, no significant differences in CN levels were found between positive and negative sputa. The inflammatory oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was shown to rapidly decompose CN, forming cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and the carbamoylating species cyanate (NCO). Carbamoylated proteins were found in CF sputa, analogous to reported findings in asthma.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that CN is a transient species in the inflamed CF airway due to multiple biosynthetic and metabolic processes. Stable metabolites of CN, such as cyanate, or carbamoylated proteins, may be suitable biomarkers of overall CN production in CF airways.'\n",

In this paper, we report the first inhibitor-complexed crystal structure of SSB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 (PaSSB) at 2.68\\u202fÅ resolution (PDB entry 5YUN). The inhibitor, myricetin, is a flavonol that possesses many pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, and is beneficial for humans. Four monomers of PaSSB and two of myricetins were found per asymmetric unit. Various interactions between myricetin and PaSSB were examined. Among these, four residues in PaSSB, Lys7, Arg62, Glu80, and Gly107 were found crucial for forming hydrogen bond to myricetin. These two myricetins occupy the grooves for ssDNA-binding of SSB that may prevent ssDNA-wrapping and ssDNA-binding stably from SSB. In addition to explaining how SSB can be inhibited, the myricetin-SSB interaction modes in this paper may also provide insights into how myricetin can bind and inhibit proteins on cancer-signaling pathways.'\n",

While the neuromodulatory actions of NE have been well characterized, the response and involvement of cortical astrocytes to physiological noradrenergic systems remain largely unknown, especially at the molecular level. In this study, we biochemically characterize the action of NE on astrocytes of the murine neocortex. NE stimulation of acute brain slices rapidly increase phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) at Serine (Ser) 368, in slices from both juvenile and adolescent animals. The phosphorylation is mediated by the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway under the α1-adrenergic receptor and remains elevated for tens of minutes following brief exposure to NE, well after the intracellular calcium level returns to normal level, suggesting the plastic nature of this phosphorylation event. Importantly, this phosphorylation event persists in the absence of neuronal transmissions, suggesting that the effect of NE on Cx43 phosphorylation is induced directly on astrocytes. Furthermore, these NE-induced phosphorylations are associated with biochemical dissociation of Cx43 from gap-junctional plaques to non-junctional compartments. Finally, we show that pharmacological manipulation of the noradrenergic system using psychoactive drugs modulates phosphorylation of Cx43 in the cerebral cortex in\\xa0vivo. These data suggest that NE acts directly on astrocytes in parallel with neurons and modulates functionally critical connexin channel proteins in a plastic manner. Thus, plasticity of astrocytes induced by the \"gliomodulatory\" actions of NE may play important roles in their physiological as well as pharmacological actions in the brain.'\n",

The phosphoprotein (P) of CDV plays the important role in the virus replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we characterized four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated as Pc7, Pc8, Pc11 and Pc25 MAbs against the P protein of CDV-PS strain. A series of overlapping P protein-derived peptides representing the CDV-PS phosphoprotein (aa232-507) were screened to identify linear peptide epitopes recognized by each MAb. Finally, four epitopes, SHGMGIVAGSTN (E2-9), GPSVSAENVRQ (E6-2), INPELRPIIGR (E27-2) and TQSALKSTG (E4-9), are minimal linear epitopes recognized by the Pc7, Pc8, Pc11 and Pc25 MAbs, respectively. Each identified B-cell epitope was able to be recognized by CDV positive dog serum. Alignment analysis of the amino acid sequences indicated that the linear B-cell epitope of the Pc11 MAb is relatively conserved among different CDV strains, but the linear B-cell epitopes recognized by Pc7, Pc8 and Pc25 MAbs are not conserved among CDV strains. Our results revealed that the E27-2 peptide might be a common B-cell binding epitope of CDV antibodies.

A chronic alcohol exposure rat model (28 consecutive days of 20% alcohol intake and 6\\u2009h of withdrawal) was established. Here, we investigated the NMDAR1 (NR1), Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway in the modulation of anxiety-like behaviors in rats exposed to an open field and elevated plus maze (EPM) through systematic injections of memantine (a NMDAR inhibitor). We found that the NR1-CaMKII-ERK signaling pathway was activated after alcohol withdrawal in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) but not core (NAcC). Memantine treatment greatly ameliorated anxiety-like behavior in the rats experiencing alcohol withdrawal. Moreover, memantine uniformly suppressed the phosphorylation of NR1-CaMKII-ERK pathway induced by alcohol withdrawal. Our results suggest that activation of the NR1-CaMKII-ERK pathway in the mPFC and NAcSh is an important contributor to the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety behaviors. NMDAR signaling pathway inhibitors are thus potential therapeutics for treating alcohol abuse.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most cholesterol gallstones have a core consisting of inorganic and/or organic calcium salts, although the mechanisms of core formation are poorly understood. Here we examined whether the paracellular transport of ions at hepatic tight junctions is involved in the core formation of cholesterol gallstones, with particular interest in the role of phosphate ion, a common food additive and preservative.\\n\\nMETHODS: We focused on claudin-3 (Cldn3), a paracellular barrier-forming tight junction protein whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age. Since Cldn3-knockout mice show gallstone diseases, we used them to assess the causal relationship between paracellular phosphate ion transport and the core formation of cholesterol gallstones.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the liver of Cldn3-knockout mice, the paracellular phosphate ion transport through hepatic tight junctions was significantly increased, resulting in calcium phosphate core formation. Cholesterol overdose caused cholesterol gallstone disease in these mice.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We revealed that in the hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for phosphate ions, to help maintain biliary ion homeostasis. We provide in vivo evidence that elevated phosphate ion concentrations play a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks for cholesterol gallstone disease under cholesterol overdose.\\n\\nLAY SUMMARY: Tanaka et al. reveal a new mechanism for cholesterol-gallstone formation, in which increased paracellular phosphate ion transport across hepatobiliary epithelia causes calcium phosphate core formation and cholesterol gallstones. Thus, altered phosphate ion metabolism under cholesterol overdose plays a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks for cholesterol gallstone disease.'\n",

The extracellular matrix components, collagen type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), could contribute to intestinal fibrosis. We investigated whether children with inflammatory CD (B1) who later develop strictures (B2) have increased plasma levels of COL3A1 or COMP at diagnosis, compared to children who remain B1. We compared results to previously studied biomarkers, including autoantibodies against colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2).\\n\\nMETHODS: We selected 161 subjects (mean age, 12.2 years; 62% male) from the Risk Stratification and Identification of Immunogenic and Microbial Markers of Rapid Disease Progression in Children with Crohn's cohort, completed at 28 sites in the United States and Canada from 2008 through 2012. The children underwent colonoscopy and upper endoscopy at diagnosis and were followed every 6 months for 36 months; plasma samples were collected at baseline. Based on CD phenotype, children were separated to group 1 (B1 phenotype at diagnosis and follow up), group 2 (B2 phenotype at diagnosis), or group 3 (B1 phenotype at diagnosis who developed strictures during follow up). Plasma samples were collected from patients and 40 children without inflammatory bowel disease (controls) at baseline and analyzed by ELISA to measure COL3A1 and COMP. These results were compared with those from a previous biomarker study. Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise Dunn's tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare differences among groups.\\n\\nRESULTS: The median baseline concentration of COL3A1 was significantly higher in plasma from group 3 vs group 1 (P<.01) and controls (P=.01). Median baseline plasma concentrations of COMP did not differ significantly among groups. A model comprising baseline concentrations of COL3A1 and anti-CSF2 identified patients with B2 vs B1 CD with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71-0.89); the combined concentration identified patients with strictures with a sensitivity value of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.83) and a specificity value of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-0.93).\\n\\nCONCLUSION: We found median plasma concentrations of COL3A1, measured by ELISA at diagnosis, to be significantly higher in patients with CD who later developed strictures than in patients without strictures. The combination of concentrations of COL3A1 and anti-CSF2 might be used to identify pediatric patients at CD diagnosis who are at risk for future strictures.\"\n",

Imprinting genes have important roles in regulating foetal growth, programming and development. There, however, are limited data available on the effects of feed intake restriction on the expression of imprinting genes in pregnant goats. The present study, therefore, was conducted to assess the effects of maternal feed intake restriction on the relative abundance of mRNA for growth imprinting, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and epigenetic transcription-related genes in the liver and heart of foetal goats during gestation. A total of 24 Liuyang black goats (2.0±0.3\\u2009yr) with similar body weight (BW, 31.22±8.09\\u2009kg) and parity (2) were allocated equally to either a control group (CG) or a restriction group (RG) during both early (from 26 to 65 days) and late (from 96 to 135 days) gestation. All goats were fed a mixed diet and had free access to fresh water. The feed of the RG was 40% less than that of the CG. The early and late gestation goats were weighed, bled and slaughtered on days 65 and 135 of gestation, respectively. In early gestation, the foetal weight, body length, the weight of foetal heart and liver were greater (P\\u2009<\\u2009 0.05) in the RG. The CpG methylation of genomic DNA in the foetal heart was less (P\\u2009=\\u2009 0.0001) in the RG. The relative abundance of mRNA of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) genes in the foetal liver were greater (P\\u2009<\\u2009 0.05) in the RG. During the late gestation, the foetal weight, heart weight and liver weight were less (P\\u2009<\\u2009 0.05) in the RG. The relative abundance of mRNA for the MBD2 gene (P\\u2009=\\u2009 0.043) in the foetal heart, and the ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) gene (P\\u2009<\\u2009 0.05) in both the foetal heart and liver were greater in the RG.

Accessory sex glands were collected post-mortem from mature bulls (n = 3). Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed in tissue samples. Pre-ejaculate and sperm-rich fraction of seminal plasma from Angus (n = 42) and sperm-rich fraction from Holstein (n\\u2009=\\u200910) bulls were collected by electroejaculation. Holstein (n = 76) and Jersey (n = 14) bulls were collected by artificial vagina, and those with available sire conception rate scores were allocated to: (1) negative/0 (n = 15); or (2) positive (n = 45). Seminal plasma NGF concentrations were measured using ELISA. Relative abundance of NGF mRNA was greatest in the vesicular, intermediate in ampulla, and lowest in prostate and bulbourethral glands (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.03). The most intense NGF staining was detected in the ampulla and vesicular glands (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

      "Abstract :'The incidence of carcinomas highly increases with age. However, the initial steps of the age-related molecular carcinogenic processes remain poorly characterized. We previously showed that normal human epidermal keratinocytes spontaneously and systematically escape from senescence to give rise to preneoplastic emerging cells through a process called post-senescence neoplastic emergence (PSNE). To identify molecular pathways involved in the switch from senescence to pre-transformation, we performed Connectivity Map analyses and DAVID functional annotations followed by hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling of the gene expression signature of PSNE cells. We identified endoplasmic reticulum stress related pathways as key regulators of PSNE. Invalidation by RNA interference of the UPR sensors PERK, ATF6α, but not IRE1α, delayed the occurrence of senescence when performed in pre-senescent cells, and increased the PSNE frequency when performed in already senescent cells. Conversely, endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers applied to already senescent cells decreased the frequency of PSNE. In conclusion, these results indicate that the activation of the UPR could protect from the early carcinogenic steps by senescence evasion. This opens new avenues to explore therapeutics that could be useful in decreasing the age-associated tumor incidence.'\n",

ISG15 is not present in lower eukaryotes such as yeast, nematode (Caenorhabditis), or insect (Drosophila), indicating that the functions of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) are restricted to higher eukaryotes and have evolved with IFN signaling. Despite the highlighted complexity of ISG15 and ISGylation, increasing evidences have been emerging that ISG15 and ISGylation are implicated in a variety of pivotal cellular processes, involving protein translation, autophagy, exosome secretion, DNA repair, and immune modulation, which emphasizes the necessity of re-evaluation of ISG15 and ISGylation.

The innate immune response contributes to hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated wither STING regulates diet-induced in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and liver fibrosis in mice.\\n\\nMETHODS: Mice with disruption of Tmem173 (STING) on a C57BL/6J background, mice without disruption of this gene (controls), and mice with disruption of Tmem173 only in myeloid cells were fed a standard chow diet, a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat calories), or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD). Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow cells were isolated from mice, differentiated into macrophages, and incubated with DMXAA (an activator of STING) or cGAMP. Macrophages or their media were applied to mouse hepatocytes or human hepatic stellate cells (LX2) cells, which were analyzed for cytokine expression, protein phosphorylation, and fat deposition (oil red O staining following incubation with palmitate). We obtained liver tissues from patients with and without NAFLD and analyzed these by immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nRESULTS: Non-parenchymal cells of liver tissues from patients with NAFLD had higher levels of STING than liver tissues from patients without NAFLD. STING mice and mice with disruption only in myeloid cells developed less severe hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and/or fibrosis following a HFD or MCD than control mice. Levels of phosphorylated JNK and p65 and the mRNAs encoding TNF, IL1B, and IL6 (markers of inflammation) were significantly lower in liver tissues from STING mice vs control mice after a HFD or MCD. Transplantation of bone marrow cells from control mice to STING mice restored the severity of steatosis and inflammation following a HFD. Macrophages from control, but not STING mice, increased markers of inflammation in response to lipopolysaccharide and cGAMP. Hepatocytes and stellate cells co-cultured with STING macrophages in the presence of DMXAA, or incubated with the medium collected from these macrophages, had decreased fat deposition and markers of inflammation compared to hepatocytes incubated with control macrophages.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We found levels of STING to be increased in liver tissues from patients with NAFLD mice with HFD-induced steatosis. In mice, loss of STING from liver macrophages reduces the severity of fibrosis and the inflammatory response. STING might be a therapeutic target for NAFLD.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Cadmium, a neurotoxic environmental compound, produces cognitive disorders, although the mechanism remains unknown. Cadmium induces a more pronounced cell death on cholinergic neurons from basal forebrain (BF), mediated, in part, by increase in Aβ and total and phosphorylated Tau protein levels, which may explain cadmium effects on learning and memory processes. Cadmium downregulates the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) HSP 90, HSP70 and HSP27, and of HSF1, the master regulator of the HSP pathway. HSPs proteins reduce the production of Aβ and phosphorylated Tau proteins and avoid cell death pathways induction. Thus, we hypothesized that cadmium induced the production of Aβ and Tau proteins by HSP pathway disruption through HSF1 expression alteration, leading to BF cholinergic neurons cell death. Our results show that cadmium downregulates HSF1, leading to HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 gene expression downregulation in BF SN56 cholinergic neurons. In addition, cadmium induced Aβ and total and phosphorylated Tau proteins generation, mediated partially by HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 disruption, leading to cell death. These results provide new understanding of the mechanisms contributing to cadmium harmful effects on cholinergic neurons.'\n",

These findings can help to clarify the underlying mechanisms between the presence of systemic inflammatory reaction and prognosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between tumor immune microenvironment and CRP in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to explore the underlying mechanisms between CRP level and prognosis.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical measurement of CD4, CD8, CD163 (M2 macrophages), and Foxp3 (Regulatory T [Treg] cells) was performed in patients with clear-cell RCC (n\\xa0= 111) treated with radical or partial nephrectomy at our institution. The association between immunohistochemical status and preoperative serum CRP level and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was analyzed.\\n\\nRESULTS: Thirty-three patients (30%) had a high CRP level (≥ 5.0 mg/L), and the CSS rate was significantly worse among these patients than among the remaining patients (P\\xa0< .001).

Though peripheral blood cell count is widely used in benzene exposure assessment and health risk assessment, the reports regarding the effects of low-dose benzene exposure on blood cell count remain inconsistent. To uncover more sensitive biomarkers for low-dose benzene exposure, our previous study screened out three potential serum proteins-plasminogen (PLG), platelet basic protein (PBP) and apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100)-as biomarkers from chronic benzene poisoning patients by using proteomic analysis. In the present study, we verify the three serum proteins as biomarkers for the effects of low-dose benzene exposure in a large low-dose benzene exposure population. The study showed that serum PLG increased in benzene exposed workers and was positively correlated with benzene exposure levels. However, no significant changes in serum PBP or ApoB100 were found in the benzene exposed workers. To explore whether the candidate serum proteins are associated with hematotoxicity, the study population was regrouped into two groups, based on their WBC counts. Our results showed that the workers with high serum PLG levels suffered higher risk of WBC abnormalities than did workers with low serum PLG levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that the increase in serum PLG might be associated with low-dose benzene exposure and benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Thus, we suggest serum PLG could be used as a potential biomarker for the effects of low-dose benzene exposure.'\n",

However, par-1 mutations do not cause failure to restrict the anterior PAR polarity complex to the same extent as mutations in the posteriorly localized PAR-2 protein. Further, it has been difficult to examine the role of PAR-1 in subsequent divisions due to the early defects in par-1 mutant embryos. Here we show that the PIG-1 kinase acts redundantly with PAR-1 to restrict the anterior PAR-3 protein for normal polarity in the one-cell embryo. By using a temperature sensitive allele of par-1, that exhibits enhanced lethality when combined with a pig-1 mutation, we have further explored roles for these genes in subsequent divisions. We find that both PIG-1 and PAR-1 regulate spindle orientation in the EMS blastomere of the four-cell stage embryo to ensure that it undergoes an asymmetric division. In this cell, PIG-1 and PAR-1 act in parallel pathways for spindle positioning, PIG-1 in the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway and PAR-1 in the Wnt pathway.'\n",

Highly specific endonucleases induce a DNA double strand break near the mutant site, which is subsequently repaired by cellular DNA repair mechanisms that involve the presence of a wild type template DNA. In vivo applications of this strategy are still rare, in part due to the absence of appropriate animal models carrying human disease mutations and knowledge of the efficient targeting of endonucleases. Here we report the generation and characterization of a new mouse model for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) carrying a point mutation in the mutational hotspot exon ORF15 of the RPGR gene as well as a recognition site for the homing endonuclease I-SceI.

Optical coherence tomography studies revealed a slowly progressive retinal degeneration with photoreceptor loss starting at 9 months of age, paralleling the onset of functional deficits as seen in the electroretinogram. Early changes to the outer retinal bands can be used as biomarker during treatment applications.

One PTM is the cyclic removal and ligation of the C-terminal tyrosine of α-tubulin. This has been implicated in cellular processes such as mitosis, cardiomyocyte contraction, and neuronal function. Recently, vasohibins (VASHs) were identified as the first tubulin-detyrosinating enzymes, A cell-autonomous role for VASHs in regulating the cytoskeleton was unexpected due to their previous association with angiogenesis.

      "Abstract :'Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) treatment is an effective strategy for the functional repair of central nervous system (CNS) insults through the production of bioactive molecules. We have previously demonstrated that the interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by MSCs plays an anti-apoptotic role in injured astrocytes and partly promotes functional recovery in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). However, the mechanisms of IL-6 underlying the proliferation of injured astrocytes have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of MSCs on astrocyte proliferation in neonatal rats subjected to HIBD. A HIBD model was established in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, and MSCs were administered by intracerebroventricular injection 5\\u202fdays after HIBD. Rat primary astrocytes were cultured, subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury and then immediately co-cultured with MSCs in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining, Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8, flow cytometry, Ca imaging, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were performed. We found that MSCs transplantation not only promoted the recovery of learning and memory function in HIBD rats but also significantly reduced the number of Ki67/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) cells in the hippocampi 7-14\\u202fdays after HIBD. In addition to increasing IL-6 expression in both the hippocampi of HIBD rats and astrocyte culture medium, MSCs treatment in vitro significantly increased the expression levels of glycoprotein (gp) 130 and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase α (p-AMPKα) and decreased the expression levels of p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets. Furthermore, MSCs treatment induced a protein-protein interaction between gp130 and p-AMPKα. Suppression of IL-6 expression in MSCs reversed the above regulatory functions of MSCs in hippocampal astrocytes. The utilization of rapamycin further confirmed that mTOR participated in the proliferation of reactive astrocytes. These findings suggest that endogenous IL-6 produced by MSCs in the HIBD microenvironment provides therapeutic advantages by activating AMPK/mTOR signaling, thus reducing the proliferation of reactive astrocytes.'\n"

Based on our results, we postulate that an intensification of the kynurenine pathway occurs as a consequence of nerve injury. The G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) is important for kynurenine pathway activation. Cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors have also been shown to have beneficial effects on neuropathic pain. Therefore, the aims of our research were to elucidate how a substance that acts as both an agonist of GPR35 and an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase influences neuropathic pain in a rat model. Here, we demonstrated that preemptive and repeated intrathecal (i.t.) administration (16\\u202fh and 1\\u202fh before injury and then after nerve ligation daily for 7 days) of zaprinast (1\\u202fμg/5\\u202fμl) significantly attenuated mechanical (von Frey test) and thermal (cold plate test) hypersensitivity measured on day 7 after chronic constriction injury, and the effect of even a single injection lasted up to 24\\u202fh. Our data indicate that zaprinast diminished the number of IBA1-positive cells and consequently attenuated the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, and NOS2 in the lumbar spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglia. Our results also demonstrated that zaprinast potentiated the analgesic properties of morphine and buprenorphine. In summary, in a neuropathic pain model, zaprinast significantly reduced pain symptoms and enhanced the effectiveness of opioids. Our data provide new evidence that modulation of both GPR35 and phosphodiesterase could be an important strategy for innovative pharmacological treatments designed to decrease hypersensitivity evoked by nerve injury.'\n",

      "Abstract :'INTRODUCTION: We have previously shown that even a single course of antenatal betamethasone (BET) as an inductor for lung maturity reduces birth weight and head circumference. Moreover, animal studies link BET administration to alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gland-axis (HPA). The unhindered development of the fetal HPA axis is dependent on the function and activity of 11β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), a transplacental cortisol barrier. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BET on this transplacental barrier and fetal growth.\\n\\nMETHODS: Pregnant women treated with a single course of BET between 23\\xa0+\\xa05 to 34\\xa0+\\xa00 weeks of gestation were compared to gestational-age-matched controls. Placental size and neonatal anthropometrics were taken. Cortisol and ACTH levels were measured in maternal and umbilical cord blood samples. Placental 11β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) protein levels and 11β-HSD2 protein and activity levels were determined. Parameters were analyzed independent of sex, and in subgroups divided by gender and gestational age.\\n\\nRESULTS: In term born females, BET administration was associated with reduced head circumference and decreased 11β-HSD2 protein levels and enzyme activity. Males treated with BET, especially those born prematurely, showed increased 11β-HSD2 protein levels.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: A single course of BET alters placental glucocorticoid metabolism in a sex-specific manner. Decreased 11β-HSD2 levels in term born females may lead to an increased placental transfer of maternal cortisol and therefore result in a reduced head circumference and a higher risk for altered stress response in adulthood. Further research is needed to conclude the significance of increased 11β-HSD2 levels in males.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The presence of different APOE isoforms represents a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Besides the pleiotropic effects of APOE polymorphism on heart and neurological diseases, this review summarizes the less-known functions of APOE and the possible implications for cardiovascular disorders. Beyond the role as lipid transporting protein, its involvement in lipid membrane homeostasis and signaling, as well as its nuclear transcriptional effects suggests a more complex role of APOE, receiving great interest from researchers and physicians from all medical fields. Due to the presence of different APOE isoforms in human population, understanding APOE's role in pathological processes represents not only a challenge, but a demand for further development of therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases.\"\n",

Recent advances demonstrate that these proteins can also be employed as molecular recognition units in gas-phase biosensors. In addition, the interactions between odorant molecules and ORs or OBPs are a source of inspiration for designing peptides with tunable odorant selectivity. We review recent progress in gas biosensors employing biological units (ORs, OBPs, and peptides) in light of future developments in artificial olfaction, emphasizing examples where biological components have been employed to detect gas-phase analytes.\"\n",

Mast cell tumours (MCTs) are associated with mutations of c-kit, a proto-oncogene encoding the Kit protein. In this study, we examined SCF expression in 23 samples of feline MCTs. SCF expression was detected in 10 cutaneous MCTs and a case of splenic mastocytosis. In the cutaneous MCTs, SCF-positive tumour cells were located at the margins. Kit was expressed in eight of the 10 cutaneous cases of SCF-expressing MCTs. In these cases, Kit-positive cells were located near to SCF-positive cells, and SCF/Kit double-positive tumour cells were found. Ki67-positive tumour cells were not found near to SCF-positive cells. These results suggest that SCF autocrine/paracrine mechanisms are involved in the expansion of cutaneous MCTs, but not in tumour proliferation.'\n",

The effect of recombinant GDF11 on the growth of esophageal cancer cells was measured by CCK6 method. In order to investigate the effect of recombinant GDF11 on the proliferation and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells, the expression of apoptosis-promoting protein Bax and proliferative-associated protein Bcl-2 in esophageal cancer cells were determined using western blot.

      "Abstract :'Apelin, which is a new hormone, is secreted especially in the brain by hypothalamus as well as by many other organs like the stomach, fat tissue, and the heart. For apelin, whose possible effects on many bodily functions like the endocrine system, cardiovascular system and metabolic activities are still under investigation, the reproductive system is also an important target area. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of plasma apelin levels in rats that were in diestrus, pregnancy and lactation periods, and to examine its possible effects on myometrium contractions of pregnant rats and non-pregnant rats that were in diestrus period.\\xa0 The plasma apelin concentrations in female adult Wistar rats were determined with the ELISA method in the diestrus period, and on the 12th, 18th, and 21st days of the pregnancy, and on the 2nd and 10th days of lactation (n=7 for each group). In addition, the effect of apelin at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM doses on isometric contractions in the rat uterus on the 21st day of pregnancy and in diestrus period was tested by using isolated organ bath. This protocol was repeated under conditions that were pre-treated with protein kinase C inhibitor in calcium-free medium, and the possible effect of apelin on contractions and the mechanisms that might mediate this effect were investigated. When plasma apelin levels were compared with the rats in diestrus period, the apelin concentrations in the 21-day pregnancy group were high at a significant level (p&lt;0.05); and low at a significant level in the 2-day lactation group (p&lt;0.05). In myometrium contraction trials, it was observed that apelin induced the contractions. Apelin increased the frequency of the myometrium contractions at a significant level when applied at 1 μM and 10 μM concentrations (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001). Only after the apelin application at 10 μM concentration did the amplitude of the contractions increase at a significant level (p&lt;0.01). In the myometrium of the rats that were on the 21st day of pregnancy, the frequency of the contractions was statistically significant at 0.1 μM, 1 μM and 10 μM doses (p&lt;0.01). In addition, the amplitude of the contractions increased at a statistically significant level at 1 μM and 10 μM dose application (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01, respectively). The apelin application induced the contractions in calcium-free medium. When apelin was applied after the pre-application with protein kinase C inhibitor, no contractions were observed. The present study showed that apelin levels were increased at the end of pregnancy in rats, and the hormone induced the uterus contractions. This effect does not occur with protein kinase C inhibitor and in calcium-free medium, which shows that protein kinase C pathway might play a role in these mechanism.\\xa0 These findings show that apelin might be an endogenous peptide that plays a role on uterine contractions at birth in rats.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Transcription factor proto-oncogene TWIST1 and tumor metastasis suppressor gene LASS2 have been reported to be involved in various carcinomas but their expression profiles and prognostic significances in bladder cancer are largely unknown. We aimed to determine these genes' expression levels both at mRNA and protein level in bladder cancer. mRNA expression levels of TWIST1 and LASS2 genes were examined using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in human bladder tumors and paired normal adjacent tissues obtained from 44 patients. Protein expression profiles of both genes were detected by immunohistochemical staining in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from the same patients. The expression profiles of TWIST1 mRNA in bladder tumors were significantly lower than the normal adjacent tissues and linked to both the stage and the grade. The expression profiles of LASS2 mRNA in bladder tumors were also significantly lower than the normal adjacent tissues reflecting the potential tumor suppressor profile of the gene, independently from stage or grade. By immunohistochemistry, TWIST1 and LASS2 positive expression rates were found as 14.3% (6/42) and 38.1% (16/42), respectively. As potential molecular markers for bladder carcinoma, both TWIST1 and LASS2 transcripts seem to play role during the tumorigenesis and development of bladder cancer. Lack of a functional link and/or weak inverse link between TWIST1 and LASS2 transcripts and immunohistochemical findings may reflect the potential associations of transcription regulation mechanisms and merit further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the combined expression profile of TWIST1 and LASS2 in bladder cancer both at mRNA and protein level.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in melanoma. Although miR-637 has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor in several cancers, its function in melanoma and the molecular mechanism behind that function remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-637 in human melanoma and explored its relevant mechanisms. We found that the expression of miR-637 is significantly downregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. While overexpression of miR-637 inhibited melanoma cell proliferation and cell cycle G1-S transition, and induced apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-637 promoted cell proliferation and G1-S transition, and suppressed apoptosis. Subsequent investigation revealed that miR-637 expression was inversely correlated with P-REX2a expression in melanoma tissues. P-REX2a was determined to be a direct target of miR-637 by using a luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-637 decreased P-REX2a expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and suppression of miR-637 increased P-REX2a expression. Importantly, silencing P-REX2a recapitulated the cellular and molecular effects seen upon miR-637 overexpression, whereas, overexpression of P-REX2a eliminated the effects of miR-637 overexpression on melanoma cells. Furthermore, both enforced expression of miR-637 or silencing of P-REX2a resulted in activation of PTEN, leading to a decline in AKT phosphorylation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that miR-637 inhibites melanoma cell proliferation by activation of AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression via targeting P-REX2a. These findings suggest that miR-637 plays a crucial role in melanoma progression, and may serve as a potential novel target for melanoma therapy.'\n"

To establish a unilateral cochlear damage model, the unilateral cochlea was destroyed. The control group consisted of 50 kHz and 83 kHz bone conduction ultrasounds in unaltered guinea pigs. In each group, cerebral blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effects were determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The cochlear outer hair cell motor protein, Prestin, and the microfilament protein, F-Actin, were detected. We found that bone conduction ultrasound irradiation at 50 kHz and 83 kHz on the guinea pig inner ear for six hours leads to hair cell damage. Furthermore, low frequency bone conduction ultrasound induces major damage to outer hair cells, while high frequency ultrasound damages both internal and external hair cells. fMRI analysis of cerebral BLOD effects revealed an affected cerebral cortex region of interest (ROI) of 4 and 2, respectively, for the normal control group at 50 kHz or 83 kHz, and 2 for the 83 kHz bone conduction ultrasound cochlear injury group, while 50 kHz bone conduction ultrasound failed to induce the cortical ROI within injury model. Results reveal that the spatial location of guinea pig cochlear hair cells determines coding function for lower ultrasound frequencies, and high frequency bone conduction ultrasound may affect the cochlear spiral ganglion or cranial nerve nucleus in bone conduction ultrasound periphery perception.'\n",

We previously showed that the Fanconi anemia C protein (FANCC) interacts with UNC5A and delays UNC5A-mediated apoptosis. FANCC is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that has multiple functions including DNA damage signaling, oxygen radical metabolism, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. Given the direct interaction between FANCC and UNC5A and that FANCC interferes with UNC5A-mediated apoptosis, we explored the possibility that FANCC might play a role in axonal-like growth processes.\\n\\nRESULTS: Here we show that FANCC and UNC5A are localized to regions of neurite outgrowth during neuronal cell differentiation. We also show that absence of FANCC is required for neurite outgrowth. In addition, FANCC seems required for UNC5A expression. Results from this study combined with our previous report suggest that FANCC plays a role in tissue development through the regulation of UNC5A-mediated functions.'\n",

In this study, we have cloned, over-expressed an Escherichia coli gene encoding a sperm immobilizing factor (SIF) that inhibits sperm motility for the development of vaginal contraceptive from a biological source i.e. E. coli. The contraceptive efficacy of the Escherichia coli recombinant sperm immobilizing factor (r-SIF) was also determined.\\n\\nMETHODS: Genomic DNA library of an E. coli strain isolated from semen sample of an infertile male was constructed for the identification and cloning of E. coli SIF coding gene.

      "Abstract :'During decidualization, endometrial stromal cells differentiate into a secretory phenotype to modulate the uterine microenvironment and promote embryo implantation. This highly metabolic process relies on ovarian steroid receptors and glucose transporters. Canonical Notch signaling is mediated by the transcription factor Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J Region (RBPJ). Loss of RBPJ in the mouse uterus ( PgrRbpj; Rbpj c-KO) results in subfertility in part due to an abnormal uterine-embryonic axis during implantation and, as described herein, decidualization failure. Induced in vivo decidualization in Rbpj c-KO mice was impaired with the downregulation of decidual markers and decreased progesterone receptor (Pgr) signaling. Consistent with in vivo mouse data, RBPJ knockdown during in vitro Human uterine fibroblast (HuF) cell decidualization results in the reduced expression of decidual marker genes along with PGR. Expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, was decreased in the RBPJ-silenced HuF cells, which corresponded to decreased Slc2a1 in the secondary decidual zone of Rbpj c-KO mouse uteri. Exogenous administration of pyruvate, which bypasses the need for glucose, rescues PRL expression in RBPJ-deficient HuF cells. In summary, Notch signaling through RBPJ controls both ovarian steroid receptor PGR and glucose transporter SLC2A1 expression during decidualization, and this dysregulation likely contributes to embryo implantation failure.'\n",

Cultured adult human retinal pigment epithelial cells showed dendritiform morphology during the early days of encapsulation with fibrin glue. Moreover, an increasing inhibitory effect on cell growth was observed with increasing concentrations of fibrin glue. At the transcriptional level, the expression of MMP2, PAX6, and ITGB1 in FG1-encapsulated cells was significantly higher than that in other treated groups; however, the expression of ACTA2 was lower in all fibrin glue-encapsulated groups compared to that in the controls.

We revealed that histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) was induced following Hmox1 induction under 1% oxygen treatment and this induction was attenuated after the treatment of siRNA against Hmox1. Interestingly, this HDAC2 induction was dependent on Hmox1 protein as well as its enzymatic activity, and was regulated by carbon monoxide released from heme degradation. Furthermore, histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, successfully abrogated the inhibitory effects of vascular smooth muscle migration and proliferation by Hmox1 induction in vitro. In a rat carotid balloon injury model, similar results were observed by measuring neointimal thickening. As such, we concluded that Hmox1 inhibits neointimal hyperplasia via HDAC2 in rats.'\n",

They were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups and fed orally for 8 weeks; saline alone, ramipril (2.5 mg/30g/d), or carvedilol (3.125 mg/30g/d), respectively. Aortic diameter (AD) was measured by micro-computed tomography, and the level of biomarkers of aortic tissue such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was evaluated. After treatment, AD of both ramipril and carvedilol group was smaller than in the saline group. The percentage change of AD in both ramipril and carvedilol groups was significantly smaller than that of the saline group. Pathologic examination revealed relatively well-preserved aortic walls in the ramipril group compared to the carvedilol and saline groups. The level of MCP-1 was markedly decreased in both the ramipril and carvedilol groups compared to the saline group.

      "Abstract :'Bicontinuous nanospheres (BCNs) are polymeric analogs to lipid cubosomes, possessing cubic liquid crystalline phases with high internal surface area, aqueous channels for loading hydrophilic molecules, and high hydrophobic volume for lipophilic payloads. Primarily due to difficulties in scalable and consistent fabrication, neither controlled delivery of payloads via BCNs nor their organ or cellular biodistributions following in vivo administration have been demonstrated or characterized. We have recently validated flash nanoprecipitation as a rapid method of assembling uniform monodisperse 200-300 nm diameter BCNs from poly(ethylene glycol) -b-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG -b-PPS) co-polymers. Here, we compare these BCNs both in vitro and in vivo to 100 nm PEG -b-PPS polymersomes (PSs), which have been well characterized as nanocarriers for controlled delivery applications. Using a small molecule fluorophore and a fluorescently tagged protein as respective lipophilic and water-soluble model cargos, we demonstrate that BCNs can achieve significantly higher encapsulation efficiencies for both payloads on a per unit mass basis. At time points of 4 and 24 h after intravenous administration to mice, we found significant differences in organ-level uptake between BCNs and PSs, with BCNs showing reduced accumulation in the liver and increased uptake in the spleen. Despite these organ-level differences, BCNs and PSs displayed strikingly similar uptake profiles by immune cell populations in vitro and in the liver, spleen, and blood, as assayed by flow cytometry. In conclusion, we have found PEG -b-PPS BCNs to be well suited for dual loading and delivery of molecular payloads, with a favorable organ biodistribution and high cell uptake by therapeutically relevant immune cell populations.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Heme ligation in hemoglobin is typically assumed by the \"proximal\" histidine. Hydrophobic contacts, ionic interactions, and the ligation bond secure the heme between two α-helices denoted E and F. Across the hemoglobin superfamily, several proteins also use a \"distal\" histidine, making the native state a bis-histidine complex. The group 1 truncated hemoglobin from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, GlbN, is one such bis-histidine protein. Ferric GlbN, in which the distal histidine (His46 or E10) has been replaced with a leucine, though expected to bind a water molecule and yield a high-spin iron complex at neutral pH, has low-spin spectral properties. Here, we applied nuclear magnetic resonance and electronic absorption spectroscopic methods to GlbN modified with heme and amino acid replacements to identify the distal ligand in H46L GlbN. We found that His117, a residue located in the C-terminal portion of the protein and on the proximal side of the heme, is responsible for the formation of an alternative bis-histidine complex. Simultaneous coordination by His70 and His117 situates the heme in a binding site different from the canonical site. This new holoprotein form is achieved with only local conformational changes. Heme affinity in the alternative site is weaker than in the normal site, likely because of strained coordination and a reduced number of specific heme-protein interactions. The observation of an unconventional heme binding site has important implications for the interpretation of mutagenesis results and globin homology modeling.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Purpose: In the present study, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) with tumor-tropic behavior were used as drug delivery vehicle to selectively target melanoma. A human neural stem cell line (HB1.F3) was transduced into two types: one expressed only the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene (HB1.F3.CD) and the other expressed both CD and human interferon-β (IFN-β) genes (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β).\\n\\nMaterials and Methods: This study verified the tumor-tropic migratory competence of engineered hNSCs on melanoma (A375SM) using a modified Boyden chamber assay in vitro and CM-DiI staining in vivo. The antitumor effect of HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β on melanoma was also confirmed using an MTT assay in vitro and xenograft mouse models.\\n\\nResults: A secreted form of interferon-β from the HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells modified the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and metastasis of melanoma. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment also accelerated the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX and decelerated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL on melanoma cell line.\\n\\nConclusion: Our results illustrate that engineered hNSCs prevented malignant melanoma cells from proliferating in the presence of the prodrug, and the form that secreted interferon-β intervened in the EMT process and melanoma metastasis. Hence, neural stem cell-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy is a plausible treatment for malignant melanoma.'\n",

Additionally, these studies have been limited by heterogeneity and sample size.\\n\\nMETHODS: We analyzed the blood loss patterns of 617 consecutive adult patients undergoing lumbar and/or thoracic fusions requiring subfascial drain placement at a single institution from January 2009 to December 2016. Patients were divided into BMP and non-BMP cohorts, and a propensity score analysis was conducted to account for the differences between cohorts.\\n\\nRESULTS: At a per-level fused basis, the BMP group exhibited a significant reduction in the intraoperative (66.1 mL per-level fused basis; 95% confidence interval [CI], 127.9 to 4.25 mL; p =0.036) and total perioperative blood loss (100.7 mL per-level fused basis; 95% CI, 200.9 to 0.5 mL; p =0.049). However, no significant differences were observed in an analysis when not controlling for the number of levels or when examining the postoperative drain output.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: RhBMP-2 appears to reduce both intraoperative and total blood loss during lumbar and thoracic fusions on a per-level fused basis. This total reduction in blood loss was achieved via intraoperative effects because RhBMP-2 had no significant effect on the postoperative drain output.'\n",

No study has compared the efficacy of MIS-posterolateral fusion (MIS-PLF), MIS-transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF), and midline lumbar fusion (MIDLF) with modified cortical bone trajectory screws for lumbar spondylolisthesis.\\n\\nMETHODS: Fifty-nine patients with single-level lumbar spondylolisthesis and a minimum follow-up period of 1 year were included in this study. The MIS-PLF, MIS-TLIF, and MIDLF groups included 22, 15, and 22 patients, respectively. The average age of the groups was 70.6, 49.3, and 62.7 years, respectively. The evaluation parameters were operation time, intraoperative bleeding, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) value, creatine kinase (CK) value, and overall functional outcome as per the Japanese Orthopedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) score. The changes in the lumbar lordosis angle (LLA), segmental disc angle (SDA), and disc height were measured. Fusion rate, screw loosening, and loss of correction were also assessed.\\n\\nRESULTS: MIDLF showed a significantly shorter operation time (111 min), less bleeding amount (112.5 mL), and lower values of CRP and CK than the other two techniques. There was no significant difference in the JOABPEQ scores of the three groups. MIDLF resulted in a greater increase in the LLA and SDA postoperatively. MIDLF and MIS-TLIF resulted in a significant increase in the middle disc height compared with MIS-PLF. MIDLF showed a lower loss of correction after 6 months postoperatively (2.6%) than MIS-PLF (5.2%) and MIS-TLIF (4.2%). The fusion rate was 100% in the MIDLF and MIS-TLIF groups and 90% in the MIS-PLF group. Screw loosening occurred in 10% of the MIS-PLF cases, 7.14% of the MIS-TLIF cases, and 4.76% of the MIDLF cases.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: MIDLF was the least invasive, and there was no significant difference between the three groups in terms of fusion, screw loosening, and clinical outcomes.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The current number of drugs available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly limited and their benefit for therapy is given only in the early state of the disease. An effective therapy should affect those processes which mainly contribute to the neuronal decay. There have been many approaches for a reduction of toxic Aβ peptides which mostly failed to halt cognitive deterioration in patients. The formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and its precursor tau oligomers have been suggested as main cause of neuronal degeneration because of a direct correlation of their density to the degree of dementia. Reducing of tau aggregation may be a viable approach for the treatment of AD. NFT consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and tau hyperphosphorylation reduces microtubule binding. Several protein kinases are discussed to be involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. We developed novel inhibitors of three protein kinases (gsk-3β, cdk5, and cdk1) and discussed their activity in relation to tau phosphorylation and on tau⁻tau interaction as a nucleation stage of a tau aggregation in cells. Strongest effects were observed for those inhibitors with effects on all the three kinases with emphasis on gsk-3β in nanomolar ranges.\"\n",

Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were administered water, Captopril (50 mg/kg) or Hpp11 at different doses (25, 55 and 85 mg/kg), and the systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded. The SBP of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats administered water or Hpp11 was also recorded. Additionally, plasmatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was determined in the SHR administered Hpp11. Moreover, the relaxation caused by Hpp11 in isolated aortic rings from Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated. Hpp11 exhibited antihypertensive activity at doses of 55 and 85 mg/kg, with maximum activity 6 h post-administration. At this time, no differences were found between these doses and Captopril. Initial SBP values of 55 and 85 mg/kg were recovered 24 or 8 h post-administration, respectively, 55 mg/kg being the most effective dose. At this dose, a reduction in the plasmatic ACE activity in the SHR was found. However, Hpp11 did not relax the aortic ring preparations. Therefore, ACE inhibition could be the mechanism underlying Hpp11 antihypertensive effect. Remarkably, Hpp11 did not modify SBP in WKY rats, showing that the decreased SBP effect is specific to the hypertensive state.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"As an important second messenger, the calcium ion (Ca) plays a vital role in normal brain function and in the pathophysiological process of different neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy. Ca takes part in the regulation of neuronal excitability, and the imbalance of intracellular Ca is a trigger factor for the occurrence of epilepsy. Several anti-epileptic drugs target voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). Intracellular Ca levels are mainly controlled by VDCCs located in the plasma membrane, the calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) inside the cytoplasm, calcium channels located on the intracellular calcium store (particular the endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the Ca-pumps located in the plasma membrane and intracellular calcium store. So far, while many studies have established the relationship between calcium control factors and epilepsy, the mechanism of various Ca regulatory factors in epileptogenesis is still unknown. In this paper, we reviewed the function, distribution, and alteration of VDCCs and CBPs in the central nervous system in the pathological process of epilepsy. The interaction of VDCCs with CBPs in the pathological process of epilepsy was also summarized. We hope this review can provide some clues for better understanding the mechanism of epileptogenesis, and for the development of new anti-epileptic drugs targeting on VDCCs and CBPs.\"\n",

The stability of the candidate genes was evaluated with geNorm and NormFinder under three different experimental conditions, and several genes with excellent stability were selected.

Results from the three experimental conditions revealed that ACT1 and INTF7 were the most prominent genes in , CYC3 was the most stable gene in different development stages, INTF4/AEF3 were the top-ranked genes across carbon sources, while INTF3/CYC3 pair showed the robust stability for temperature stress treatment. We suggest using ACT1, AEF3, CYC3, INTF3, INTF4 and INTF7 as reference genes for gene expression analysis studies for any of the 10  strains tested in this study. The stability and practicality of the gene, vacuolar protein sorting (INTF3), vacuolar ATP synthase (INTF4) and14-3-3 protein (INTF7) involving the basic biological processes were validated for the first time as the candidate reference genes for quantitative PCR.

Sk-MSCs were isolated from green fluorescence protein transgenic mice and then expanded and transplanted with PGA felt for the hybrid transplantation (HY group) into the RLN transected mouse model. Transplantation of culture medium (M group) and PGA + medium (PGA group) were examined as controls. After eight weeks, trans-oral video laryngoscopy demonstrated 80% recovery of spontaneous vocal-fold movement during breathing in the HY group, whereas the M and PGA groups showed wholly no recoveries. The Sk-MSCs showed active engraftment confined to the damaged RLN portion, representing favorable prevention of cell diffusion on PGA, with an enhanced expression of nerve growth factor mRNAs. Axonal re-connection in the HY group was confirmed by histological serial sections. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the differentiation of Sk-MSCs into Schwann cells and perineurial/endoneurial cells and axonal growth supportive of perineurium/endoneurium. The number of axons recovered was over 86%. These results showed that the stem cell and cytokine delivery system using hybrid transplantation of Sk-MSCs/PGA-felt is a potentially practical and useful approach for the recovery of transected RLN.'\n",

A sizeable number of proteomic studies have used the combination of large-scale separation techniques, such as high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or liquid chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry, for high-throughput protein identification. These studies have applied proteomics to comprehensive biochemical profiling and comparison studies while using different tissues and biological fluids from patients to demonstrate the physiological or pathological adaptations within their proteomes. Further investigations into these proteome-wide alterations will enable us to not only understand the disease pathophysiology, but also to determine signature proteins that can serve as biomarkers for obesity and related diseases.

The non-structural V protein of NDV plays an important role in antagonizing innate host defenses to facilitate viral replication. However, there is a lack of knowledge related to the mechanisms through which the V protein regulates viral replication. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in the host is involved in a variety of functions and is activated by several stimuli, including viral replication. In this study, we show that both the lentogenic strain, La Sota, and the velogenic strain, F48E9, of NDV activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling pathway. The pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation using the highly selective inhibitors U0126 and SCH772984 resulted in the reduced levels of NDV RNA in cells and virus titers in the cell supernatant, which established an important role for the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in NDV replication. Moreover, the overexpression of the V protein in HeLa cells increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and induced the transcriptional changes in the genes downstream of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the V protein is involved in the ERK signaling pathway-mediated promotion of NDV replication and thus, can be investigated as a potential antiviral target.'\n",

Adult NOD mice from the F0 generation and all subsequent generations (F1 to F4) were fed either A1 or A2 beta-casein supplemented diets.

The microstructure, crystallinity, functional groups, mechanical, degradation and thermal property of the prepared SF with HSPI/U/F copolymer resin have been studied, and the degradation mechanism was also elucidated. XRD results showed that the bond breakage between SF and HSPI/U/F copolymer resin induced a decrease in relative degradation-resistant crystal structures. FTIR spectra showed that the methylolated HSPI units could form a cross-linking network with U/F and SF. The BFP degradation after soil burial was mainly attributed to the effects of microorganisms. The degradation products were environmentally friendly, because they were degradable and could fertilize the soil. In addition, the U/F adhesives were slightly degraded by the microorganisms due to the HSPI in the pots. The TG and DSC results showed that the molecular motion of the BFP matrix could be restricted by the degradation action and the content of HSPI, resulting in decreased crystallization enthalpy and showing good thermal property. The tensile strength of different reinforced samples was not significantly reduced in comparison to U/F resin, and still kept good mechanical performance. Thus, the prepared SF reinforced HSPI/U/F copolymer resins could have good potential for use in the field of biodegradable flower pots because of their good thermal property, mechanical property, biodegradability, and relatively low cost.'\n",

Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity are elevated in apical periodontitis and have been suggested to participate in bone resorption. Therefore, inhibiting MMP-2 activation may be considered a therapeutic strategy for treating apical periodontitis. Resveratrol is a natural non-flavonoid polyphenol that has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the capacity of resveratrol to protect osteoblast cells from  LPS insults and the mechanism of its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 activation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that cell viability is unchanged when 10 mg L LPS is used, and MMP-2 expression is drastically induced by  LPS in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Twenty micromolar resveratrol did not reduce MC3T3-E1 cell viability. Resveratrol increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, and Compound , a specific AMPK inhibitor, partially abolished the resveratrol-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK. In addition, AMPK inhibition blocked the effects of resveratrol on MMP-2 expression and activity in LPS-induced MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment with resveratrol also induced suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. SOCS1 siRNA negated the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on LPS-induced MMP-2 production. Additionally, resveratrol-induced SOCS1 upregulation was reduced by treatment with compound . These results demonstrate that AMPK and SOCS1 activation are important signaling events during resveratrol-mediated inhibition of MMP-2 production in response to LPS in MC3T3-E1 cells, and there is crosstalk between AMPK and SOCS1 signaling.'\n",

RNA sequencing revealed 2547 differentially regulated transcripts in MCT-RVF RVs. Multiple enriched gene ontology (GO) terms converged on mitochondria/metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The mitochondrial transcriptomic pathway is the most affected in RVF, with 413 dysregulated genes. Downregulated genes included  (-0.45-fold), suggesting impaired mitochondrial biogenesis,  (-3.8-fold), a monooxygenase which when downregulated increases oxidative stress, dehydrogenase/reductase 7C () (-2.8-fold), consistent with excessive autonomic activation, and polypeptide -acetyl-galactose-aminyl-transferase 13 (), a known pulmonary hypertension (PH) biomarker (-2.7-fold). The most up-regulated gene encodes Periostin (; 4.5-fold), a matricellular protein relevant to fibrosis. Other dysregulated genes relevant to fibrosis include latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 2 (), thrombospondin4 (). We also identified one dysregulated gene relevant to all disordered transcriptomic pathways, . This anti-inflammatory, phospholipid-binding mediator, is a putative target for therapy in RVF-PAH.

Particulate matter (PM) is one of the main components of air pollution, and there is increasing evidence that PM exposure exerts negative effects on the human skin. To see the impact of air pollution on skin aging, we analyzed the effect of PM exposure on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and gene analysis. Cultured HDFs were exposed to PM at a concentration of 30 µg/cm² for 24 h, and their gene/protein expression of inflammatory cytokines, fibroblast chemical mediators, and autophagy were assessed. A total of 1977 genes were found to be differentially expressed following PM exposure. We observed a significantly increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-33 in dermal fibroblasts exposed to PM. Protein expression of IL-6 and IL-8 also significantly increased, which complemented our gene analysis results. In addition, there was a significant increase in cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, MMP-3) mRNA expression, and significant decrease in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, collagen type I alpha chain (COL1A1, COL1A2), and elastin (ELN) mRNA expression in PM-exposed dermal fibroblasts. Protein expression of MMP-1 was significantly increased and that of TGF-β and procollagen profoundly decreased, similar to the gene analysis results. Autophagy, an integrated cellular stress response, was also increased while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis provided evidence of PM internalization in the autolysosomes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PM contributes to skin inflammation and skin aging via impaired collagen synthesis. Increased autophagy in our study suggests a reparative role of autophagy in HDFs stressed with PM, but its biological significance requires further research.\"\n",

Because of the damage caused by DR, there is an urgent need to develop effective drugs. Folic acid, a water-soluble vitamin, is one of the vitamin B complexes. Folic acid is widely found in the meat and vegetables. In the clinic, low folic acid levels in the body may have a certain correlation with DR. However, there is no relevant basic research proving a relationship between folic acid levels and DR. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether folic acid has a protective effect on the retinal vascular endothelial cells against high glucose levels. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of action of folic acid was further explored. The results showed that folic acid significantly suppressed the cell viability, tube length, migrated cells and the percentage of BrdU⁺ cells compared with the high glucose group. Moreover, folic acid decreased the mRNA expression of TEAD1 and the protein expression of TEAD1 and YAP1.

      "Abstract :'(L.) Mill. is a xerophylous plant that originated in tropical and subtropical America. This plant is popularly known in Brazil as \"palma forrageira\" (cactus pear) and plays a fundamental role in animal nutrition, mainly in the Northeastern semi-arid region of the country. The plant has several uses since it presents bioactive compounds that confer biological and pharmacological properties. In this context, the cactus pear can also be considered a potential product to combat parasite infections. The objective of this study was to chemically characterize the  hydroalcoholic extract (OFIEOH) and to determine its efficacy against gastrointestinal parasites using in vitro tests. Initially, the hydroalcoholic extract from cladode peels of  was produced by maceration for 21 days. For the chemical characterization, colorimetric dosages were performed for carbohydrates, proteins, phenols and condensed tannins. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry/electron spray ionization (LC-MS/ESI) was used to characterize the polyphenolic profile of the OFIEOH extract. Fifteen compounds were identified in the OFIEOH extract, such as methyl, glycosylated and aglycone quercetin derivatives and aglycone and glycosylated kaempferol derivatives. Tri-glycosylated methyl quercetin derivatives were the main compounds identified. In vitro egg hatch (EHT) and larval migration tests (LMT) were used in a range of concentrations of OFIEOH from 12.5 to 100 mg/mL for EHT and 12.5 to 200 mg/mL for LMT. In addition, the LMT was used to test ivermectin (IVM) (from 11.4 to 57.1 µM), associated with the inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC) for OFIEOH. The combination of OFIEOH (12.5 to 200 mg/mL) plus the IC of IVM was also tested. The efficacy of OFIEOH alone varied from 19.33 to 90.0% using the EHT. The LMT revealed an efficacy of 5.78 to 77.26% for the extract. Both tests showed a concentration-dependence inhibitory effect. We found a drug-extract antagonistic neutralizing effect when doses of IVM were added to OFIEOH (maximum efficacy of 73.78%), while a positive additive effect was observed when OFIEOH was added to the IC of IVM (IC of 82.79 for OFIEOH alone against an IC of 55.08 of OFIEOH + IVM). The data from this work indicate that OFIEOH alone may be considered as a suitable ecofriendly product to control gastrointestinal parasites of sheep, offering a more holistic approach to improve animal farming and welfare. The drug-extract interaction is also a promising therapeutic alternative, reducing the final dose to the host, with an optimum combination effect.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The freshwater crayfish  is an animal model employed for physiological and immunological studies and is also of great economic importance in aquaculture. Although it is a species of easy husbandry, a high percentage of its production is lost annually as a result of infectious diseases. Currently, genetic information about the immune system of crustaceans is limited. Therefore, we used the abdominal nerve cord from  to obtain its transcriptome using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify proteins that participate in the immune system. The reads were assembled de novo and consensus sequences with more than 3000 nucleotides were selected for analysis. The transcripts of the sequences of RNA were edited for annotation and sent to the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). We made a list of accession numbers of the sequences which were organized by the putative role of the immune system pathway in which they participate. In this work, we report on 80 proteins identified from the transcriptome of crayfish related to the immune system, 74 of them being the first reported for . We hope that the knowledge of these sequences will contribute significantly to the development of future studies of the immune system in crustaceans.'\n",

This study aimed to assess the effects of replacing carbohydrate energy in meals with half or whole avocado on postprandial indices of metabolic and vascular health. A single-center, randomized, controlled, 3-arm, 6 h, crossover study was conducted in overweight/obese middle-aged adults ( = 31). Participants consumed energy-matched breakfast meals containing 0 g (Control), 68 g (Half-A) or 136 g (Whole-A) fresh Hass avocado on 3 separate occasions. Post-meal glycemic ( < 0.0001), insulinemic ( < 0.0001) and flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) responses were reduced compared to Control meal ( < 0.01), independent of dose. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicated lower concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and higher concentrations of larger high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles after the Whole-A vs. the Control meal ( = 0.02,  < 0.05, respectively). Race/ethnicity influenced sub-class lipoprotein concentrations ( < 0.05). Oxidized low-density-lipoproteins, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6 were not different among meals. Tumor necrosis factor-α tended to be lower after Whole-A vs. Control meal ( = 0.07). Replacing carbohydrate components with avocados in a meal improved FMD, a measure of endothelial function, and improved glycemic and lipoprotein profiles in overweight/obese adults. The study provides insight on the acute cardio-metabolic benefits of incorporating avocados into a meal.'\n"

      "Abstract :'INTRODUCTION: Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) carry epigenetic information to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level. Crotonylation, one of the most important and common PTMs, plays a key role in the regulation of various biological processes. However, no study has evaluated the role of lysine crotonylation in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHP).\\n\\nMETHODS: Here, we comparatively evaluated the crotonylation proteome of normal controls (NC) and MHP using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with highly sensitive immune-affinity purification.\\n\\nRESULTS: A total of 1109 lysine modification sites distributed on 347 proteins were identified, including 93 and 252 crotonylated upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively. Thus, a decrease in crotonylation of histone proteins was observed in patients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Intensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that most of the crotonylated proteins were distributed in the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular region. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the crotonylated proteins were significantly enriched in the platelet alpha granule lumen, platelet degranulation, and cell adhesion molecule binding. In addition, protein domain, including fibrinogen alpha/beta/gamma chain, zinc finger, and WD40-repeat-containing domain, were significantly enriched in crotonylated proteins. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-based functional enrichment analysis revealed that crotonylated proteins were enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, cardiac muscle contraction, and hematopoietic cell lineage, all of which have important associations with hemodialysis complications.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the global crotonylation proteome of MHP. Lysine crotonylation was found to play important regulatory roles in pathophysiological processes in MHP.'\n",

Although chemotherapy and hormone therapy are able to control the symptoms caused by bone destruction, the underlying molecular mechanisms for the affinity of breast cancer cells towards skeletal bones are still not completely understood.\\n\\nMETHODS: In this study, bioinformatic analysis was performed on patients' microarray gene expression data to explore the molecular mechanism associated with breast cancer bone metastasis. Microarray gene expression profile regarding patients with breast cancer and disseminated tumor cells was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (NCBI, NIH). Raw data were normalized and differently expressed genes were identified by using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) methods. Protein interaction networks were expanded using String. Moreover, molecular functions, biological processes and signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).\\n\\nRESULTS: We identified 66 differentially expressed genes. After submitting the set of genes to String, genetic interaction network was expanded, which consisted of 110 nodes and 869 edges. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that adhesion kinase, ECM-receptor interaction, calcium signaling, Wnt pathways, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are highly associated with breast cancer bone metastasis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we established a microarray genetic interaction network associated with breast cancer bone metastasis. This information provides some potential molecular therapeutic targets for breast cancer initiation and progression.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Using the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii as a model, we developed nascent DNA labeling and the functional GFP-labeled single-stranded binding protein RPA2 as novel tools to gain new insight into DNA replication and repair in live haloarchaeal cells. Our quantitative fluorescence microscopy data revealed that RPA2 forms distinct replication structures that dynamically responded to replication stress and DNA damaging agents. The number of the RPA2 foci per cell followed a probabilistic Poisson distribution, implying hitherto unnoticed stochastic cell-to-cell variation in haloarchaeal DNA replication and repair processes. The size range of haloarchaeal replication structures is very similar to those observed earlier in eukaryotic cells. The improved lateral resolution of 3D-SIM fluorescence microscopy allowed proposing that inhibition of DNA synthesis results in localized replication foci clustering and facilitated observation of RPA2 complexes brought about by chemical agents creating DNA double-strand breaks. Altogether our in vivo observations are compatible with earlier in vitro studies on archaeal single-stranded DNA binding proteins. Our work thus underlines the great potential of live cell imaging for unraveling the dynamic nature of transient molecular interactions that underpin fundamental molecular processes in the Third domain of life.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Gene expression programs change during cellular transitions. It is well established that a network of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers regulate RNA levels during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, but the full impact of post-transcriptional processes remains elusive. While cytoplasmic RNA turnover mechanisms have been implicated in differentiation, the contribution of nuclear RNA decay has not been investigated. Here, we differentiate mouse ESCs, depleted for the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome, into embryoid bodies to determine to which degree RNA abundance in the two states can be attributed to changes in transcription versus RNA decay by the exosome. As a general observation, we find that exosome depletion mainly leads to the stabilization of RNAs from lowly transcribed loci, including several protein-coding genes. Depletion of the nuclear exosome cofactor RBM7 leads to similar effects. In particular, transcripts that are differentially expressed between states tend to be more exosome sensitive in the state where expression is low. We conclude that the RNA exosome contributes to down-regulation of transcripts with disparate expression, often in conjunction with transcriptional down-regulation.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Negative feedback is known to enable biological and man-made systems to perform reliably in the face of uncertainties and disturbances. To date, synthetic biological feedback circuits have primarily relied upon protein-based, transcriptional regulation to control circuit output. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that can inhibit translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this work, we modelled, built and validated two synthetic negative feedback circuits that use rationally-designed sRNAs for the first time. The first circuit builds upon the well characterised tet-based autorepressor, incorporating an externally-inducible sRNA to tune the effective feedback strength. This allows more precise fine-tuning of the circuit output in contrast to the sigmoidal, steep input-output response of the autorepressor alone. In the second circuit, the output is a transcription factor that induces expression of an sRNA, which inhibits translation of the mRNA encoding the output, creating direct, closed-loop, negative feedback. Analysis of the noise profiles of both circuits showed that the use of sRNAs did not result in large increases in noise. Stochastic and deterministic modelling of both circuits agreed well with experimental data. Finally, simulations using fitted parameters allowed dynamic attributes of each circuit such as response time and disturbance rejection to be investigated.'\n"

Intestinal inorganic phosphate (Pi) handling plays an important role in Pi homeostasis in CKD. We investigated whether intestinal alkaline phosphatase 3 (Akp3), the enzyme that hydrolyzes dietary Pi compounds, is a target for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD.\\n\\nMETHODS: We investigated Pi homeostasis in Akp3 knockout mice (Akp3-/-). We also studied the progression of renal failure in an Akp3-/- mouse adenine treated renal failure model. Plasma, fecal, and urinary Pi and Ca concentration were measured with commercially available kit, and plasma fibroblast growth factor 23, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration were measured with ELISA. Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from mouse intestine using the Ca2+ precipitation method and used for Pi transport activity and alkaline phosphatase activity. In vivo intestinal Pi absorption was measured with oral 32P administration.\\n\\nRESULTS: Akp3-/- mice exhibited reduced intestinal type II sodium-dependent Pi transporter (Npt2b) protein levels and Na-dependent Pi co-transport activity. In addition, plasma active vitamin D levels were significantly increased in Akp3-/- mice compared with wild-type animals. In the adenine-induced renal failure model, Akp3 gene deletion suppressed hyperphosphatemia.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that intestinal Akp3 deletion affects Na+-dependent Pi transport in the small intestine. In the adenine-induced renal failure model, Akp3 is predicted to be a factor contributing to suppression of the plasma Pi concentration.'\n",

In viscachas, a seasonal breeding rodent, pregnancy lasts approximately 154 days and 3 stages can be defined, i.e., early, mid, and late pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to analyze morphometric variations in the expression of S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and vimentin in the interstitial cells (IC) in pregnant and nonpregnant viscachas by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also aim to evaluate a probable relation between glandular activity and pregnancy. The immunopositive percentage area (%IA) for the studied proteins and the number of immunoreactive cells against the S-100 protein with a visible nucleus (nº IC-S-100) were analyzed. Estradiol and progesterone serum levels were also determined by RIA. Variations in the expression of the S-100 protein and GFAP, as well as changes in the nº IC-S-100 related to serum hormone levels, were found between pregnant and nonpregnant viscachas. Viscachas in mid pregnancy exhibited the highest values of %IA for the analyzed proteins, followed by females in late and early pregnancy, while the nonpregnant ones showed the lowest values for all of the groups studied. Likewise, the nº IC-S-100 also varied following the same pattern. Thus, these variations seem to indicate a direct relationship between glandular activity and gonadal hormone levels. On these grounds, we may conclude that IC undergo changes in relation to ovarian hormone levels and participate in the regulation of glandular activity during pregnancy. However, further research is necessary to elucidate this relationship.'\n",

At present, no effective prophylactic treatment method is available. This study investigated the anti-fibrotic effects of total flavonoids (TFs) extracted from leaves of Carya Cathayensis in vivo and in vitro, and explored the underlying mechanisms.\\n\\nMETHODS: Anti-fibrotic effects of TFs were measured using a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-treated mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). mRNA expression and protein levels of Collagen I, Collagen III, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were also tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, expression of miR-21 was examined in mTECs treated with TFs using miR-21 mimics transfected into mTECs before TGF-β1 and TFs treatment. Regulation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) signaling by miR-21 was subsequently validated via overexpression and deletion of miR-21 followed by a luciferase assay.\\n\\nRESULTS: TFs treatment attenuated renal fibrosis, and inhibited expression of collagens and α-SMA in the kidneys of mice subjected to UUO. In vitro, the TFs significantly decreased expression of fibrotic markers in TGF-β1-treated mTECs. Moreover, TFs reduced miR-21 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mTECs, increased expression of Smad7, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad3. Treatment with miR-21 mimics abolished the anti-fibrotic effects of the TFs on the TGF-β1-treated mTECs. In addition, genetic deletion of miR-21 upregulated expression of Smad7 and suppressed phosphorylation of Smad3, attenuating renal fibrosis in mice. Bioinformatics predictions revealed the potential binding site of miR-21 in the 3'-untranslated region of Smad7, and this was further confirmed by the luciferase assay.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: TFs ameliorate renal fibrosis via a miR-21/Smad7 signaling pathway, indicating a potential therapy for the prevention of renal fibrosis.\"\n",

CircRNAs contain microRNA (miRNA) binding sites and can function as miRNA sponges to regulate gene expression by removing the inhibitory effect of an miRNA on its target gene.\\n\\nMETHODS: We used the bioinformatics software TargetScan and miRanda to predict circRNA-miRNA and miRNAi-Mrna interactions. Rate of inhibiting of proliferation was measured using a WST-8 cell proliferation assay. Clone formation ability was assessed with a clone formation inhibition test. Cell invasion and migration capacity was evaluated by performing a Transwell assay. Relative gene expression was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and relative protein expression levels were determined with western blotting. circRNA and miRNA interaction was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA-pull down assays.\\n\\nRESULTS: In the present study, the miRNA hsa-miR-21-5p was a target of circRNA-ACAP2, and T lymphoma invasion and metastasis protein 1 (Tiam1) was identified as a target gene of hsa-miR-21-5p. CircRNA-ACAP2 and Tiam1 were shown to be highly expressed in colon cancer tissue and colon cancer SW480 cells, but miR-21-5p was expressed at a low level. SW480 cell proliferation was suppressed when the expression of circRNA-ACAP2 and Tiam1 was decreased and the expression of miR-21-5p was increased in vivo and in vitro. SW480 cell migration and invasion were also inhibited under the same circumstance. The circRNA-ACAP2 interaction regulated the expression of miR-21-5p, and miR-21-5p regulated the expression of Tiam1. Down-regulation of circRNA-ACAP2 promoted miR-21-5p expression, which further suppressed the transcription and translation of Tiam1.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The present study shows that the circRNA-ACAP2/hsa-miR-21-5p/Tiam1 regulatory feedback circuit could affect the proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer SW480 cells. This was probably due to the fact that circRNA-ACAP2 could act as a miRNA sponge to regulate Tiam1 expression by removing the inhibitory effect of miR-21-5p on Tiam1 expression. The results from this study have revealed new insights into the pathogenicity of colon cancer and may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of colon cancer.'\n"

The cross-reactivity between seed storage proteins from different sources has not been studied at a molecular level so far. This study aimed to ascertain the cross-reactivity between walnut and hazelnut seed storage proteins using recombinant allergens. Sera from 13 consecutive patients with severe primary walnut and/or hazelnut allergy and hypersensitive to both nuts were studied. IgE specific for rCor a 9, rCor a 14, and rJug r 1 was measured, and inhibition experiments were carried out by measuring IgE reactivity after absorption of patients' sera with freshly prepared walnut extract. All 13 sera showed strong IgE reactivity against walnut 2S albumin, Jug r 1, 12 reacted to hazelnut 2S albumin, Cor a 14, and 8 to the hazelnut legumin, Cor a 9. In inhibition experiments, absorption of sera with whole walnut extract led to the complete disappearance of IgE reactivity to Jug r 1 in 12/13 cases, as expected, but also to the complete disappearance of specific IgE to Cor a 14 in 9/12 sera, and of IgE reactivity to Cor a 9 in 7/8. In the remaining cases a dramatic drop in IgE reactivity was observed. The study shows that patients primarily allergic to either walnut or hazelnut showing a skin or serological reactivity to the other nut also are potentially at risk of severe allergic reactions caused by cross-reactivity between 2S albumins and legumins.\"\n",

We have previously identified TXNRD1, primarily expressed by airway epithelia, as a promising therapeutic target to prevent lung injury, likely via nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent mechanisms. The present studies utilized the TXNRD1 inhibitor auranofin (AFN) to test the hypothesis that Se positively influences Nrf2 activation and selenoenzyme responses in lung epithelial cells.

      "Abstract :'A novel innate immune strategy, involving specific cholesterol oxidation products as effectors, has begun to reveal connections between cholesterol metabolism and immune response against viral infections. Indeed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), physiologically produced by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol, act as inhibitors of a wide spectrum of enveloped and non-enveloped human viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying their protective effects against non-enveloped viruses are almost completely unexplored. To get insight into this field, we investigated the antiviral activity of 25HC and 27HC against a non-enveloped virus causing acute gastroenteritis in children, the human rotavirus (HRV). We found that 25HC and 27HC block the infectivity of several HRV strains at 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range in the absence of cell toxicity. Both molecules affect the final step of virus penetration into cells by preventing the association of two cellular proteins: the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A). By altering the activity of these cellular mediators, 25HC and 27HC disturb the recycling of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum and the late endosomes which are exploited by HRV to penetrate into the cell. The substantial accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment results in sequestering viral particles inside these vesicles thereby preventing cytoplasmic virus replication. These findings suggest that cholesterol oxidation products of enzymatic origin might be primary effectors of host restriction strategies to counteract HRV infection and point to redox active lipids involvement in viral infections as a research area of focus to better focus in order to identify novel antiviral agents targets.'\n",

      "Abstract :'GPR40, also known as free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1), is a member of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) family and has emerged as an attractive target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. So far, most of the synthetic GPR40 agonists, including several drug candidates discontinued in clinical trials, were derived from the phenylpropionic acid scaffold. For discovering novel GPR40 agonists with diverse chemical structures, a series of phenylpropiolic acid derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated under a battery of bioassays. Compound 9, the most potent compound in this series, exhibited submicromolar agonist activity and similar agonistic efficacy compared to that of TAK-875. In addition, compound 9 was able to dose-dependently amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, which could be reversed by a selective GPR40 antagonist GW1100. In addition, compound 9 was found to have potent glucose-lowering effects during an oral glucose tolerance test in normal C57BL/6 mice.'\n"

In this study, we found that OsJMJ703, a known histone demethylase, is expressed in various tissues. Furthermore, over-expression of OsJMJ703 influenced the type of rice panicle, and knock-down of the expression of OsJMJ703 showed an earlier flowering time in rice. In addition, OsJMJ703 is involved in abiotic stress. Transgenic rice of over-expressing OsJMJ703 is sensitive to drought stress, whereas knocking down OsJMJ703 enhances the tolerance to drought stress. This study provides a theoretical basis of the biological function of JmjC protein and further promotes the study of drought resistance.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are the two major mechanisms for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells. Previously, we designed an assay for detecting NHEJ activity by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, however, this approach cannot be used to predict the activity of HR repair. Hence, we developed a novel method that is capable of quantitatively measuring both HR and NHEJ activities via CRISPR/Cas9-induced oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)-mediated DSB repair. In the present experimental procedures, the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid was cotransfected with single-stranded ODN (ssODN) or blunt-ended double-stranded ODN (dsODN), both of which harbored a unique marker sequence. After the induction of site-specific DSBs by CRISPR/Cas9 system, the ssODN, functioned as the donor template for HR repair, could insert the marker sequence into the DSB sites, while the dsODN was embedded in the DSB sites through NHEJ pathway. Next, by means of PCR analysis using a specific primer for the marker sequence and the primers that flank the DSB sites, the relative amount of integrated marker sequence in the genomic DNA could be quantitatively determined. The correlation between the marker sequence abundance and the HR and NHEJ activities was confirmed by using the selective HR and NHEJ inhibitors. This accessible and rapid quantitative assay for HR and NHEJ activities might be useful for the future research of the DSB repair mechanisms.'\n",

We investigated the toxic effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) on budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and elucidated the underlying mechanism. We observed cell wall damage and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to cell death upon ZnO-NPs exposure. We detected a significant change in the cellular distribution of lipid biosynthetic enzymes (Fas1 and Fas2). Furthermore, exposure of ZnO-NPs altered the architecture of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria as well as ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex causing cellular toxicity due to lipid disequilibrium and proteostasis. We also observed significant changes in heat shock and unfolded protein responses, monitored by Hsp104-GFP localization and cytosolic Hac1 splicing respectively. Moreover, we observed activation of MAP kinases of CWI (Mpk1) and HOG (Hog1) pathways upon exposure to ZnO-NPs. Transcript level analyses showed induction of chitin synthesis and redox homeostasis genes. Finally, we observed induction in lipid droplets (LDs) formation, distorted vacuolar morphology and induction of autophagy as monitored by localization of Atg8p. However, we did not observe any significant change in epigenetic marks, examined by western blotting. Altogether, we provide evidence that exposure of ZnO-NPs results in cell death by affecting cell wall integrity and ER homeostasis as well as accumulation of ROS and saturated free fatty acids.'\n",

Inflammatory cytokine levels were assessed by ELISA. Kidney injury of rats was evaluated by blood glucose, serum creatinine and blood urine nitrogen concentrations and periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining.

The possible mechanisms relating to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration are yet to be thoroughly understood. Rutin, a flavonoid, has been well documented for its beneficial and pharmacological activities against diverse targets. However, the mechanism involved in the beneficial effects of rutin against neurodegeneration still remains unclear.

IMR32 cells were differentiated using retinoic acid and challenged with different doses of rutin for 24\\u2009h duration to study the influence of ROS on differentiated neuronal cells and ROS-mediated apoptosis. The study showed that the high (100 μM) and low (100\\u2009nM and 10μM) rutin concentrations significantly avert ROS generation by two different mechanisms, by enhancing apoptosis through the modulation of levels of Bcl2, Caspase-3, survivin and its antioxidant activity via stress-related proteins, JNK and p38 MAPK.

Despite abundant circulating levels of progranulin, the size of atherosclerotic lesions in Tx-KO mice was increased by 47% in aortic roots and by 62% in whole aortas. Aortic root lesions in Tx-KO mice had increased macrophage content and larger necrotic cores, consistent with more advanced lesions. Progranulin staining was markedly reduced in the lesions of Tx-KO mice, indicating little or no uptake of circulating progranulin. Mechanistically, cultured progranulin-deficient macrophages exhibited increased lysosome-mediated exophagy of aggregated low-density lipoproteins resulting in increased cholesterol uptake and foam cell formation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that hematopoietic progranulin deficiency promotes diet-induced atherosclerosis in Ldlr mice, possibly due to increased exophagy-mediated cholesterol uptake. Circulating progranulin was unable to prevent the increased lesion development, consistent with the importance of progranulin acting via cell-autonomous or local effects.'\n",

It is unknown whether protein kinases besides CPKs and RLCKs participate in RBOHD regulation. We screened mutants in all ten Arabidopsis MAP4 kinases (MAP4Ks) and identified the conserved MAP4K SIK1 as a positive regulator of PTI. sik1 mutants were compromised in their ability to elicit the ROS burst in response to microbial features and exhibited compromised PTI to bacterial infection. SIK1 directly interacts with, phosphorylates, and stabilizes BIK1 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, SIK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates RBOHD upon flagellin perception. Thus, SIK1 positively regulates immunity by stabilizing BIK1 and activating RBOHD to promote the extracellular ROS burst.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Despite a wealth of potential applications inside target cells, protein-based therapeutics are largely limited to extracellular targets due to the inability of proteins to readily cross biological membranes and enter the cytosol. Bacterial toxins, which deliver a cytotoxic enzyme into cells as part of their intoxication mechanism, hold great potential as platforms for delivering therapeutic protein cargo into cells. Diphtheria toxin (DT) has been shown to be capable of delivering an array of model proteins of varying sizes, structures, and stabilities into mammalian cells as amino-terminal fusions. Here, seeking to expand the utility of DT as a delivery vector, we asked whether an active human enzyme, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), could be delivered by DT into cells to rescue PNP deficiency. Using a series of biochemical and cellular readouts, we demonstrate that PNP is efficiently delivered into target cells in a receptor- and translocation-dependent manner. In patient-derived PNP-deficient lymphocytes and pluripotent stem cell-differentiated neurons, we show that human PNP is efficiently translocated into target cells by DT, where it is able to restore intracellular hypoxanthine levels. Further, through replacement of the native receptor-binding moiety of DT with single-chain variable fragments that were selected to bind mouse HBEGF, we show that PNP can be retargeted into mouse splenocytes from PNP-deficient mice, resulting in restoration of the proliferative capacity of T-cells. These findings highlight the versatility of the DT delivery platform and provide an attractive approach for the delivery of\\xa0PNP as well as other cytosolic enzymes implicated in disease.'\n",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into cells that exhibited a BBB-like phenotype on COL1 hydrogels, which included the expression of key BBB-specific proteins and low permeability of representative small and large molecule therapeutics. Furthermore, the BBB phenotype observed on the COL1 hydrogel was similar to that previously reported on porous inserts. The intracellular visualization of two small molecule efflux pump substrates within the hiPSC-derived BBB-like cells demonstrated a difference in cytosolic and vesicular accumulation, which complemented permeability measurements demonstrating a difference in transport rate. The easy-to-construct COL1-based hiPSC-derived BBB model presented here is the first in vitro two-dimensional BBB experimental system that enables the simultaneous quantification of cellular permeability and visualization of intracellular processes by utilizing confocal microscopy, which can provide insights regarding the relationship between transport and intracellular trafficking of therapeutic drugs.'\n",

Protein corona formation, in vitro uptake, effect on cell viability and proliferation, and in vivo biodistribution of these NPs were determined. The relation of the results of the different NPs was analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis, which will tell which NPs have the most similar physicochemical properties and biological effects, without having to specify individual physicochemical parameters. The results show that the physicochemical properties of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are mainly accounted for by their hydrodynamic diameter and their zeta-potential. The formation of the protein corona is determined by the pH-dependence of their zeta-potential. While several reports found that in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs are correlated to individual physicochemical parameters, e. g., size, shape, or surface chemistry, such direct dependence in the investigated multidimensional set of NPs was not found in our study. This most likely is due to entanglement of the different parameters, which complicates the prediction of the biological effect of NPs in case multiple physicochemical properties are simultaneously varied. The in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs seem to be not directly driven by the protein corona, but the physicochemical properties determine as well the corona as they influence in vitro/ in vivo behaviors, and thus the effect of the protein corona would be rather indirect.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Cells infected with Salmonella are characterised by the appearance of membrane tubular structures that stretch from the bacterial vacuole. The formation of these tubules requires the translocation of Salmonella effector proteins within the infected cell. Different types of Salmonella-induced tubules with varying host protein compositions have been identified. This variability probably reflects the ability of these tubules to interact with different host compartments. Membrane tubules decorated with effector proteins but essentially devoid of host proteins and named LAMP1-negative (LNT) were observed. LNTs wrap around LAMP1-positive vesicles and may promote recruitment of lysosomal glycoproteins to bacterial vacuole and the formation of a replication niche. We conducted a biochemical and functional characterisation of LNTs. We show that the effector proteins SseF and SseG are necessary for their formation. The absence of these tubules is associated with decreased recruitment of LAMP1 to SCVs, decreased intracellular replication of Salmonella, and decreased virulence in mice. We found that the process leading to the recruitment of lysosomal glycoproteins to tubules involves the C-terminal domain of the effector protein SifA and the GTPase Arl8b. Overall, these data suggest that Salmonella-induced tubules promote the establishment of the replication niche by promoting recruitment of host proteins to the bacterial vacuole.'\n",

Urodynamic test showed that MDSCs and ADSC improved the function of urination in rats with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), and effect of MDSCs-treatment was more pronounced. In addition, histologic analysis showed that the MDSCs and ADSC-treated groups had significantly higher myosin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) content than the control group. Compared with ADSC-treated groups, the MDSCs-treated groups in myosin and α-SMA content showed the tendency of increase. In summary, MDSCs and ADSCs have obvious effects in the treatment and/or prevention of ISD and transplantation of MDSCs is more effective than ADSC. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(10):976-984, 2018.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Chlamydia has a unique intracellular developmental cycle, which has hindered the single protein function study of Chlamydia. Recently developed transformation system of Chlamydia has greatly advanced the chlamydial protein's function research and was used to find that a chlamydial plasmid-encoded Pgp5 protein can down-regulate plasmid-dependent genes. It is assumed, that chlamydial genomic MinD protein has a similar function to Pgp5. However, it is unknown whether MinD protein regulates the same plasmid-dependent genes. We replaced pgp5 gene in the shuttle vector pGFP::CM with minD gene of C. trachomatis (CT0582) or C. muridarum (TC0871). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into plasmid-free organisms-CMUT3 and qRT-PCR was used to detect the transcription level of plasmid-encoded and -dependent genes in these pgp5 deficient organisms. As a readout, GlgA, one of the plasmid-regulated gene products was detected by immunofluorescence assay. After recombination, transformation and plaque purification, the stable transformants CT0582R and TC0871R were generated. In these transformants, the plasmid-dependent genes were up-regulated, alike in the pgp5 premature stop mutant and pgp5 replacement with mCherry mutant. GlgA protein level was also increased in all pgp5 mutants, including CT0582R and TC0871R. Thus, our study showed that genomic MinD protein had different function than Pgp5, which was useful for further understanding the chlamydiae.\"\n",

Identifying the effects of different solvents on OA-induced liver lipid deposition would be beneficial for studies on hepatocytes. We treated BRL 3A cells with OA dissolved in different solvents. After 12 h incubation, cell viability was assessed using MTT assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) counts, and the expression level of glucose regulated protein (GRP78), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1C) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were analyzed. Water, PBS and DMSO were disadvantageous to the dissolution of OA and did not cause an OA-induced response in hepatocytes. In the alcohol+OA-treated cells, the severe ER stress, oxidative stress and cellular fat deposition were significantly increased. BSA promoted cell growth and the cells treated with 1.2% BSA+OA showed a lower grade TG and endoplasmic reticulum stress compared with KOH+OA and alcohol+OA treatments. KOH had no significant influence on BRL 3A cells viability. When treated with OA dissolved in KOH, BRL 3A cells showed a typical hepatocyte damage. KOH was considered the suitable choice for an OA solvent for BRL 3A cells in hepatic lipidosis research.'\n",

The Holstein cattle kept in Slovak Republic exhibit a high value of homozygosity (0.7222) and low values of polymorphism information content (0.2392), effective number of alleles (1.3847) and level of possible variability realization (27.91%). The effect of polymorphism of CSN3 gene on average breeding values for milk production traits, such as yield of milk, fat and protein expressed in kilograms, as well as percentage content of fat and protein in milk, has been assessed. In our assessment of the observed traits' variability's dependence on CSN3 gene polymorphism, we detected a statistically significant difference between genotypes only in case of the average breeding value for the percentage of protein in milk.\"\n"

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Antigen presentation on monocyte surface to T-cells by Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II (MHC-II) molecules is fundamental for pathogen recognition and efficient host response. Accordingly, loss of Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR (HLA-DR) surface expression indicates impaired monocyte functionality in patients suffering from sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Besides the impact of Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator (CIITA) on MHC-II gene expression, X box-like (XL) sequences have been proposed as further regulatory elements. These elements are bound by the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF), a superordinate modulator of gene transcription. Here, we hypothesized a differential interaction of CTCF with the MHC-II locus contributing to an altered monocyte response in immunocompromised septic patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: We collected blood from six patients diagnosed with sepsis and six healthy controls. Flow cytometric analysis was used to identify sepsis-induced immune suppression, while inflammatory cytokine levels in blood were determined via ELISA. Isolation of CD14++ CD16-monocytes was followed by (i) RNA extraction for gene expression analysis and (ii) chromatin immunoprecipitation to assess the distribution of CTCF and chromatin modifications in selected MHC-II regions.\\n\\nRESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, CD14++ CD16-monocytes from septic patients with immune suppression displayed an increased binding of CTCF within the MHC-II locus combined with decreased transcription of CIITA gene. In detail, enhanced CTCF enrichment was detected on the intergenic sequence XL9 separating two subregions coding for MHC-II genes. Depending on the relative localisation to XL9, gene expression of both regions was differentially affected in patients with sepsis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that differential CTCF binding at XL9 is accompanied by uncoupled MHC-II expression as well as transcriptional and epigenetic alterations of the MHC-II regulator CIITA in septic patients. Overall, our findings indicate a sepsis-induced enhancer blockade mediated by variation of CTCF at the intergenic sequence XL9 in altered monocytes during immunosuppression.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of three human malignancies, the endothelial cell cancer Kaposi's sarcoma, and two B cell cancers, Primary Effusion Lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV has latent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute to viral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis. Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA, and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify host chromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition, we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins for their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulators of viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi1, PTC-209, two additional histone deacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomain inhibitor (+)-JQ1. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viral genome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, and results in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi1 induces KSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi1, a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 1, is critical for maintaining KSHV latency.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Hypoxemia in humans may occur during high altitude mountaineering and in patients suffering from ventilatory insufficiencies such as cardiovascular- or respiratory disease including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In these conditions, hypoxemia has been correlated to reduced appetite and decreased food intake. Since hypoxemia and reduced food intake intersect in various physiological and pathological conditions and both induce loss of muscle mass, we investigated whether hypoxia aggravates fasting-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and evaluated underlying protein turnover signaling.\\n\\nMETHODS: Mice were kept under hypoxic (8% oxygen) or normoxic conditions (21% oxygen), or were pair-fed to the hypoxia group for 12 days. Following an additional 24 hours of fasting, muscle weight and protein turnover signaling were assessed in the gastrocnemius muscle by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.\\n\\nRESULTS: Loss of gastrocnemius muscle mass in response to fasting in the hypoxic group was increased compared to the normoxic group, but not to the pair-fed normoxic control group. Conversely, the fasting-induced increase in poly-ubiquitin conjugation, and expression of the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome E3 ligases, autophagy-lysosomal degradation-related mRNA transcripts and proteins, and markers of the integrated stress response (ISR), were attenuated in the hypoxia group compared to the pair-fed group. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) downstream signaling was reduced by fasting under normoxic conditions, but sustained under hypoxic conditions. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) / tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) signaling by fasting was absent, in line with retained mTORC1 activity under hypoxic conditions. Similarly, hypoxia suppressed AMPK-mediated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling following fasting, which corresponded with blunted proteolytic signaling responses.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia aggravates fasting-induced muscle wasting, and suppresses AMPK and ISR activation. Altered AMPK-mediated regulation of mTORC1 and GR may underlie aberrant protein turnover signaling and affect muscle atrophy responses in hypoxic skeletal muscle.'\n",

Chemically-induced mouse models for fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis are widely-applied, resembling the corresponding human disease. Nonetheless, a long time is necessary for the development of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions. Thus, we proposed an early fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis model for male and female mice separately, focusing on reducing the experimental time for preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions development and establishing standard models for both sexes. Then, two-week old susceptible C3H/HeJ male and female mice (n = 8 animals/sex/group) received a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 10 or 50 mg/Kg). During 2 months, mice received 3 weekly doses of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, 10% corn oil solution, 0.25 to 1.50 μL/g b.wt.) and they were euthanized at week 17. DEN/CCl4 protocols for males and females displayed clear liver fibrosis, featuring collagen accumulation and hepatic stellate cell activation (α-SMA). In addition, liver from males displayed increased CD68+ macrophage number, COX-2 protein expression and IL-6 levels. The DEN/CCl4 models in both sexes impaired antioxidant defense as well as enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, DEN/CCl4-treated male and female developed multiple preneoplastic altered hepatocyte foci and hepatocellular adenomas. As expected, the models showed clear male bias. Therefore, we established standard and suitable fibrosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis models for male and female mice, shortening the experimental time for the development of hepatocellular preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions in comparison to other classical models.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Salicylic acid (SA) is a key phytohormone that mediates a broad spectrum of resistance against a diverse range of viruses; however, the downstream pathway of SA governed antiviral immune response remains largely to be explored. Here, we identified an orchid protein containing A20 and AN1 zinc finger domains, designated Pha13. Pha13 is up-regulated upon virus infection, and the transgenic monocot orchid and dicot Arabidopsis overexpressing orchid Pha13 conferred greater resistance to different viruses. In addition, our data showed that Arabidopsis homolog of Pha13, AtSAP5, is also involved in virus resistance. Pha13 and AtSAP5 are early induced by exogenous SA treatment, and participate in the expression of SA-mediated immune responsive genes, including the master regulator gene of plant immunity, NPR1, as well as NPR1-independent virus defense genes. SA also induced the proteasome degradation of Pha13. Functional domain analysis revealed that AN1 domain of Pha13 is involved in expression of orchid NPR1 through its AN1 domain, whereas dual A20/AN1 domains orchestrated the overall virus resistance. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that Pha13 can be found localized in the nucleus. Self-ubiquitination assay revealed that Pha13 confer E3 ligase activity, and the main E3 ligase activity was mapped to the A20 domain. Identification of Pha13 interacting proteins and substrate by yeast two-hybrid screening revealed mainly ubiquitin proteins. Further detailed biochemical analysis revealed that A20 domain of Pha13 binds to various polyubiquitin chains, suggesting that Pha13 may interact with multiple ubiquitinated proteins. Our findings revealed that Pha13 serves as an important regulatory hub in plant antiviral immunity, and uncover a delicate mode of immune regulation through the coordination of A20 and/or AN1 domains, as well as through the modulation of E3 ligase and ubiquitin chain binding activity of Pha13.'\n"

However, functions of this cassette in other cellular processes are not well understood. Here, we found that the Botrytis cinerea mutant of MAPK kinase (BcMkk1) displays more serious defects in mycelial growth, conidiation, responses to cell wall and oxidative stresses, but possesses less reduced virulence than the mutants of its upstream (BcBck1) and downstream (BcBmp3) kinases. Interestingly, BcMkk1, but not BcBck1 and BcBmp3, negatively regulates production of oxalic acid (OA) and activity of extracellular hydrolases (EHs) that are proposed to be virulence factors of B. cinerea. Moreover, we obtained evidence that BcMkk1 negatively controls OA production via impeding phosphorylation of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) kinase BcRim15 by the Ser/Thr kinase BcSch9. In addition, the fungal Pro40 homolog BcPro40 was found to interact simultaneously with three MAPKs, implying that BcPro40 is a scaffold protein of the CWI pathway in B. cinerea. Taken together, results of this study reveal that BcMkk1 negatively modulates virulence via suppressing OA biosynthesis in B. cinerea, which provides novel insight into conserved and species-specific functions of the MAPK kinase in fungi.'\n",

Hypothesising that genes involved in remobilisation of P from leaves during grain filling would show altered expression in response to P deprivation, we investigated gene expression in rice flag leaves at 8 days after anthesis (DAA) and 16 DAA in plants that received a continuous supply of P in the nutrient solution vs plants where P was omitted from the nutrient solution for 8 consecutive days prior to measurement. The transcriptional response to growth in the absence of P differed between the early stage (8 DAA) and the later stage (16 DAA) of grain filling. At 8 DAA, rice plants maintained production of energy substrates through upregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis. In contrast, at 16 DAA carbon substrates were produced by degradation of structural polysaccharides and over 50% of highly upregulated genes in P-deprived plants were associated with protein degradation and nitrogen/amino acid transport, suggesting withdrawal of P from the nutrient solution led to accelerated senescence. Genes involved in liberating inorganic P from the organic P compounds and vacuolar P transporters displayed differential expression depending on the stage of grain filling stage and timing of P withdrawal.'\n",

Peroxisomes are distributed in a similar way as PPARγ in the lung and are mainly enriched in club and AECII cells. To date, the effects of PPARγ-deficiency on the overall peroxisomal compartment and its metabolic alterations in pulmonary club cells are unknown. Therefore, we characterized wild-type and club cell-specific PPARγ knockout-mice lungs and used C22 cells to investigate the peroxisomal compartment and its metabolic roles in the distal airway epithelium by means of 1) double-immunofluorescence labelling for peroxisomal proteins, 2) laser-assisted microdissection of the bronchiolar epithelium and subsequent qRT-PCR, 3) siRNA-transfection of PPARγand PPRE dual-luciferase reporter activity in C22 cells, 4) PPARg inhibition by GW9662, 5) GC-MS based lipid analysis. Our results reveal elevated levels of fatty acids, increased expression of PPARα and PPRE activity, a strong overall upregulation of the peroxisomal compartment and its associated gene expression (biogenesis, α-oxidation, β-oxidation, and plasmalogens) in PPARγ-deficient club cells. Interestingly, catalase was significantly increased and mistargeted into the cytoplasm, suggestive for oxidative stress by the PPARγ-deficiency in club cells. Taken together, PPARα-mediated metabolic induction and proliferation of peroxisomes via a PPRE-dependent mechanism could compensate PPARγ-deficiency in club cells.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disorder, manifesting with a reduction in bone mass and deterioration of the microarchitecture. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have an innate ability to differentiate into several cell types, including osteoblasts (OB). Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) is an ethanol extract from ginseng and contains a highly concentrated form of ginsenoside. GRb1 shows extensive beneficial health effects such as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, modulating the immune system and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. We hypothesized that GRb1 can promote MSC differentiation into OBs and inhibit bone loss. In the present study, we aimed to address two questions: (1) Will GRb1 have a positive effect on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs? and (2) Will GRb1 halt bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats? We investigated the effects of GRb1 on viability and osteogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). Our results showed that GRb1 at concentrations of 10-8 M and 10-6 M can increase alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization and the expression of osteogenic related proteins, such as osteopontin and osteoprotegerin, while incubating rMSCs with osteogenic induction medium and GRb1. Adding GRb1 into the medium can prevent rMSCs from Oxidative damage at the concentration of 25μM H2O2. Furthermore, 40 4-month-old rats were assigned to 5 groups(8 rats per group): the basal group, the sham group, the OVX group, the high dose of GRb1 group (6 mg/kg/day) and the low dose of GRb1 group (3 mg/kg/day). Rats recrived treatment 3days after surgery and last for 14 weeks. Examinations included serum analysis, mechanical testing, Masson-Goldner trichrome staining and bone histomorphometry analysis. The results showed that OVX can lead to dyslipidemia and excessive oxidative stress, whereas GRb1 cannot significantly halt dyslipidemia and excessive oxidative stress in OVX rats. In addition, the bone density of the lumbar vertebra and femur were decreased significantly in the OVX rats, and GRb1 could not inhibit bone loss. Bone histomorphometry analysis showed that the number and width of bone trabecula of the tibia were reduced in OVX rats, and GRb1 could not prevent their occurrence. A bone biomechanics assay showed that GRb1 cannot improve the ability of bone structure to resist fracture of the femur in OVX rats. The current study demonstrated that GRb1 has an obvious effect on osteogenic differentiation in rMSCs but no obvious effect on bone loss in OVX rats. These findings indicate GRb1 has a positive effect on rMSCs but does not have an effect on bone loss in OVX rats at the concentration we used.'\n"

Derived from an unusual secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets. Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here, we combine proximity biotinylation-based proteomics (BioID) and a new machine learning algorithm to generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins. Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BioID studies of unique parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77% are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.'\n",

In the present study, high-throughput and Sanger sequencing of RNA was used to obtain the LCV-SP full-length sequence. The LCV-SP genome comprises 8825 nt and 8672 nt long RNA1 and RNA2 respectively. RNA1 of LCV-SP contains four ORFs, the proteins encoded by the ORF1a and ORF1b are closely related to LCV RNA1 from California (FJ380118) whereas the 3´ end encodes proteins which share high amino acid sequence identity with RNA1 of Bean yellow disorder virus (BnYDV; EU191904). The genomic sequence of RNA2 consists of 8 ORFs, instead of 10 ORFs contained in LCV-California isolate. The distribution of vsiRNA (virus-derived small interfering RNA) along the LCV-SP genome suggested the presence of subgenomic RNAs corresponding with HSP70, P6.4 and P60. Results of the analysis using RDP4 and Simplot programs are the proof of the evidence that LCV-SP is the first recombinant of the family Closteroviridae by crossover recombination of intact ORFs, being the LCV RNA1 (FJ380118) and BnYDV RNA1 (EU191904) the origin of the new LCV strain. Genetic diversity values of virus isolates in the recombinant region obtained after sampling LCV-SP infected green bean between 2011 and 2017 might suggest that the recombinant virus event occurred in the area before this period. The presence of LCV-SP shows the role of recombination as a driving force of evolution within the genus Crinivirus, a globally distributed, emergent genus.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The evolution of signal transduction pathways is constrained by the requirements of signal fidelity, yet flexibility is necessary to allow pathway remodeling in response to environmental challenges. A detailed understanding of how flexibility and constraint shape bacterial two component signaling systems is emerging, but how new signal transduction architectures arise remains unclear. Here, we investigate pathway remodeling using the Firmicute sporulation initiation (Spo0) pathway as a model. The present-day Spo0 pathways in Bacilli and Clostridia share common ancestry, but possess different architectures. In Clostridium acetobutylicum, sensor kinases directly phosphorylate Spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation. In Bacillus subtilis, Spo0A is activated via a four-protein phosphorelay. The current view favors an ancestral direct phosphorylation architecture, with the phosphorelay emerging in the Bacillar lineage. Our results reject this hypothesis. Our analysis of 84 broadly distributed Firmicute genomes predicts phosphorelays in numerous Clostridia, contrary to the expectation that the Spo0 phosphorelay is unique to Bacilli. Our experimental verification of a functional Spo0 phosphorelay encoded by Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans (Class Clostridia) further supports functional phosphorelays in Clostridia, which strongly suggests that the ancestral Spo0 pathway was a phosphorelay. Cross complementation assays between Bacillar and Clostridial phosphorelays demonstrate conservation of interaction specificity since their divergence over 2.7 BYA. Further, the distribution of direct phosphorylation Spo0 pathways is patchy, suggesting multiple, independent instances of remodeling from phosphorelay to direct phosphorylation. We provide evidence that these transitions are likely the result of changes in sporulation kinase specificity or acquisition of a sensor kinase with specificity for Spo0A, which is remarkably conserved in both architectures. We conclude that flexible encoding of interaction specificity, a phenotype that is only intermittently essential, and the recruitment of kinases to recognize novel environmental signals resulted in a consistent and repeated pattern of remodeling of the Spo0 pathway.'\n",

Eukaryotic genomes encode histones, which are assembled on the genome into octamers, yielding nucleosomes. Post-translational modifications of the histones, which occur mostly on their N-terminal tails, define the functional state of chromatin. Like eukaryotes, most archaeal genomes encode histones, which are believed to be involved in the compaction and organization of their genomes. Instead of discrete multimers, in vivo data suggest assembly of \"nucleosomes\" of variable size, consisting of multiples of dimers, which are able to induce repression of transcription. Based on these data and a model derived from X-ray crystallography, it was recently proposed that archaeal histones assemble on DNA into \"endless\" hypernucleosomes. In this review, we discuss the amino acid determinants of hypernucleosome formation and highlight differences with the canonical eukaryotic octamer. We identify archaeal histones differing from the consensus, which are expected to be unable to assemble into hypernucleosomes. Finally, we identify atypical archaeal histones with short N- or C-terminal extensions and C-terminal tails similar to the tails of eukaryotic histones, which are subject to post-translational modification.

In this study, we present a refined m6A MeRIP-seq protocol and analysis pipeline that can be applied to profile low-input RNA samples from patient tumors.

With the optimized immunoprecipitation (IP) conditions and a postamplification rRNA depletion strategy, we were able to profile the m6A epitranscriptome using 500 ng of total RNA. We identified approximately 12,000 m6A peaks with a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio from 2 lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) patient tumors. Through integrative analysis of the transcriptome, m6A epitranscriptome, and proteome data in the same patient tumors, we identified dynamics at the m6A level that account for the discordance between mRNA and protein levels in these tumors. The refined m6A MeRIP-seq method is suitable for m6A epitranscriptome profiling in a limited amount of patient tumors, setting the ground for unraveling the dynamics of the m6A epitranscriptome and the underlying mechanisms in clinical settings.'\n"

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND The aim of this observational case-control study was to compare the levels of plasma resistin between patients with acute aortic dissection and matched controls, and to use propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce case selection bias and clinical confounders. MATERIAL AND METHODS With the use of PSM, this study included 43 pairs of patients with acute aortic dissection (type-A and type-B dissection) and matched controls. Plasma resistin levels and other laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups, including white blood cell (WBC) count, glucose, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and D-dimer. The correlations between resistin and other laboratory parameters were evaluated in patients with acute aortic dissection. RESULTS Following PSM adjustment for clinical variables, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and stroke, plasma resistin levels were significantly increased in patients with acute aortic dissection when compared with controls (35.2±13.8 vs. 18.4±9.1 ng/ml) (p<0.001). WBC counts, and levels of glucose, hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α and D-dimer were also significantly increased in the patients with aortic dissection compared with the control group. After adjustment for these variables, the association between plasma resistin levels and acute aortic dissection remained significant (OR, 1.114; 95% CI, 1.036-1.224) (p<0.001). Plasma resistin levels was positively correlated with WBC count (r=0.368, p=0.015), hs-CRP (r=0.359, p=0.022), IL-6 (r=0.306, p=0.046) and TNF-α levels (r=0.315, p=0.040) in patients with acute aortic dissection. CONCLUSIONS Acute aortic dissection is associated with elevated levels of plasma resistin and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Plasma resistin levels is positively associated with other pro-inflammatory cytokines in acute aortic dissection.'\n",

      "Abstract :'BACKGROUND: Oral fluid (OF) is increasingly used as an alternative sample matrix in drug of abuse screening. Screening is commonly performed by immunoassays and results confirmed using laborious gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based methods. Therefore, an easy to operate ion trap mass spectrometric (IT-MS) commercial screening method (Toxtyper; Bruker Daltronik, Bremen, Germany) combined with a laboratory-developed sample preparation procedure has been evaluated for their application to OF.\\n\\nMETHODS: OF samples were subjected to protein precipitation followed by HybridSPE-Phospholipid extraction. Chromatographic separation was achieved by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography; MS2/MS3 spectra were recorded by IT-MS and analyzed using a library provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltronik). The lower limit of detection, linearity, imprecision, inaccuracy, and specificity (interferences and matrix effects) were investigated for methadone, buprenorphine, pregabalin, fentanyl, amphetamine, 3,4-methylendioxy-N-methylamphetamine, cocaine, acetylcodeine, and nordiazepam, after spiking drug-free OF with these test substances. In addition, concordance between IT-MS results and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, or immunoassay (buprenorphine) results was investigated.\\n\\nRESULTS: No interferences or matrix effects were observed. The lower limit of detection for acetylcodeine, amphetamine, benzoylecgonine, methadone, and nordiazepam was below the common cutoffs for immunological screening assays and comparable to that of GC-MS. Imprecision and inaccuracy, both in- and between-series, were consistently <25%, except for buprenorphine. Toxtyper screening for pregabalin and fentanyl was less sensitive than a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. A very good concordance was found between the previous analytical approach and the new IT-MS method.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: The Toxtyper IT-MS is easy to use and can be applied for the screening of drug of abuse and the qualitative confirmation analysis in OF in a clinical toxicology service. Although intended for qualitative analysis, performance data suggest that the methods investigated may also be applicable for semiquantitative longitudinal follow-up.'\n",

In this study, it was evaluated the action of copaiba oil on the modulation of proteins involved in RV apoptosis signaling in rats with PAH. Male Wistar rats (±170g, n=7/group) were divided into four groups: control, MCT, copaiba oil, and MCT+copaiba oil. PAH was induced by MCT (60 mg/kg i.p.) and, seven days later, treatment with copaiba oil (400 mg/kg by gavage) was given for 14 days. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements were performed, and the RV was collected for morphometric evaluations, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cell survival signaling, and eNOS protein expression. Copaiba oil reduced RV hypertrophy (24%), improved RV systolic function, and reduced RV end-diastolic pressure, increased total sulfhydryl levels and eNOS protein expression, reduced lipid and protein oxidation, and the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling in the RV of MCT+copaiba oil as compared to MCT group. In conclusion, copaiba oil reduced oxidative stress, and apoptosis signaling in RV of rats with PAH, which may be associated with an improvement in cardiac function caused by this compound.'\n",

However, the association between AZA metabolites and the mucosal state in inflammatory bowel disease is largely unclear.\\n\\nAIMS: We investigated the association between AZA's active metabolite 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and fecal calprotectin (FC) as a well-validated surrogate marker of mucosal inflammation in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) on AZA monotherapy.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 443 6-TGN measurements, 140 values from 88 patients with CD on AZA monotherapy visiting the inflammatory bowel disease outpatient clinic between 2009 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. In a subcohort with serial 6-TGN measurements, longitudinal FC measurements in patients with versus without intervention (dose increase, allopurinol, and education) were assessed.\\n\\nRESULTS: In patients with 6-TGN concentrations within a predefined range (250-450\\u2009pmol/8×10 red blood cells), FC was significantly lower (median: 119.5 vs. 327.2\\u2009mg/kg, P=0.003), and hemoglobin as well as serum protein concentrations were significantly higher than in patients with 6-TGN outside of this range. C-reactive protein and transferrin saturation were not different. In the longitudinal cohort, 6-TGN increased in the intervention group, but only a minority reached the defined range; no significant change in FC was observed.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that in patients with CD receiving AZA monotherapy, 6-TGN concentrations within a defined range (250-450\\u2009pmol/8×10 red blood cells) are associated with significantly lower FC. A treat-to-target concept directed by 6-TGN to reach mucosal healing may thus be a promising approach (DRKS00013246).\"\n",

The optimization of radiolabeling conditions was performed on the basis of such variables as incubation time, reaction temperature, pH, and concentration of peptide and stannous chloride. Moreover, the stability and fibrin-binding affinity of the radiolabeled peptide were measured. The peptide-fibrin interactions were analyzed by docking studies using HEX and Auto dock 4.2.

      "Abstract :'Invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can infiltrate back into and spread along preexisting pancreatic ducts and ductules in a process known as cancerization of ducts (COD). Histologically COD can mimic high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PanIN). We reviewed pancreatic resections from 100 patients with PDAC for the presence or absence of ducts with histologic features of COD. Features supporting COD included adjacent histologically similar invasive PDAC and an abrupt transition between markedly atypical intraductal epithelium and normal duct epithelium or circumferential involvement of a duct. As the TP53 and SMAD4 genes are frequently targeted in invasive PDAC but not HG-PanIN, paired PDAC and histologically suspected COD lesions were immunolabeled with antibodies to the p53 and Smad4 proteins. Suspected COD was identified on hematoxylin and eosin sections in 89 (89%) of the cases. Immunolabeling for p53 and Smad4 was performed in 68 (76%) of 89 cases. p53 was interpretable in 55 cases and all 55 (100%) cases showed concordant labeling between COD and invasive PDAC. There was matched aberrant p53 immunolabeling in 37 (67%) cases including overexpression in 30 (55%) cases and lack of expression in 7 (13%) cases. Smad4 immunolabeling was interpretable in 61 cases and 59 (97%) cases showed concordant labeling between COD and invasive PDAC. Matched loss of Smad4 was seen in 28 (46%) cases. The immunolabeling of invasive PDAC and COD for p53 and Smad4 supports the high prevalence of COD observed on hematoxylin and eosin and highlights the utility of p53 and Smad4 immunolabeling in differentiating COD and HG-PanIN.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

The following parameters were measured: dry matter (DM), crude ash (ASH), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), nitrogen-free extract (NFE; calculated), lactose, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), fatty acids (FAs), and gross energy (GE). DM, ASH, CP, and EE were determined with a proximate analysis, lactose with infrared spectroscopy and an enzymatic method, minerals with an autoanalyzer, FA with gas chromatography, and GE with bomb calorimetry. Milk samples were collected from two Indian rhinoceros cows from Zoo Basel. Rhino A gave birth to her third calf on 10 September 2012; three samples were collected and analyzed (colostrum, milk 1 wk and 2 wk postpartum). Rhino B gave birth to her eighth calf on 05 October 2013; samples were collected and 15 were chosen for the analyses (from colostrum to 13 mo postpartum). The composition of rhino B's colostrum was 13.8% DM (wet-weight basis), 4.8% ASH, 61.8% CP, 0.7% EE, 32.6% NFE, 26.7% lactose, 0.59% Ca, 0.54% P, 0.2% Mg (DM basis), and 20.3 MJ GE/kg DM.

In this study, 3-hydroxybutyrate was measured in plasma samples collected from a cohort of African penguins ( Spheniscus demersus) maintained under human care. Results were interpreted in combination with those of protein electrophoresis and compared with anti- Aspergillus antibody and galactomannan antigen detection. Overall, 3-hydroxybutyrate levels were found significantly increased in Aspergillus-diseased cases versus the control penguin group ( P = 0.002). Mean absolute concentration of β-globulins was increased >20% in samples from infected birds, and α2-globublins were also found to be significantly increased versus clinically normal controls ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.001 respectively). Of note, the α2-globulins were also significantly increased versus penguins with inflammatory (non-aspergillosis) diseases ( P = 0.001). The specificity of 3-hydroxybutyrate, β-globulins, and α2-globulins for aspergillosis was 78.6%, 79.6%, and 92.2%, respectively. Using these measures in tandem resulted in high specificity (>90%) and negative predictive value (≥80%). In contrast, anti- Aspergillus antibody and galactomannan antigen did not distinguish between infected cases and controls ( P > 0.05). This study demonstrates that basic testing in tandem with the new biomarker 3-hydroxybutyrate may provide reliable evidence for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in penguins.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of protein and carbohydrate ingestion during early recovery from exhaustive exercise on performance after 18 h recovery. Eight elite cyclists (VO 74.0±1.6 ml∙kg∙min) completed two exercise and diet interventions in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover design. Participants cycled first at 73% of VO (W73%) followed by one-min intervals at 90% of VO until exhaustion. During the first two hours of recovery, participants ingested either 1.2 g carbohydrate∙kg∙h (CHO) or 0.8 g carbohydrate + 0.4 g protein∙kg∙h (CHO+PROT). The diet during the remaining recovery period was similar for both interventions and adjusted to body weight. After an 18 h recovery, cycling performance was assessed with a 10 s sprint test, 30 min of cycling at W73%, and a cycling time trial (TT). The TT was 8.5% faster (41:53±1:51 min vs 45:26±1:32 min; p&lt;0.03) after CHO+PROT compared to CHO. Mean power output during the sprints was 3.7% higher in CHO-PROT compared to CHO (1063±54 W vs 1026±53 W; p&lt;0.01). Nitrogen balance in the recovery period was negative in CHO and neutral in CHO+PROT (-82.4±11.5 vs 7.0±15.4 mg∙kg; p&lt;0.01).\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION: TT and sprint performances were improved 18 h after exhaustive cycling by CHO-PROT supplementation during the first two hours of recovery compared with isoenergetic CHO supplementation. Our results indicate that intake of carbohydrate plus protein after exhaustive endurance exercise more rapidly converts the body from a catabolic to an anabolic state than carbohydrate alone, thus speeding recovery and improving subsequent cycling performance.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-1. Recently, a multifunctional innate cytokine IL-15 has been implicated in the protection of several diseases including cancer. Tissue fibrosis is one of the major problems to treat successfully chronic pancreatitis pathogenesis. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that rIL-15 treatment may induce innate tissue responses and its over-expression will improve the pathogenesis of cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis, associated remodeling and fibrosis. We observed atrophy of acinar cells, increased inflammation, and increased deposition of perivascular collagen, the up-regulated protein level of TGF-β1, α-SMA, and collagen-1 in cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis in mice. Further, we reported that rIL-15 treatment protects mice from the cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis pathogenesis including acinar cells atrophy, and perivascular accumulation of tissue collagen followed by down-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes such as TGF-β1, α-SMA, Collagen-1, Collagen-3, and Fibronectin in cerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis in mice. Mechanistically, we show that IL-15-mediated increase of IFN-Υ responsive iNKT cells in the blood and tissue protects cerulein-induced pancreatic pathogenesis in mice. Of note, a reduced iNKT cells were also observed in the human chronic pancreatitis compared to the normal individuals. Taken together, these data suggest that IL-15 treatment may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic pancreatitis pathogenesis.'\n"

This study aimed to determine the effect dietary protein:fat ratio manipulation on the gut microbiota and GI barrier function during weight loss at high altitude (HA), and to identify associations between the gut microbiota and host responses to HA. Following sea level (SL) testing, 17 healthy males were transported to HA (4300m) and randomly assigned to consume provided standard-protein (SP; 1.1g/kg/d, 39% fat) or higher-protein (HP; 2.1g/kg/d, 23% fat) carbohydrate-matched hypocaloric diets for 22d. Fecal microbiota composition and metabolites, GI barrier function, GI symptoms, and acute mountain sickness (AMS) severity were measured. Macronutrient intake did not impact fecal microbiota composition, had only transient effects on microbiota metabolites, and had no effect on increases in small intestinal permeability, GI symptoms, and inflammation observed at HA. AMS severity was also unaffected by diet, but in exploratory analyses was associated with higher SL relative abundance of Prevotella, a known driver of inter-individual variability in human gut microbiota composition, and greater microbiota diversity after AMS onset. Findings suggest that the gut microbiota may contribute to variability in host responses to HA independent of the dietary protein:fat ratio, but should be considered preliminary and hypothesis-generating due to the small sample size and exploratory nature of analyses associating the fecal microbiota and host responses to HA.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Synapse formation is mediated by a surprisingly large number and wide variety of genes encoding many different protein classes. One of the families increasingly implicated in synapse wiring is the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). IgSF molecules are by definition any protein containing at least one Ig-like domain, making this family one of the most common protein classes encoded by the genome. Here, we review the emerging roles for IgSF molecules in synapse formation specifically in the vertebrate brain, focusing on examples from three classes of IgSF members: (a) cell adhesion molecules, (b) signaling molecules, and (c) immune molecules expressed in the brain. The critical roles for IgSF members in regulating synapse formation may explain their extensive involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Solving the IgSF code for synapse formation may reveal multiple new targets for rescuing IgSF-mediated deficits in synapse formation and, eventually, new treatments for psychiatric disorders caused by altered IgSF-induced synapse wiring. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genetics Volume 52 is November 23, 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.'\n",

      "Abstract :'The encapsulation of proteins into complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms) is of potential interest for a wide range of applications. To address the stability and dynamic properties of these polyelectrolyte complexes, combinations of cyan, yellow, and blue fluorescent proteins were encapsulated with cationic-neutral diblock copolymer poly(2-methyl-vinyl-pyridinium)- b-poly(ethylene-oxide). Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) allowed us to determine the kinetics of C3M formation and of protein exchange between C3Ms. Both processes follow first-order kinetics with relaxation times of ±100 s at low ionic strength ( I = 2.5 mM). Stability studies revealed that 50% of FRET was lost at I = 20 mM, pointing to the disintegration of the C3Ms. On the basis of experimental and theoretical considerations, we propose that C3Ms relax to their final state by association and dissociation of near-neutral soluble protein-polymer complexes. To obtain protein-containing C3Ms suitable for applications, it is necessary to improve the rigidity and salt stability of these complexes.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR) is the principal regulator of blood pressure in humans. The overactivation of ATR by the stimulation of angiotensin II would result in high blood pressure. To prevent hypertension, nonpeptide \"sartan\" drugs, such as valsartan (VST), have been developed to competitively block the access of angiotensin II to the receptor. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular modeling studies have identified that VST in solution and in lipid micelles (a mimic membrane environment) has two distinct trans/cis conformations (VST/VST) that can be transformed into each other through the isomerization of the amide bond. To date, it is still not known whether the two conformations of VST can affect the binding of ATR with VST. To this end, the binding of ATR with VST or VST was modeled based on the recently determined crystal structures of ATR. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed to study the structural and dynamical differences of ATR caused by the two conformations of VST. Simulation results show that ATR with VST has higher structural and dynamical stabilities compared to that with VST. Binding energy analysis indicates that ATR bind more strongly with VST, and the energy difference mainly results from the contribution of van der Waals and nonpolar interactions. Detailed analyses reveal that unlike ATR with VST, ATR with VST displays an activate-like state, which is characterized by a small outward movement of transmembrane helix 6. Due to the altered interaction with the butyl group of VST, residue Tyr87 undergoes a conformational change that causes a contraction of the pocket for VST binding. The rearrangement of ATR is then propagated to the intracellular side of the receptor through the conformational change of residue Trp253 (the toggle switch), which results in an expansion of the pocket for G protein binding and the breakage of the hydrogen bond containing the conserved residue Arg126. These data provide insights into the activation mechanism of ATR caused by the binding of VST, which may help to design a new drug to inhibit ATR and prevent high blood pressure.'\n",

Rotamer libraries of the covalently attached spin-labels help reduce position uncertainties. Here we show that rotamer reweighting is essential for precision distance measurements, making it possible to resolve Ångstrom-scale domain motions. We analyze extensive DEER measurements on the three N-terminal polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains of the outer membrane protein Omp85. Using the \"Bayesian inference of ensembles\" maximum-entropy method, we extract rotamer weights from the DEER measurements. Small weight changes suffice to eliminate otherwise significant discrepancies between experiments and model and unmask 1-3 Å domain motions relative to the crystal structure. Rotamer-weight refinement is a simple yet powerful tool for precision distance measurements that should be broadly applicable to label-based measurements including DEER, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).'\n"

      "Abstract :'High-potential iron-sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) are an important class of metalloproteins with a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by four cysteine residues. Distinct from other iron-sulfur proteins, the cluster in HiPIP has a high reduction potential, making it an essential electron carrier in bacterial photosynthesis. Here, we combined single-molecule atomic force microscopy and protein engineering techniques to investigate the mechanical unfolding mechanism of HiPIP from Chromatium tepidum (cHiPIP). We found that cHiPIP unfolds in a two-step fashion with the protein sequence sequestered by the iron-sulfur center as a stable unfolding intermediate state. The rupture of the iron-sulfur center of cHiPIP proceeds in two distinct parallel pathways; one pathway involves the concurrent rupture of multiple iron-thiolate bonds, and the other one involves the sequential rupture of the iron-thiolate bonds. This mechanistic information was further confirmed by mutational studies. We found that the rupture of the iron-thiolate bonds in reduced and oxidized cHiPIP occurred in the range of 150-180 pN at a pulling speed of 400 nm/s, similar to that measured for iron-thiolate bonds in rubredoxin and ferredoxin. Our results may have important implications for understanding the general unfolding mechanism governing iron-sulfur proteins, as well as the mechanism governing the mechanical rupture of the iron-sulfur center.'\n",

For the majority of protein-protein interactions identified, however, there is no information on the structure of the complex or the interface involved in the interaction. Understanding what surface properties drive certain interactions is crucial in the functional evaluation of protein complexes. Here we show that the local patterning of the physicochemical properties of amino acids within surface patches is characteristic of interfaces. To describe this feature in a quantitative manner, we have defined a statistical potential, iPat, as a measure of surface patterning. iPat, which does not take evolutionary conservation or knowledge of the interaction partner into consideration, represents a function principally different from algorithms that consider intermolecular contacts. We assess its suitability for characterizing protein and peptide interfaces, and we demonstrate that iPat is uniquely descriptive for interfaces of proteins that undergo large conformational changes or that are involved in the binding of intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) partners. We suggest that as a stand-alone propensity or in combination with other features, iPat represents a new feature in analyzing the functional binding specificity of protein-protein interactions that has better predictive potential than other simple 1D features, such as hydrophobicity or stickiness.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Taurine is a non-proteinogenic ß-aminosulfonic acid. Important dietary sources of taurine are fish and seafood. Taurine interacts with ion channels, stabilizes membranes and regulates the cell volume. These actions confirm its high concentrations in excitable tissues like retina, neurons and muscles. Retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy as well as skeletal muscle malfunction are evident in taurin e deficient phenotypes. There is evidence that taurine counteracts lipid peroxidation and increases cellular antioxidant defense in response to inflammation. In activated neutrophils taurine reacts with hypochloric acid to taurine chloramine (TauCl), which triggers the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Keap1-Nrf2) pathway. Consequently, Nrf2 target genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and catalase (CAT) are induced. Furthermore taurine may prevent an overload of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly by an inhibition of ROS generation within the respiratory chain. Taurine affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and taurine deficient mice exhibit an impaired exercise performance. Moreover, some studies demonstrate that taurine enhances the glycogen repletion in the post-exercise recovery phase. In the case of taurine deficiency, many studies observed a phenotype known in muscle senescence and skeletal muscle disorders. Overall, taurine plays an important role in cellular redox homeostasis and skeletal muscle function. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'\n",

Although a large number of MSC can be propagated from a small initial sample, several lines of evidence indicate that MSC lose their immunosuppressive and regenerative potency aftaer multiple passages. In this report, we use the FACSCAP Lyoplate proteomic analysis system to detect changes in cell surface protein expression of CD45 /CD31 /CD34 /CD73 /CD105 stromal cells in unpassaged bone marrow (BM) and through 10 serial culture passages. We provide for the first time a detailed characterization of native unpassaged BM MSC (0.08% of BM mononuclear cells) as well as the changes that occur during the initial expansion. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiative potential was determined though the serial passages and correlated with immunophenotypic changes and senescence. Among the most prominent were striking decreases in Fas ligand, CD98, CD205, and CD106, accompanied by a gain in the expression of CD49c, CD63, CD98, and class 1 and class 2 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Other molecules that are down-modulated with later passage include CD24, CD54, CD59, CD243/P-glycoprotein, and CD273/PD-L2. Early senescence, as defined by the loss of replicative capacity occurring with the loss of differentiative capacity, increase in CDKN2A p16, and increased time to confluence, was accompanied by loss of the motility-associated metalloproteinase CD10 and the proliferation-associated transferrin receptor CD71. Among the strongest statistical associations were loss of MAC-inhibitory protein/CD59, loss of ICAM-1/CD54, and increase in CDKN2A as a function of increasing passage, as well as increased CD10 expression with adipogenic and osteogenic capacities. The data provide a clear set of markers that can be used to assess MSC quality. We suggest that clinically relevant numbers of highly functional low passage MSC can be manufactured starting with large quantities of BM, which are readily available from cadaveric organ donors.'\n"

A temperature sensitivity test demonstrated that absence of the Sra or RimJ protein did not change the temperature sensitivity of the dnaA46, dnaB252, or dnaC2 mutants. Moreover, ectopic expression of Sra reversed the mutant phenotype while cells carrying the pACYC177-rimJ plasmid did not reverse the rimJ mutant phenotype. The results indicate that deletion of sra or rimJ cause defects in ribosomal function and affect the translation process, leading to a decrease in synthesis of proteins including DnaA.

There is increasing evidence suggesting that treatment failure may be classified as mechanistic, pharmacokinetic, or immune-mediated. Data regarding the contribution of these factors in children with IBD treated with infliximab (IFX) are still incomplete. The aim was to assess the causes of treatment failure in a prospective cohort of pediatric patients treated with IFX.\\n\\nMETHODS: This observational study considered 49 pediatric (median age 14.4) IBD patients (34 Crohn's disease, 15 ulcerative colitis) treated with IFX. Serum samples were collected at 6, 14, 22 and 54 weeks, before IFX infusions. IFX and anti-infliximab antibodies (AIA) were measured using ELISA assays. Disease activity was determined by PCDAI or PUCAI.\\n\\nRESULTS: Clinical remission, defined as a clinical score <10, was obtained by 76.3% of patients at week 14 and by 73.9% at week 54.

A perforation model of SAH was introduced into the study. Recombinant human MANF (rh-MANF) and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor (MK2206) were used to explore the effect and the mechanisms. Multiple approaches for systemic assessment were employed in the research, including the Garcia test, the SAH grade, Evans blue (EB) dye leakage, brain-water content (BWC), the rotarod test, and the Morris water-navigation task, as were biotechniques, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. MANF was mainly expressed in rat neurons, and its expression increased significantly at 3 h after SAH induction and peaked at 24 h. Stereotactic injection of rh-MANF into the cerebroventricle significantly increased the level of MANF, p-Akt, p-mouse double minute 2 homolog (p-MDM2), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in brain tissue, whereas it down-regulated the expression of P53, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3, which indicated that neuronal apoptosis was remarkably suppressed. Expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was also suppressed by the rh-MANF injection. Furthermore, neurologic deficits, EB dye leakage, and BWC were reduced, and long-lasting neuroprotection was noted with rh-MANF administration. The antiapoptotic and blood-brain barrier (BBB) protective effect could be offset by administering MK2206. MANF could alleviate neuronal apoptosis by activating Akt-dependent prosurvival pathway and abate BBB damage via MMP-9 suppression. MANF showed not only transient but also long-lasting neuroprotective properties.

Recent structural analysis and coupled mass spectrometry studies have shown that the Escherichia coli ammonium transporter AmtB specifically binds 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). Upon POPG binding, several residues of AmtB undergo a small conformational change, which stabilizes the protein against unfolding. However, no studies have so far been conducted, to our knowledge, to explore whether POPG binding to AmtB has functional consequences. Here, we used an in vitro experimental assay with purified components, together with molecular dynamics simulations, to characterize the relation between POPG binding and AmtB activity. We show that the AmtB activity is electrogenic. Our results indicate that the activity, at the molecular level, of Amt in archaebacteria and eubacteria may differ. We also show that POPG is an important cofactor for AmtB activity and that, in the absence of POPG, AmtB cannot complete the full translocation cycle. Furthermore, our simulations reveal previously undiscovered POPG binding sites on the intracellular side of the lipid bilayer between the AmtB subunits. Possible molecular mechanisms explaining the functional role of POPG are discussed.-Mirandela, G. D., Tamburrino, G., Hoskisson, P. A., Zachariae, U., Javelle, A.

As we age, many components of pulmonary innate immunity are impaired, including slowing of mucociliary clearance. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is a major determinant of mucociliary clearance, and it slows as we age. We hypothesized that CBF is slowed in aging due to increased oxidative stress, which activates PKCε signaling. We pharmacologically inhibited PKCε in ex vivo mouse models of aging. We measured a slowing of CBF with aging that was reversed with inhibition using the novel PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, as well as the PKCε inhibitor, PKCe141. Inhibition of PKCε using siRNA in mouse trachea also returned CBF to normal. In addition, antioxidants decrease PKCε activity and speed cilia. We also aged wild type and PKCε KO mice and measured CBF. The PKCε KO mice were spared from the CBF slowing of aging. Using human airway epithelial cells from younger and older donors at air-liquid interface (ALI), and used siRNA to inhibit PKCε. We measured a slowing of CBF with aging that was reversed with siRNA inhibition of PKCε. In addition, we measured bead clearance speeds in human ALI, which demonstrated a decrease in bead velocity with aging and a return to baseline after inhibition of PKCε.

      "Abstract :'Differentiation of primary alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC type II) to AEC type I in culture is a major barrier in the study of the alveolar epithelium in vitro. The establishment of an AEC type II cell line derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) represents a novel opportunity to study alveolar epithelial cell biology, for instance in the context of lung injury, fibrosis and repair. In the present study, we generated long lasting AECII from iPSC (iPSC-AEC). Long lasting iPSC-AECII (LL)-iPSC-AECII) displayed morphological characteristics of AECII including growth in a cobble stone monolayer, the presence of lamellar bodies and microvilli as shown by electron microscopy. Also, (LL)-iPSC-AECII expressed AEC type II proteins such as cytokeratin, surfactant protein C and lysotracker DND 26 (a marker for lamellar bodies). Furthermore, the (LL)-iPSC-AECII exhibited functional properties of AECII by an increase of transepithelial electrical resistance (TERR) over time, secretion of inflammatory mediators in biologically relevant quantities (interleukin-6, interleukin-8) and efficient in vitro alveolar epithelial wound repair. Consistent with the AECII phenotype, the cell line showed the ability to uptake and release surfactant protein B, to secrete phospholipids and to differentiate into AEC type I. In summary, we established a long lasting, but finite AEC type II cell line derived from iPSC as a novel cellular model to study alveolar epithelial cell biology in lung health and disease.'\n"

      "Abstract :'OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with strongyle infection and parasite reduction strategies associated with low strongyle fecal egg counts (FECs) in goats on farms in North Carolina. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 631 adult goats on 52 farms in North Carolina. PROCEDURES Participating farms were visited to collect fecal samples from goats and administer a survey regarding goat, environmental, and management factors. The McMaster technique was used to determine strongyle FEC for each sample. Univariate followed by multivariate modeling was performed to identify factors associated with FEC at the farm and individual goat level. RESULTS Multivariate analysis controlling for several other factors and multiple comparisons revealed that farms on which no anthelmintic drugs had ever been used had the lowest mean FECs, compared with farms on which specific strategies for parasite control were used; no other variables were significant. For individual goat FEC, significant variables included goat breed, breed type, owner-defined purpose, daily dietary protein intake, and fecal coccidia score. In particular, companion goats (vs meat or dairy goats) had the lowest FECs. Higher dietary protein intake and coccidia scores were associated with higher FECs. Among females, goats that had kidded in the last 6 weeks had the highest FECs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Various factors were identified that appeared to influence the likelihood of strongyle infection in goats. The finding that farms with no history of anthelmintic use had the lowest mean FECs suggested that a focus on preventative measures could reduce the need for anthelmintic drugs and, by extension, lessen the opportunity for the development of anthelmintic resistance.'\n",

      "Abstract :'In this extra view, we comment on our recent work concerning the mRNA localization of the gene slow as molasses (slam). slam is a gene essential for the polarized invagination of the plasma membrane and separation of basal and lateral cortical domains during cellularization as well as for germ cell migration in later embryogenesis. We have demonstrated an intimate relationship between slam RNA and its encoded protein. Slam RNA co-localizes and forms a complex with its encoded protein. Slam mRNA localization not only is required for reaching full levels of functional Slam protein but also depends on Slam protein. The translation of slam mRNA is subject to tight spatio-temporal regulation leading to a rapid accumulation of Slam protein and zygotic slam RNA at the furrow canal. In this extra view, we first discuss the mechanism controlling localization and translation of slam RNA. In addition, we document in detail the maternal and zygotic expression of slam RNA and protein and provide data for a function in membrane stabilization. Furthermore, we mapped the region of Slam protein mediating cortical localization in cultured cells.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin that binds specifically to the tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor, has been shown to promote neuronal differentiation, maturation, and synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) during development or after injury and onset of disease. Unfortunately, native BDNF protein-based therapies have had little clinical success due to their suboptimal pharmacological properties. In the past 20 years, BDNF mimetic peptides have been designed with the purpose of activating certain cell pathways that mimic the functional activity of native BDNF, but the interaction of mimetic peptides with cells can be limited due to the conformational specificity required for receptor activation. We report here on the incorporation of a BDNF mimetic sequence into a supramolecular peptide amphiphile filamentous nanostructure capable of activating the BDNF receptor TrkB and downstream signaling in primary cortical neurons in vitro. Interestingly, we found that this BDNF mimetic peptide is only active when displayed on a peptide amphiphile supramolecular nanostructure. We confirmed that increased neuronal maturation is linked to TrkB signaling pathways by analyzing the phosphorylation of downstream signaling effectors and tracking electrical activity over time. Furthermore, three-dimensional gels containing the BDNF peptide amphiphile (PA) nanostructures encourage cell infiltration while increasing functional maturation. Our findings suggest that the BDNF mimetic PA nanostructure creates a highly bioactive matrix that could serve as a biomaterial therapy in injured regions of the CNS. This new strategy has the potential to induce endogenous cell infiltration and promote functional neuronal maturation through the presentation of the BDNF mimetic signal.'\n",

However, much like siRNA therapy the majority of progress in mRNA delivery has been confined to the liver. Previously, we demonstrated that poly(β-amino esters), a class of degradable polymers, are capable of systemic mRNA delivery to the lungs in mice when formulated into nanoparticles with poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid conjugates. Using experimental design, a statistical approach to optimization that reduces experimental burden, we demonstrate herein that these degradable polymer-lipid nanoparticles can be optimized in terms of polymer synthesis and nanoparticle formulation to achieve a multiple order-of-magnitude increase in potency. Furthermore, using genetically engineered Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that mRNA is functionally delivered to both the lung endothelium and pulmonary immune cells, expanding the potential utility of these nanoparticles.'\n",

      "Abstract :'Nanometer-range distances are important for restraining the three-dimensional structure and oligomeric assembly of proteins and other biological molecules. Solid-state NMR determination of protein structures typically utilizes C-C and C-N distance restraints, which can only be measured up to ∼7 Å because of the low gyromagnetic ratios of these nuclear spins. To extend the distance reach of NMR, one can harvest the power of F, whose large gyromagnetic ratio in principle allows distances up to 2 nm to be measured. However, F possesses large chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs) as well as large isotropic chemical shift dispersions, which pose challenges to dipolar coupling measurements. Here, we demonstrate F-F distance measurements at high magnetic fields under fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) using radiofrequency-driven dipolar recoupling (RFDR). We show that F-F cross-peaks for distances up to 1 nm can be readily observed in two-dimensional F-F correlation spectra using less than 5 ms of RFDR mixing. This efficient F-F dipolar recoupling is achieved using practically accessible MAS frequencies of 15-55 kHz, moderate F radio frequency field strengths, and no H decoupling. Experiments and simulations show that the fastest polarization transfer for aromatic fluorines with the highest distance accuracy is achieved using either fast MAS (e.g., 60 kHz) with large pulse duty cycles (>50%) or slow MAS with strong F pulses. Fast MAS considerably reduces relaxation losses during the RFDR π-pulse train, making finite-pulse RFDR under fast-MAS the method of choice. Under intermediate MAS frequencies (25-40 kHz) and intermediate pulse duty cycles (15-30%), the F CSA tensor orientation has a quantifiable effect on the polarization transfer rate; thus, the RFDR buildup curves encode both distance and orientation information. At fast MAS, the impact of CSA orientation is minimized, allowing pure distance restraints to be extracted. We further investigate how relayed transfer and dipolar truncation in multifluorine environments affect polarization transfer. This fast-MAS F RFDR approach is complementary to F spin diffusion for distance measurements and will be the method of choice under high-field fast-MAS conditions that are increasingly important for protein structure determination by solid-state NMR.'\n"

      "Abstract :'Eukaryotic translation initiation is a multistep process requiring a number of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). Two GTPases play key roles in the process. eIF2 brings the initiator Met-tRNA to the preinitiation complex (PIC). Upon start codon selection and GTP hydrolysis promoted by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF5, eIF2-GDP is displaced from Met-tRNA by eIF5B-GTP and is released in complex with eIF5. eIF5B promotes ribosomal subunit joining, with the help of eIF1A. Upon subunit joining, eIF5B hydrolyzes GTP and is released together with eIF1A. We found that human eIF5 interacts with eIF5B and may help recruit eIF5B to the PIC. An eIF5B-binding motif was identified at the C-terminus of eIF5, similar to that found in eIF1A. Indeed, eIF5 competes with eIF1A for binding and has an ∼100-fold higher affinity for eIF5B. Because eIF5 is the GAP of eIF2, the newly discovered interaction offers a possible mechanism for coordination between the two steps in translation initiation controlled by GTPases: start codon selection and ribosomal subunit joining. Our results indicate that in humans, eIF5B displacing eIF2 from Met-tRNA upon subunit joining may be coupled to eIF1A displacing eIF5 from eIF5B, allowing the eIF5:eIF2-GDP complex to leave the ribosome.'\n",

      "Abstract :\"The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) play a wide variety of roles in cellular signaling processes, dictating important, and even divergent, cellular fates. These essential kinases possess docking surfaces distal to their active sites that interact with diverse binding partners, including upstream activators, downstream substrates, and protein scaffolds. Prior studies have suggested that the interactions of certain protein-binding partners with one such JNK docking surface, termed the D-recruitment site (DRS), can allosterically influence the conformational state of the ATP-binding pocket of JNKs. To further explore the allosteric relationship between the ATP-binding pockets and DRSs of JNKs, we investigated how the interactions of the scaffolding protein JIP1, as well as the upstream activators MKK4 and MKK7, are allosterically influenced by the ATP-binding site occupancy of the JNKs. We show that the affinity of the JNKs for JIP1 can be divergently modulated with ATP-competitive inhibitors, with a >50-fold difference in dissociation constant observed between the lowest- and highest-affinity JNK1-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, we found that we could promote or attenuate phosphorylation of JNK1's activation loop by MKK4 and MKK7, by varying the ATP-binding site occupancy. Given that JIP1, MKK4, and MKK7 all interact with JNK DRSs, these results demonstrate that there is functional allostery between the ATP-binding sites and DRSs of these kinases. Furthermore, our studies suggest that ATP-competitive inhibitors can allosterically influence the intracellular binding partners of the JNKs.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'In this work, we introduce an asymmetric membrane as a simple and robust nanofluidic platform for digital detection of single pathogenic bacteria directly in 10 mL of unprocessed environmental water samples. The asymmetric membrane, consisting of uniform micropores on one side and a high density of vertically aligned nanochannels on the other side, was prepared within 1 min by a facile method. The single membrane covers all the processing steps from sample concentration, purification, and partition to final digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). By simple filtration, bacteria were enriched and partitioned inside the micropores, while inhibitors typically found in the environmental samples ( i.e., proteins, heavy metals, and organics) were washed away through the nanochannels. Meanwhile, large particles, indigenous plankton, and positively charged pollutants in the samples were excluded by using a sacrificial membrane stacked on top. After initial filtration, modified LAMP reagents, including NaF and lysozyme, were loaded onto the membrane. Each pore in the asymmetric membrane functioned as an individual nanoreactor for selective, rapid, and efficient isothermal amplification of single bacteria, generating a bright fluorescence for direct counting. Even though high levels of inhibitors were present, absolute quantification of Escherichia coli and Salmonella directly in an unprocessed environmental sample (seawater and pond water) was achieved within 1 h, with sensitivity down to single cell and a dynamic range of 0.3-10000 cells/mL. The simple and low-cost analysis platform described herein has an enormous potential for the detection of pathogens, exosomes, stem cells, and viruses as well as single-cell heterogeneity analysis in environmental, food, and clinical research.'\n",

It has been proposed that ribosomes are dynamic complexes capable of changing their protein composition in response to enviromental stimuli. We applied mass spectrometry to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes in response to different environmental stimuli. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that the paralog yeast ribosomal proteins RPL8A (eL8A) and RPL8B (eL8B) change their relative proportions in the 80S ribosome when yeast is switched from growth in glucose to glycerol. Using yeast genetics and polysome profiling, we show that yeast ribosomes containing either RPL8A or RPL8B are not functionally interchangeable. Our quantitative proteomic data support the hypothesis that ribosomes are dynamic complexes that alter their composition and functional activity in response to changes in growth or environmental conditions.

      "Abstract :\"The alteration of intestinal mucosal barrier is considered to be the central pathophysiological process in response to gastrointestinal infections, and mucosal microstructural damage is a major factor for enhancing epithelial permeability in persistent bacterial infections. However, the mechanism involved in hyperpermeability in the early stage of acute bacterial infections is not fully understood. In the present study, fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran across and transepithelial resistance measured in Ussing chambers were used to assess the intestinal paracellular permeability. Mast cell activation was evaluated by western blotting for the presence of tryptase released from mast cells. Serum levels of interleukin-6 were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicated that mast cells played a pivotal role in colonic mucosal hyperpermeability in wild type mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 2 h. And the effect of LPS was mainly dependent on mast cell degranulation, while no change in permeability was observed in the mast cell-deficient mice (Wads⁻/⁻) after LPS administration. No obvious changes of the mucosal structure including histomorphological architecture and expression of intercellular junction proteins were obtained in either wild type or Wads⁻/⁻18 mice after LPS stimulation by hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Furthermore, the self-renewal of intestinal epithelia, detected by using proliferation marker 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, was not involved in increased permeability. Collectively, activation of mast cells induced by LPS mediated intestinal hyperpermeability in the initial stage, and played a crucial role in barrier dysfunction rather than mucosal microstructural damage in acute enterogenous bacterial infection.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"The objective of omics studies is to globally measure the different classes of cellular biomolecules present in a biological specimen (e.g. proteins, metabolites) as accurately as possible in order to investigate the corresponding 'states' of biological systems. High throughput omics technologies are emerging as an increasingly powerful toolkit in the rapidly advancing field of systems biology, enabling the systematic study of dynamic molecular processes that drive core cell functions like growth, sensing, and environmental adaptation. Advances in high resolution mass spectrometry, in particular, now allow for the near comprehensive study of cellular proteins and metabolites that underlie physiological homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Yet while the expression levels, modification states, and functional associations of diverse molecular species are now measurable, existing proteomic and metabolomic data generation and analysis workflows are often specialized and incompatible. Hence, while there are now many reports of ad hoc combinations of unimolecular proteomic and metabolomic workflows, only a limited number of multi-omic profiling approaches have been reported for obtaining different molecular measurements (proteins, metabolites, nucleic acids) in parallel from a single biological sample. Moreover, elucidating how the myriad of measured cellular components are linked together functionally within the metabolic processes, signal transduction pathways, and macromolecular interaction networks central to living systems remains a massive, complicated, and uncertain endeavor. Presented here is a review of convergent mass spectrometry-based multi-omic methodologies, with a focus on notable recent advances and remaining challenges in terms of efficient sample preparation, biochemical separations, data acquisition, and integrative computational strategies. We outline a unifying network-based integrative framework to better derive biological knowledge from integrated profiling studies with the goal of realizing the full potential of multi-omic data sets.\"\n"

In the present study, the effect of Cd on the cell cycle progression of hepatocytes and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Our results showed that Cd inhibited the growth and proliferation of L02 hepatocytes. Further study revealed that Cd significantly induced G2-phase cell cycle arrest accompanied by an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cd-induced G2-phase arrest could be prevented by inhibiting ROS with the use of antioxidant Trolox. Additionally, treatment with Cd induced an increase in the expression of miR-133b, which could be reversed with Trolox pretreatment. Moreover, miR-133b was shown to regulate PPP2R2D expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PPP2R2D mRNA. We also found that treatment with Cd decreased the expression of PPP2R2D, and inhibition of PPP2R2D expression by siRNA partially aggravated Cd-induced cell cycle arrest. By artificially increasing the expression of the protein phosphatase 2A-B55δ subunit (PP2A-B55δ, encoded by the PPP2R2D gene), we confirmed that PPP2R2D can be regulated by miR-133b in Cd-treated cells, and the G2-phase arrest effect could be suppressed by PP2A-B55δ. Collectively, these findings indicated that Cd increased ROS and induced the expression of miR-133b, which consequently inhibited the expression of PPP2R2D and led to G2-phase arrest in L02 hepatocytes. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced cell cycle arrest.\"\n",

      "Abstract :\"Recently, it has been reported that anti-cancer drug bexarotene can remarkably destroy amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in mouse models suggesting therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of bexarotene on clearance of plaques has not been seen in some mouse models. One of the possible mechanisms explaining this phenomenon is that bexarotene levels up expression of apolipoprotein 4 (ApoE4) leading to intracellular clearance of Aβ peptide. Therefore, an interesting question emerges of whether bexarotene can destroy Aβ plaques by direct interaction with them or by preventing production of Aβ peptides. In our previous work we have shown that bexarotene cannot clear amyloid aggregates due to their weak interaction using in silico and in vitro experiments. Here we explore the possibility of inhibiting Aβ production through bexarotene binding to β-secretase which can cleave Aβ peptides from amyloid precursor protein. Using the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method and all-atom simulations we have shown that bexarotene has a very low binding affinity to β-secretase. This result has been also confirmed by our in vitro experiment implying that bexarotene cannot clear amyloid plaques through inhibition of Aβ production. We have also shown that bexarotene tightly binds to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Thus, our result does not contradict the hypothesis that the reduction of Aβ plaques occurs due to bexarotene-induced overexpression of ApoE4.\"\n",

      "Abstract :'Mitogen activated protein kinase-interacting kinase (MNK)-mediated phosphorylation of the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E controls the translation of a subset of mRNAs that are involved in neuronal and immune plasticity. MNK-eIF4E signaling plays a crucial role in the response of nociceptors to injury and/or inflammatory mediators. This signaling pathway controls changes in excitability that drive acute pain sensitization as well as the translation of mRNAs, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), that enhance plasticity between dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors and second order neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. However, since MNK-eIF4E signaling also regulates immune responses, we sought to assess whether decreased pain responses are coupled to decreased inflammatory responses in mice lacking MNK-eIF4E signaling. Our results show that while inflammation resolves more quickly in mice lacking MNK-eIF4E signaling, peak inflammatory responses measured with infrared imaging are not altered in the absence of this signaling pathway even though pain responses are significantly decreased. We also find that inflammation fails to produce hyperalgesic priming, a model for the transition to a chronic pain state, in mice lacking MNK-eIF4E signaling. We conclude that MNK-eIF4E signaling is a critical signaling pathway for the generation of nociceptive plasticity leading to acute pain responses to inflammation and the development of hyperalgesic priming.'\n"
