ABCC10,30211214,"'Background: Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) show the highest degree of heritability in human neoplasms. However, despite the wide number of alterations until now reported in PCCs, it is likely that other susceptibility genes remain still unknown, especially for those PCCs not clearly syndromic.\n\nMethods: Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA was performed on a set of twelve PCCs clinically defined as sporadic.\n\nResults: About 50% of PCCs examined had somatic mutations on the known susceptibility , , and  genes. In addition to these driver events, mutations on , , and  genes were also detected. Moreover, extremely rare germline variants were present in half of the sporadic PCC samples analyzed, in particular variants of  and  were detected in the germline of cases wild-type for mutations in the known susceptibility genes.\n\nConclusions: Additional somatic passenger mutations can be associated with known susceptibility , , and  genes in PCCs, and a wide number of germline variants with still unknown clinical significance can be detected in these patients.Therefore, many efforts should be aimed to better define the pathogenetic role of all these germline variants for discovering novel potential therapeutic targets for this disease still orphan of effective treatments.'"
ABCC10,30032850,"'OBJECTIVES: Although the primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, a considerable proportion of all lung cancers occur in never smokers. Gender influences the risk and characteristics of lung cancer and women are overrepresented among never smokers with the disease. Young age at onset and lack of established environmental risk factors suggest genetic predisposition. In this study, we used population-based sampling of young patients to discover candidate predisposition variants for lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking women.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed archival normal tissue material from 21 never-smoker women who had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma before the age of 45, and exome sequenced their germline DNA.\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Potentially pathogenic variants were found in eight Cancer Gene Census germline genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ERCC4, EXT1, HNF1\u202fA, PTCH1, SMARCB1 and TP53. The variants in TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 are likely to have contributed to the early onset lung cancer in the respective patients (3/21 or 14%). This supports the notion that lung adenocarcinoma can be a component of certain cancer predisposition syndromes. Fifteen genes displayed potentially pathogenic mutations in at least two patients: ABCC10, ATP7B, CACNA1S, CFTR, CLIP4, COL6A1, COL6A6, GCN1, GJB6, RYR1, SCN7A, SEC24A, SP100, TTN and USH2A. Four patients showed a mutation in COL6A1, three in CLIP4 and two in the rest of the genes. Some of these candidate genes may explain a subset of female lung adenocarcinoma.'"
ABCC10,29486476,"'BACKGROUND/AIMS: The overexpression of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters has known to be one of the major obstacles impeding the success of chemotherapy in drug resistant cancers. In this study, we evaluated voruciclib, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, for its chemo-sensitizing activity in ABCB1- and ABCG2- overexpressing cells.\n\nMETHODS: Cytotoxicity and reversal effect of voruciclib was determined by MTT assay. The intracellular accumulation and efflux of ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates were measured by scintillation counter. The effects on expression and intracellular localization of ABCB1 and ABCG2 proteins were determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase assay was done to determine the effect of voruciclib on the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Flow cytometric analysis was done to determine the effect of voruciclib on apoptosis of ABCB1 and ABCG2-overexpressing cells and docking analysis was done to determine the interaction of voruciclib with ABCB1 and ACBG2 protein.\n\nRESULTS: Voruciclib significantly potentiated the effect of paclitaxel and doxorubicin in ABCB1-overexpressing cells, as well as mitoxantrone and SN-38 in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Voruciclib moderately sensitized ABCC10- overexpressing cells to paclitaxel, whereas it did not alter the cytotoxicity of substrates of ABCC1. Furthermore, voruciclib increased the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of substrate anti-cancer drugs from ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. However, voruciclib did not alter the expression or the sub-cellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Voruciclib stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Lastly, voruciclib exhibited a drug-induced apoptotic effect in ABCB1- or ABCG2- overexpressing cells.\n\nCONCLUSION: Voruciclib is currently a phase I clinical trial drug. Our findings strongly support its potential use in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs for cancer chemotherapy.'"
ABCC10,29082457,"'Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy is the major barrier to treating high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa). To improve HGS-OvCa patient prognosis, it is critical to identify the underlying mechanisms that promote platinum resistance. The goal of the present study was to identify a lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and key lncRNAs that predict resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. By systematically analyzing the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in HGS-OvCa samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we revealed that lncRNAs play important roles in platinum resistance in HGS-OvCa patients and delineate a lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network in HGS-OvCa patients who exhibit platinum resistance. Within the platinum resistance-specific lncRNA-mRNA network, 35 lncRNAs and 270 mRNAs showed 124 significant lncRNA-mRNA co-expression relationships. Pathway analysis revealed that lncRNAs in the platinum resistance network may participate in platinum resistance by regulating metabolic pathways. Moreover, HGS-OvCa patients with low lncRNA RP5-1120P11.1 expression showed a poorer prognosis than those with high lncRNA RP5-1120P11.1 expression in TCGA dataset (P\xa0=\xa02.74\xa0×\xa010, log rank test), which was also validated in the GSE63885 dataset (P\xa0=\xa00.0242, log rank test). Network and function analysis revealed that lncRNA RP5-1120P11.1 regulates many cancer-related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (P\xa0=\xa01.02\xa0×\xa010, hypergeometric test) and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway (P\xa0=\xa01.71\xa0×\xa010, hypergeometric test). Particularly, lncRNA RP5-1120P11.1 expression is significantly positively correlated with ABCC10 gene expression (P\xa0=\xa03.89\xa0×\xa010, Pearson correlation test). Both lncRNA RP5-1120P11.1 and ABCC10 were down-regulated in platinum-resistant HGS-OvCa patients, and RP5-1120P11.1 is located near ABCC10 on chromosome 6. Gene ABCC10 has been implicated in resistance to docetaxel treatment. The present study paves the way for investigating lncRNA functions in platinum drug resistance and identifying lncRNAs with prognostic and therapeutic potential in HGS-OvCa.'"
ABCC10,28851502,"'Resistance to conventional and target specific antitumor drugs still remains one of the major cause of treatment failure and patience death. This condition often involves ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that, by pumping the drugs outside from cancer cells, attenuate the potency of chemotherapeutics and negatively impact on the fate of anticancer therapy. In recent years, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib) have been reported to interact with ABC transporters (e.g., ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCG2, ABCC10). This finding disclosed a very complex scenario in which TKIs may behave as substrates or inhibitors depending on the expression of specific pumps, drug concentration, affinity for transporters and types of co-administered agents. In this context, in-depth investigation on TKI chemosensitizing functions might provide a strong rationale for combining TKIs and conventional therapeutics in specific malignancies. The reposition of TKIs as antagonists of ABC transporters opens a new way towards anticancer therapy and clinical strategies aimed at counteracting drug resistance. This review will focus on some paradigmatic examples of the complex and not yet fully elucidated interaction between clinical available TKIs (e.g. BCR-ABL, EGFR, VEGFR inhibitors) with the main ABC transporters implicated in multidrug resistance.'"
ABCC10,28620450,"'Genomic aberrations and gene expression-defined subtypes in the large METABRIC patient cohort have been used to stratify and predict survival. The present study used normalized gene expression signatures of paclitaxel drug response to predict outcome for different survival times in METABRIC patients receiving hormone (HT) and, in some cases, chemotherapy (CT) agents. This machine learning method, which distinguishes sensitivity vs. resistance in breast cancer cell lines and validates predictions in patients; was also used to derive gene signatures of other HT \xa0(tamoxifen) and CT agents (methotrexate, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil) used in METABRIC. Paclitaxel gene signatures exhibited the best performance, however the other agents also predicted survival with acceptable accuracies. A support vector machine (SVM) model of paclitaxel response containing genes\xa0  and \xa0was 78.6% accurate in predicting survival of 84 patients treated with both HT and CT (median survival ≥ 4.4 yr). Accuracy was lower (73.4%) in 304 untreated patients. The performance of other machine learning approaches was also evaluated at different survival thresholds. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection of a paclitaxel-based SVM classifier based on expression of genes\xa0 and\xa0 was 81.1% accurate in 53 CT patients. In addition, a random forest (RF) classifier using a gene signature ( and ) predicted >3-year survival with 85.5% accuracy in 420 HT patients. A similar RF gene signature showed 82.7% accuracy in 504 patients treated with CT and/or HT. These results suggest that tumor gene expression signatures refined by machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting survival after drug therapies.'"
ABCC10,28612064,"'ABCC10 (MRP7) plays a role in cellular detoxification and resistance to anticancer drugs. Since ABCC10 gene transcription in human prostate cancer CWR22Rv1 cells was found dependent on E2F binding sequence motif, ABCC10 expression in G and S phases of the cell cycle of CWR22Rv1 cells, was analyzed. The cells were synchronized in G phase by double thymidine block and in S phase by thymidine/mimosine double block. ABCC10 mRNA level was found to be similar in S phase-synchronized and asynchronous cell populations. In G phase it decreased by 2.4- to 3-fold. It is thus inferred, that ABCC10 expression in CWR22Rv1 cells is not S phase-specific but is primarily associated with cell proliferation.'"
ABCC10,28583112,"'BACKGROUND: Tenofovir (TDF) is one of the most widely used antiretroviral drug. Despite the high degree of tolerability a small percentage of patients experienced alteration in tubular function during TDF use. Intracellular TDF disposition is regulated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters and, a reduced transport activity may be implicated in accumulation of TDF into the cells. The aim of our study was to assess the major determinants of TDF associated tubular dysfunction (KTD) in a real-life setting including the usefulness of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping into ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCC10 genes.\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all HIV positive patients who were followed at the Infectious Diseases Unit, DIBIC Luigi Sacco, University of Milan from April 2013 to June 2016. All patients treated with TDF who underwent a genotypization for the functional variants mapping in ABCC2 rs717620 (-24 C\xa0>\xa0T), ABCC4 rs1751034 (3463 A\xa0>\xa0G) and ABCC10 rs2125739 (T\xa0>\xa0C) were evaluated. KTD was defined as the presence of urine phosphate wasting and/or proteinuria at 24\xa0h urine analysis.\n\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight patients were genotyped, of which 42 (26.6%) experienced signs of KTD. No statistical significant differences were observed among patients with or without KTD regarding age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). The percentage of patients with KTD was higher among those with ""GG"" genotype at rs1751034 of ABCC4 compared to patients without KTD [6 (14.3%) vs 4 (3.5%), p\xa0=\xa00.01]. No statistical significant differences were observed regarding the distribution of ABCC2 and ABCC10 SNPs. Carriers of ""G"" allele in homozygous status at rs1751034 of ABCC4 showed a significant association with KTD (Odds Ratio 4.67, 95% CI 1.25-17.46, p\xa0=\xa00.02) in bivariate analysis, but this association was lost in multivariable analysis. A significant association between bone diseases and KTD was observed (Odds Ratio 3.178, 95%CI 1.529-6.603, p\xa0=\xa00.002).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: According to our results ABCC4 rs1751034 could be a genetic determinant of KTD; however validation studies are needed for therapy personalization. Noteworthy, a strong association between bone disease and KTD was also observed ADSL.'"
ABCC10,28265007,"'Paclitaxel is one of the most widely used antineoplastic drugs in the clinic. Unfortunately, the occurrence of cellular resistance has limited its efficacy and application. The ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1/P-glycoprotein) and subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10/MRP7) are the major membrane protein transporters responsible for the efflux of paclitaxel, constituting one of the most important mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance. Here, we demonstrated that the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of paclitaxel by antagonizing the efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCC10 in cells overexpressing these transporters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ABCB1 or ABCC10 protein expression was not altered after treatment with ibrutinib for up to 72 hours using Western blot analysis. However, the ATPase activity of ABCB1 was significantly stimulated by treatment with ibrutinib. Molecular docking analysis suggested the binding conformation of ibrutinib within the large cavity of the transmembrane region of ABCB1. Importantly, ibrutinib could effectively enhance paclitaxel-induced inhibition on the growth of ABCB1- and ABCC10-overexpressing tumors in nude athymic mice. These results demonstrate that the combination of ibrutinib and paclitaxel can effectively antagonize ABCB1- or ABCC10-mediated paclitaxel resistance that could be of great clinical interest. .'"
ABCC10,28058535,"""Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10) is a C subfamily member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. MRP7 is a lipophilic anion transporter that pumps endogenous and xenobiotic substrates from the cytoplasm to the extracellular milieu. Here, we cloned and characterized CsMRP7 as a novel ABC transporter from the Chinese liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis. Full-length cDNA of CsMRP7 was 5174\xa0nt, encoded 1636 amino acids (aa), and harbored a 147-bp 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and 116-bp 3'-UTR. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that CsMRP7 was closer to the ABCC subfamily than the ABCB subfamily. Tertiary structures of the N-terminal region (1-322 aa) and core region (323-1621 aa) of CsMRP7 were generated by homology modeling using glucagon receptor (PDB ID: 5ee7_A) and P-glycoprotein (PDB ID: 4f4c_A) as templates, respectively. CsMRP7 nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) was conserved more than NBD1, which was the sites of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Like typical long MRPs, CsMRP7 has an additional membrane-spanning domain 0 (MSD0) and cytoplasmic loop, along with a common structural fold consisting of MSD1-NBD1-MSD2-NBD2 as a single polypeptide assembly. MSD0, MSD1, and MSD2 consisted of TM1-7, TM8-13, and TM14-19, respectively. The CsMRP7 transcript was more abundant in the metacercariae than in the adult worms. Truncated NBD1 (39\xa0kDa) and NBD2 (44\xa0kDa) were produced in bacteria and mouse immune sera were raised. CsMRP7 was localized in the apical side of the intestinal epithelium, sperm in the testes and seminal receptacle, receptacle membrane, and mesenchymal tissue around intestine in the adult worm. These results provide molecular information and insights into structural and functional characteristics of CsMRP7 and homologs of flukes."""
ABCC10,25962593,"'INTRODUCTION: ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10) proteins are efflux transporters that couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to the translocation of toxic substances and chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells. Cabazitaxel is a novel taxane that differs from paclitaxel by its lower affinity for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.\n\nMETHODS: We determined the effects of cabazitaxel, a novel tubulin-binding taxane, and paclitaxel on paclitaxel-resistant, ABCB1-overexpressing KB-C2 and LLC-MDR1-WT cells and paclitaxel-resistant, ABCC10-overexpressing HEK293/ABCC10 cells by calculating the degree of drug resistance and measuring ATPase activity of the ABCB1 transporter.\n\nRESULTS: Decreased resistance to cabazitaxel compared with paclitaxel was observed in KB-C2, LLC-MDR1-WT, and HEK293/ABCC10 cells. Moreover, cabazitaxel had low efficacy, whereas paclitaxel had high efficacy in stimulating the ATPase activity of ABCB1, indicating a direct interaction of both drugs with the transporter.\n\nCONCLUSION: ABCB1 and ABCC10 are not primary resistance factors for cabazitaxel compared with paclitaxel, suggesting that cabazitaxel may have a low affinity for these efflux transporters.'"
ABCC10,25419978,"'The selective modulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pumps overexpressed in multidrug resistant cancers (MDR) and attendant resensitization to chemotherapeutic agents represent a promising strategy for treating cancer. We have synthesized four novel pentacyclic Strychnos alkaloids alstolucines B (2), F (3), and A (5) and N-demethylalstogucine (4), in addition to known Strychnos alkaloid echitamidine (16), and we evaluated compounds 1-5 in biochemical assays with ABCC10 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Alstolucines B (2) and F (3) inhibited ABCC10 ATPase activity at 12.5 μM without affecting P-gp function; moreover, they resensitized ABCC10-transfected cell lines to paclitaxel at 10 μM.

ABCC10,25402202,"'Paclitaxel exhibits clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. However, resistance to paclitaxel significantly attenuates the response to chemotherapy. The ABC transporter subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10), also known as multi-drug resistance protein 7 (MRP7) efflux transporter, is a major mediator of paclitaxel resistance. Here, we determine the effect of NVP-BHG712, a specific EphB4 receptor inhibitor, on 1) paclitaxel resistance in HEK293 cells transfected with ABCC10, 2) the growth of tumors in athymic nude mice that received NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel systemically and 3) the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in presence or absence of NVP-BHG712. NVP-BHG712 (0.5 μM), in HEK293/ABCC10 cells, significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel by inhibiting the efflux activity of ABCC10 without altering the expression level of the ABCC10 protein. Furthermore, NVP-BHG712 (25 mg/kg, p.o., q3d x 6), in combination with paclitaxel (15 mg/kg, i.p., q3d x 6), significantly inhibited the growth of ABCC10-expressing tumors in athymic nude mice. NVP-BHG712 administration significantly increased the levels of paclitaxel in the tumors but not in plasma compared to paclitaxel alone. The combination of NVP-BHG712 and paclitaxel could serve as a novel and useful therapeutic strategy to attenuate paclitaxel resistance mediated by the expression of the ABCC10 transporter.'"
ABCC10,24939447,"'ARRY-334543 is a small molecule inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases. We conducted this study to determine whether ARRY-334543 can enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer drugs through interaction with ABC transporters. Lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 and its ABCG2-overexpressing NCI-H460/MX20, as well as the ABCG2-, ABCB1-, and ABCC10-overexpressing transfected cell lines were used for the reversal study. Our results demonstrated that ARRY-334543 (1.0\u2009μM) significantly reversed ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) by directly inhibiting the drug efflux function of ABCG2, resulting in the elevated intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in the ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines. In addition, in isolated membranes, ARRY-334543 stimulated ATPase activity and inhibited photolabeling of ABCG2 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner indicating that this drug directly interacts at the drug-binding pocket of this transporter. ARRY-334543 (1.0\u2009μM) only slightly reversed ABCB1- and partially reversed ABCC10-mediated MDR suggesting that it exhibits high affinity toward ABCG2. Moreover, homology modeling predicted the binding conformation of ARRY-334543 at Arg482 centroid-based grid of ABCG2. However, ARRY-334543 at reversal concentrations did not affect the expression level of ABCG2, AKT and ERK1/2 and regulate the re-localization of ABCG2.

ABCC10,24937702,"'Cancer cells often become resistant to chemotherapy through a phenomenon known as multidrug resistance (MDR). Several factors are responsible for the development of MDR, preeminent among them being the accelerated drug efflux mediated by overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Some small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were recently reported to modulate the activity of ABC transporters. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if motesanib, a multikinase inhibitor, could reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR. The results showed that motesanib significantly sensitized both ABCB1-transfected and drug-selected cell lines overexpressing this transporter to its substrate anticancer drugs. Motesanib significantly increased the accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel in ABCB1 overexpressing cells by blocking the efflux function of ABCB1 transporter. In contrast, no significant change in the expression levels and localization pattern of ABCB1 was observed when ABCB1 overexpressing cells were exposed to 3μM motesanib for 72h. Moreover, motesanib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating a direct interaction with the transporter. Consistent with these findings, the docking studies indicated favorable binding of motesanib within the transmembrane region of homology modeled human ABCB1. Here, we report for the first time, motesanib, at clinically achievable plasma concentrations, antagonizes MDR by inhibiting the efflux activity of the ABCB1 transporter. These findings may be useful for cancer combination therapy with TKIs in the clinic.'"
ABCC10,24937672,"'BACKGROUND: Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a major obstacle to cancer treatment. A group of ABC efflux pumps, the Multidrug Resistance Proteins, is a source of resistance. Herein, we investigated the role of ABCC10 in mammary tumours, given the important role we have defined for ABCC10 in transporting taxanes, and the recognition that some ABCC proteins have roles in tumour growth.\n\nMETHODS: ABCC10 expression was correlated to human breast cancer subtype using breast tissue microarrays. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to examine ABCC10 expression in human breast cancer lines. Abcc10(-/-) mice were crossed to MMTV-PyVmT mice to produce Abcc10(-/-) vs Abcc10(+/+) mammary tumours and derivative cell lines. We used allograft and cellular assays to perform baseline and drug sensitization analysis of tumours and cell lines.\n\nRESULTS: Clinical sample analyses indicated that ABCC10 was more highly expressed in Her2+ and ER+ than in Her2-, ER-, and triple-negative breast cancer. Unexpectedly, PyVmT; Abcc10(-/-) tumours grew more rapidly than PyVmT; Abcc10(+/+) tumours and were associated with significantly reduced apoptosis and metastasis. PyVmT; Abcc10(-/-) lines were less migratory than PyVmT; Abcc10(+/+) lines. Finally, we showed increased survival of docetaxel-treated MMTV-PyVmT; Abcc10(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data identify roles for Abcc10 in breast cancer pathogenesis and in vivo docetaxel resistance.'"

Recent studies revealed increased paclitaxel sensitivity in the Mrp7(-/-) mouse model compared to their wild-type counterparts. This demonstrates that MRP7 is a key contributor in developing drug resistance.

ABCC10,24840820,"'ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are members of a large superfamily of proteins that utilize ATP hydrolysis to translocate a wide range of substrates across biological membranes. In general, members of C subfamily (ABCC) are structurally characterized by an additional (N-terminal) transmembrane domain (TMD0). Phylogenetic analysis of plant ABCCs separates their protein sequences into three distinct clusters: I and II are plant specific whereas cluster III contains both human and plant ABCCs. Screening of the Plant Medicinal Genomics Resource database allowed us to identify 16 ABCCs partial sequences in Catharanthus roseus; two of which belong to the unique CrABCC1 transcript that we identified in cluster III. Genomic organization of CrABCC1 TMD0 coding sequence displays an AT-AC U12-type intron that is conserved in higher plant orthologues. We showed that CrABCC1, like its human orthologue ABCC10, produces alternative transcripts that encode protein sequences with a truncated form of TMD0 without the first transmembrane span (TM1). Subcellular localization of CrABCC1 TMD0 variants using yellow fluorescent protein fusions reveals that the TM1 is required for a correct routing of the TMD0 to the tonoplast. Finally, the specific repartition of CrABCC1 orthologues in some species suggests that this gene was lost several times during evolution and that its physiological function may, rely on a common feature of multicellular eukaryotes.'"

Linsitinib moderately enhanced the cytotoxicity of vincristine in cell lines overexpressing ABCB1, whereas it did not alter the cytotoxicity of substrates of ABCC1. Furthermore, linsitinib significantly increased the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of [(3)H]-MX in ABCG2-overexpressing cells and [(3)H]-paclitaxel in ABCC10-overexpressing cells. However, linsitinib, at a concentration that reversed MDR, did not significantly alter the expression levels of either the ABCG2 or ABCC10 transporter proteins. Furthermore, linsitinib did not significantly alter the intracellular localization of ABCG2 or ABCC10. Moreover, linsitinib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner.

ABCC10,24634705,"'Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. ""Driver"" and ""passenger"" mutations identified in lung cancer indicate that genetics play a major role in the development of the disease, progression, metastasis and response to therapy. Survival rates for lung cancer treatment have remained stagnant at ~15% over the past 40 years in patients with disseminated disease despite advances in surgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Resistance to therapy; either intrinsic or acquired has been a major hindrance to treatment leading to great interest in studies seeking to understand and overcome resistance. Genetic information gained from molecular analyses has been critical in identifying druggable targets and tumor profiles that may be predictors of therapeutic response and mediators of resistance. Mutated or overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and translocations in the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ()-anaplastic lymphoma kinase () genes (EML4-ALK) are examples of genetic aberrations resulting in targeted therapies for both localized and metastatic disease. Positive clinical responses have been noted in patients harboring these genetic mutations when treated with targeted therapies compared to patients lacking these mutations. Resistance is nonetheless a major factor contributing to the failure of targeted agents and standard cytotoxic agents. In this review, we examine molecular mechanisms that are potential drivers of resistance in non-small cell lung carcinoma, the most frequently diagnosed form of lung cancer.

ABCC10,24481648,"'The presence of acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) is AKT1S1 one of the primary impediments to the success of chemotherapy. MDR is often a result of overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are involved in the extrusion of therapeutic drugs. Recently, it was shown that several ABC transporters could be modulated by specific tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Ponatinib, a multi-targeted TKI, inhibits the activity of BCR-ABL with very high potency and broad specificity, including the T315I mutation which confers resistance to other TKIs. It was reported that ponatinib was capable of reversing breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)- and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated MDR. In the present study, we report for the first time that ponatinib also potentiates the cytotoxicity of widely used therapeutic substrates of MRP7, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine and vinblastine. Ponatinib significantly enhances the accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in cells expressing MRP7. Furthermore, accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel was achieved by inhibition of MRP7-mediated transport. Ponatinb limited drug export via MRP7 by multiple mechanisms. In addition to inhibition of pump function, ponatinib also downregulated MRP7 protein expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Thus, ponatinib may represent a potential reversal agent for the treatment of MDR and may be useful for combination therapy in MDR cancer patients in clinical practice.'"

The ABC transporter subfamily C member 10 (ABCC10), also known as multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7) efflux transporter, is a major mediator of paclitaxel resistance. In this study, we show that masitinib, a small molecule stem-cell growth factor receptor (c-Kit) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at nontoxic concentrations, significantly attenuates paclitaxel resistance in HEK293 cells transfected with ABCC10. Our in vitro studies indicated that masitinib (2.5 μmol/L) enhanced the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of paclitaxel by inhibiting the ABCC10 transport activity without altering the expression level of ABCC10 protein. Furthermore, masitinib, in combination with paclitaxel, significantly inhibited the growth of ABCC10-expressing tumors in nude athymic mice in vivo. Masitinib administration also resulted in a significant increase in the levels of paclitaxel in the plasma, tumors, and lungs compared with paclitaxel alone. In conclusion, the combination of paclitaxel and masitinib could serve as a novel and useful therapeutic strategy to reverse paclitaxel resistance mediated by ABCC10.'"

The comparative analysis indentified over 2900 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs) between these two strains. Gene Ontology analysis placed these unigenes primarily into cell, cell part, organelle, binding, catalytic, cellular process, metabolic process, and response to stimulus categories. Based on pathway analyses, DEUs were enriched in oxidoreductase activity and membrane lipid metabolic processes, and they were also significantly enriched in pathways related to the metabolic and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most of the unigenes involved in the metabolic pathway were up-regulated in resistant strains. Within the ABC transporter pathway, majority of the down-regulated unigenes belong to ABCC2 and ABCC10, respectively, while up-regulated unigenes were mainly categorized as ABCG2. Furthermore, two aminopeptidases, and four cadherins encoding genes were significantly elevated as well.

Accumulation and efflux experiments demonstrated that BBA increased the intracellular accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel by inhibiting the efflux of [(3)H]-paclitaxel from HEK293/MRP7 cells. In addition, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses indicated no significant alteration of MRP7 protein expression and localization in plasma membranes after treatment with BBA. These results demonstrate that BBA reverses MRP7-mediated MDR through blocking the drug efflux function of MRP7 without affecting the intracellular ATP levels.

ABCC10,23663308,"'BACKGROUND: The ABC (ATP-binding cassette) gene superfamily is widespread across all living species. The majority of ABC genes encode ABC transporters, which are membrane-spanning proteins capable of transferring substrates across biological membranes by hydrolyzing ATP. Although ABC transporters have often been associated with resistance to drugs and toxic compounds, within the Arthropoda ABC gene families have only been characterized in detail in several insects and a crustacean. In this study, we report a genome-wide survey and expression analysis of the ABC gene superfamily in the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a chelicerate ~ 450 million years diverged from other Arthropod lineages. T. urticae is a major agricultural pest, and is among of the most polyphagous arthropod herbivores known. The species resists a staggering array of toxic plant secondary metabolites, and has developed resistance to all major classes of pesticides in use for its control.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 103 ABC genes in the T. urticae genome, the highest number discovered in a metazoan species to date. Within the T. urticae ABC gene set, all members of the eight currently described subfamilies (A to H) were detected. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the high number of ABC genes in T. urticae is due primarily to lineage-specific expansions of ABC genes within the ABCC, ABCG and ABCH subfamilies. In particular, the ABCC subfamily harbors the highest number of T. urticae ABC genes (39). In a comparative genomic analysis, we found clear orthologous relationships between a subset of T. urticae ABC proteins and ABC proteins in both vertebrates and invertebrates known to be involved in fundamental cellular processes. These included members of the ABCB-half transporters, and the ABCD, ABCE and ABCF families. Furthermore, one-to-one orthologues could be distinguished between T. urticae proteins and human ABCC10, ABCG5 and ABCG8, the Drosophila melanogaster sulfonylurea receptor and ecdysone-regulated transporter E23. Finally, expression profiling revealed that ABC genes in the ABCC, ABCG ABCH subfamilies were differentially expressed in multi-pesticide resistant mite strains and/or in mites transferred to challenging (toxic) host plants.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study we present the first comprehensive analysis of ABC genes in a polyphagous arthropod herbivore. We demonstrate that the broad plant host range and high levels of pesticide resistance in T. urticae are associated with lineage-specific expansions of ABC genes, many of which respond transcriptionally to xenobiotic exposure. This ABC catalogue will serve as a basis for future biochemical and toxicological studies. Obtaining functional evidence that these ABC subfamilies contribute to xenobiotic tolerance should be the priority of future research.'"
ABCC10,23525656,"'It is well established that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major mechanisms that causes resistance to antineoplastic drugs in cancer cells. ABC transporters can significantly decrease the intracellular concentration of antineoplastic drugs by increasing their efflux, thereby lowering their cytotoxic activity. One of these transporters, the multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7/ABCC10), has already been shown to produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs by increasing the efflux of the drugs. In the present study, we investigated whether tandutinib, an FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor, has the potential to reverse MRP7-mediated MDR. Our results revealed that tandutinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to the 2 established MRP7 substrates, paclitaxel and vincristine, whereas there was less or no effect on the control vector-transfected HEK293 cells. [³H]-paclitaxel accumulation and efflux studies demonstrated that tandutinib increased the intracellular accumulation of [³H]-paclitaxel and inhibited the efflux of [³H]-paclitaxel from HEK-MRP7 cells. In addition, western blot analysis showed that tandutinib did not significantly affect MRP7 expression.

Association of ABCs levels with clinical-pathologic characteristics and KRAS mutation status was followed as well.\n\nMETHODS: Tumors and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues were obtained from 32 histologically verified PDAC patients. The transcript profile of ABCs was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with a relative standard curve. KRAS mutations in exon 2 were assessed by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing.\n\nRESULTS: Most ABCs were deregulated in PDAC and 10 ABCs were associated with clinical-pathologic characteristics. KRAS mutations did not change the global expression profile of ABCs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The expression of ABC transporters was significantly deregulated in PDAC tumors when compared to nonmalignant tissues. The observed up-regulation of ABCB4, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCC5, ABCC10, and ABCG2 in tumors may contribute to the generally poor treatment response of PDAC. The up-regulation of ABCA1, ABCA7, and ABCG1 implicates a serious impairment of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in PDAC.

We found that tariquidar, at 0.1 and 0.3 µM, significantly potentiated the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to MRP7 substrates and increased the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel. We further demonstrated that tariquidar directly impaired paclitaxel efflux and could downregulate MRP7 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after prolonged treatment. Our findings suggest that tariquidar, at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, reverses MRP7-mediated MDR through inhibition of MRP7 protein expression and function, and thus represents a promising therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of chemoresistant cancer patients.'"

However, for many antiretroviral drugs, including maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist, very little data exist regarding placental transfer. Besides, various factors may modulate this transfer, including efflux transporters belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. We investigated maraviroc placental transfer and the influence of ABC transporter expression on this transfer using the human cotyledon perfusion model. Term placentas were perfused ex vivo for 90 min with maraviroc (600 ng/ml) either in the maternal-to-fetal (n = 10 placentas) or fetal-to-maternal (n = 6 placentas) direction. Plasma concentrations were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Fetal transfer rates (FTR) and clearance indexes (CLI) were calculated as ratios of fetal to maternal concentrations at steady state (mean values between 30 and 90 min) and ratios of FTR of maraviroc to that of antipyrine, respectively. ABC transporter gene expression levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and ABCB1 protein expression by Western blotting. For the maternal-to-fetal direction, the mean FTR and CLI were 8.0% ± 3.0 and 0.26 ± 0.07, respectively, whereas the mean CLI was 0.52 ± 0.23 for the fetal-to-maternal direction. We showed a significant inverse correlation between maraviroc CLI and ABCC2, ABCC10, and ABCC11 placental gene expression levels (P < 0.05). To conclude, we report a low maraviroc placental transfer probably involving ABC efflux transporters and thus in all likelihood associated with a limited fetal exposition.

We also defined the E(2)17βG antagonist, tamoxifen, as a novel substrate and stimulator of ABCC10. In addition, a number of cytotoxic substrates, including docetaxel, paclitaxel, and Ara-C, increased the ABCC10 basal ATPase activity. We determined that ABCC10 localizes to the basolateral cell surface, using transepithelial well assays to establish that ABCC10-overexpressing LLC-PK1 cells exported [(3)H]-docetaxel from the apical to the basolateral side. Importantly, we found that the clinically valuable multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, and a natural alkaloid, cepharanthine, inhibited ABCC10 docetaxel transport activity. Thus, concomitant use of these agents might restore the intracellular accumulation and potency of ABCC10-exported cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel.

This study was aimed to investigate whether Tet and BrTet can inhibit the expression level of MRP7 so as to further look into the mechanisms of the reversal effects of Tet and BrTet on MDR. The inhibitory effects of daunorubicin (DNR) used alone on the proliferation of K562 and K562/A02 cells were evaluated by MTT assay, the IC(50) of DNR and drug resistant folds were calculated. The mRNA level of MRP7 was tested by real-time PCR, and the protein levels of MRP7 and P-gp were tested by Western blot. The DNR accumulation was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed that the resistance of K562/A02 cells to DNR was 23.65-folds of that of K562 cells. After administration of 1 µmol/L Tet or 2 µmol/L BrTet, the mRNA level of MRP7 in the K562/A02 cells decreased to 2% and 12% respectively, and the protein level of MRP7 decreased by 53.2% and 83.7% respectively. The protein level of P-gp decreased by 58.47% and 52.20% in the 1 µmol/L Tet and 2 µmol/L BrTet groups. FCM detection showed that 1 µmol/L Tet and 2 µmol/L BrTet significantly increased the accumulation of DNR in K562/A02 cells by 94.32% and 271% respectively. It is concluded that Tet and BrTet both can reverse MDR in vitro. The mechanisms may be related to the inhibition of MRP7 overexpression and the increase of anticancer drug concentration in cells.

In the present study, we assessed whether zafirlukast could be a reversal agent for other ABC transporter-mediated MDR. Using the MTT assay, we found that zafirlukast enhanced the cytotoxicity of several anticancer drugs that are substrates of breast cancer resistance proteins (BCRP/ABCG2), including mitoxantrone and SN-38. Furthermore, zafirlukast could partially reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated (P-gp/ABCB1) and MRP7 (ABCC10)-mediated MDR at nontoxic doses. Studies on [(3)H]-mitoxantrone accumulation and efflux have shown that zafirlukast increases the intracellular accumulation of [(3)H]-mitoxantrone by directly inhibiting ABCG2-mediated drug efflux. Western blot analysis indicated that zafirlukast did not alter the expression of ABCG2.

The majority of the studied ABCs were down-regulated or unchanged between tumours and control tissues. ABCA12, ABCA13, ABCB6, ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCE1 were up-regulated in tumours versus control tissues. Transcript levels of ABCA12, ABCC7 and ABCC8 increased in direction from colon to rectum. Additionally, transcript levels of ABCB9, ABCB11, ABCG5 and ABCG8 followed the reverse significant trend, i.e. a decrease in direction from colon to rectum. The transcript level of ABCC10 in tumours correlated with the grade (P = 0.01). Transcript levels of ABCC6, ABCC11, ABCF1 and ABCF2 were significantly lower in non-responders to palliative chemotherapy in comparison with responders. The disease-free interval of patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly shorter in patients with low transcript levels of ABCA7, ABCA13, ABCB4, ABCC11 and ABCD4.

Multivariate regression analysis identified carriage of a composite genotype of ABCC10 rs2125739 and CYP2B6 516G>T (P=0.001), time post dose (P=0.01) and BMI (P=0.07) to be independently associated with nevirapine plasma concentrations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Nevirapine is a substrate for ABCC10 and genetic variants influence its plasma concentrations. ABCC10 in lymphocytes and macrophages may also contribute to variability in intracellular permeation of nevirapine. Further studies are required to determine the clinical implications of these findings.'"
ABCC10,21932399,"'UNLABELLED: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are drug efflux pumps responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype causing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment failure. Here we studied the expression of 15 ABC transporters relevant for multidrug resistance in 19 paired HCC patient samples (16 untreated, 3 treated by chemotherapeutics). Twelve ABC transporters showed up-regulation in HCC compared with adjacent healthy liver. These include ABCA2, ABCB1, ABCB6, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCC10, ABCC11, ABCC12, and ABCE1. The expression profile and function of some of these transporters have not been associated with HCC thus far. Because cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing, we hypothesized that regulation of ABC expression in HCC might be mediated by miRNAs. To study this, miRNAs were profiled and dysregulation of 90 miRNAs was shown in HCC compared with healthy liver, including up-regulation of 11 and down-regulation of 79. miRNA target sites in ABC genes were bioinformatically predicted and experimentally verified in vitro using luciferase reporter assays. In total, 13 cellular miRNAs were confirmed that target ABCA1, ABCC1, ABCC5, ABCC10, and ABCE1 genes and mediate changes in gene expression. Correlation analysis between ABC and miRNA expression in individual patients revealed an inverse relationship, providing an indication for miRNA regulation of ABC genes in HCC.\n\nCONCLUSION: Up-regulation of ABC transporters in HCC occurs prior to chemotherapeutic treatment and is associated with miRNA down-regulation. Up-regulation of five ABC genes appears to be mediated by 13 cellular miRNAs in HCC patient samples. miRNA-based gene therapy may be a novel and promising way to affect the ABC profile and overcome clinical multidrug resistance.'"
ABCC10,21804948,"""Gemcitabine is a cytidine analogue used in the treatment of various solid tumors. Little is known about how gemcitabine and its metabolites are transported out of cells. We set out to study the efflux of gemcitabine and the possible consequences of that process in cancer cells. We observed the efflux of gemcitabine and its deaminated metabolite, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) using high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after gemcitabine treatment. Non-selective ABCC-transport inhibition with probenecid significantly increased intracellular dFdU concentrations, with a similar trend observed with verapamil, a non-selective ABCB1 and ABCG2 transport inhibitor. Neither probenecid nor verapamil altered intracellular gemcitabine levels after the inhibition of deamination with tetrahydrourudine, suggesting that efflux of dFdU, but not gemcitabine, was mediated by ABC transporters. MTS assays showed that probenecid increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. While dFdU displayed little cytotoxicity, intracellular dFdU accumulation inhibited cytidine deaminase, resulting in increased gemcitabine levels and enhanced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of ABCC3, ABCC5 or ABCC10 individually did not significantly increase gemcitabine sensitivity, suggesting the involvement of multiple transporters. In summary, ABCC-mediated efflux may contribute to gemcitabine resistance through increased dFdU efflux that allows for the continuation of gemcitabine deamination. Reversing efflux-mediated gemcitabine resistance may require broad-based efflux inhibition."""
ABCC10,21628669,"'BACKGROUND: Tenofovir (TFV) causes kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) in some patients, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Genetic variants in TFV transporters are implicated; we explored whether ABCC10 transports TFV and whether ABCC10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with KTD.\n\nMETHODS: TFV accumulation was assessed in parental and ABCC10-transfected HEK293 cells (HEK293-ABCC10), CD4(+) cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Substrate specificity was confirmed by cepharanthine (ABCC10 inhibitor) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies. Fourteen SNPs in ABCC10 were genotyped in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients with KTD (n = 19) or without KTD (controls; n = 96). SNP and haplotype analysis was performed using Haploview.\n\nRESULTS: TFV accumulation was significantly lower in HEK293-ABCC10 cell lines than in parental HEK293 cells (35% lower; P = .02); this was reversed by cepharanthine. siRNA knockdown of ABCC10 resulted in increased accumulation of TFV in CD4(+) cells (18%; P = .04) and MDMs (25%; P = .04). Two ABCC10 SNPs (rs9349256: odds ratio [OR], 2.3; P = .02; rs2125739, OR, 2.0; P = .05) and their haplotype (OR, 2.1; P = .05) were significantly associated with KTD. rs9349256 was associated with urine phosphorus wasting (P = .02) and β2 microglobulinuria (P = .04).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TFV is a substrate for ABCC10, and genetic variability within the ABCC10 gene may influence TFV renal tubular transport and contribute to the development of KTD. These results need to be replicated in other cohorts.'"
ABCC10,21576088,"'Recently, we reported that the ATP-binding cassette transporter 10 (ABCC10), also known as multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), is able to confer resistance to a variety of anticancer agents, including taxanes. However, the in vivo functions of the pump have not been determined to any extent. In this study, we generated and analyzed Abcc10(-/-) mice to investigate the ability of Abcc10 to function as an endogenous resistance factor. Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Abcc10(-/-) mice were hypersensitive to docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, and cytarabine (Ara-C) and exhibited increased cellular drug accumulation, relative to wild-type controls. Abcc10(-/-) null mice treated with paclitaxel exhibited increased lethality associated with neutropenia and marked bone marrow toxicity. In addition, toxicity in spleen and thymus was evident. These findings indicate that Abcc10 is dispensable for health and viability and that it is an endogenous resistance factor for taxanes, other natural product agents, and nucleoside analogues. This is the first demonstration that an ATP-binding cassette transporter other than P-glycoprotein can affect in vivo tissue sensitivity toward taxanes.'"
ABCC10,21487100,"'BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous cancer that frequently exhibits aberrant kinase signaling. We investigated a treatment strategy combining sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with limited single-agent activity in AML, and cytarabine, a key component of AML chemotherapy.\n\nMETHODS: Using 10 human AML cell lines, we determined the effects of sorafenib (10 μM) on antileukemic activity by measuring cell viability, proliferation, ERK1/2 signaling, and apoptosis. We also investigated the effects of sorafenib treatment on the accumulation of cytarabine and phosphorylated metabolites in vitro. A human equivalent dose of sorafenib in nontumor-bearing NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice was determined by pharmacokinetic studies using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, and steady-state concentrations were estimated by the fit of a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model to concentration-time data. The antitumor activity of sorafenib alone (60 mg/kg) twice daily, cytarabine alone (6.25 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally), or sorafenib once or twice daily plus cytarabine was evaluated in NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice bearing AML xenografts.\n\nRESULTS: Sorafenib at 10 μM inhibited cell viability, proliferation and ERK1/2 signaling, and induced apoptosis in all cell lines studied. Sorafenib also increased the cellular accumulation of cytarabine and metabolites resulting in additive to synergistic antileukemic activity. A dose of 60 mg/kg in mice produced a human equivalent sorafenib steady-state plasma exposure of 10 μM. The more dose-intensive twice-daily sorafenib plus cytarabine (n = 15) statistically significantly prolonged median survival in an AML xenograft model compared with sorafenib once daily plus cytarabine (n = 12), cytarabine alone (n = 26), or controls (n = 27) (sorafenib twice daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 46 days; sorafenib once daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 40 days; cytarabine alone, median survival = 36 days; control, median survival = 19 days; P < .001 for combination twice daily vs all other treatments listed).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib in combination with cytarabine resulted in strong anti-AML activity in vitro and in vivo. These results warrant clinical evaluation of sorafenib with cytarabine-based regimens in molecularly heterogeneous AML.'"
ABCC10,21166459,"'The onset of multidrug resistance (MDR) in ovarian cancer is one of the main causes of treatment failure and low survival rates. Inadequate drug exposure and treatment-free periods due to intermittent chemotherapy select for cancer cells overexpressing drug efflux transporters, resulting in resistant disease. The present study examines the sustained administration of the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel (DTX) alone and in combination with cepharanthine (CEP), a potent drug efflux transporter inhibitor. DTX and CEP were delivered via the intraperitoneal route in a sustained manner using an injectable polymer-lipid formulation. In vitro, the combination strategy resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) more apoptosis, greater intracellular accumulation of DTX, and lower DTX efflux in ovarian cancer cells showing the MDR phenotype. In vivo, sustained treatment with DTX and CEP showed significantly greater (p < 0.05) tumor inhibition (91 ± 4%) in a murine model of multidrug resistant ovarian cancer compared to sustained DTX treatment (76 ± 6%) and was more than twice as efficacious as intermittent DTX treatment. Overall findings from these studies highlight the impact of sustained delivery of monotherapy and combination therapy in the management of refractory ovarian cancer displaying the MDR phenotype.'"
ABCC10,21107721,"""The Porcine SNP database has a huge number of SNPs, but these SNPs are mostly found by computer data-mining procedures and have not been well characterized. We re-sequenced 1,439 porcine public SNPs from four commercial pig breeds and one Korean domestic breed (Korean Native pig, KNP) by using two DNA pools from eight unrelated animals in each breed. These SNPs were from 419 protein-coding genes covering the 18 autosomes, and the re-sequencing in breeds confirmed 690 public SNPs (47.9%) and 226 novel mutations (173 SNPs and 53 insertions/deletions). Thus, totally, 916 variations were found from our study. Of the 916 variations, 148 SNPs (16.2%) were found across all the five breeds, and 199 SNPs (21.7%) were breed specific polymorphisms. According to the SNP locations in the gene sequences, these 916 variations were categorized into 802 non-coding SNPs (785 in intron, 17 in 3'-UTR) and 114 coding SNPs (86 synonymous SNPs, 28 non-synonymous SNPs). The nucleotide substitution analyses for these SNPs revealed that 70.2% were from transitions, 20.0% from transversions, and the remaining 5.79% were deletions or insertions. Subsequently, we genotyped 261 SNPs from 180 genes in an experimental KNP × Landrace F2 cross by the Sequenom MassARRAY system. A total of 33 traits including growth, carcass composition and meat quality were analyzed for the phenotypic association tests using the 132 SNPs in 108 genes with minor allele frequency (MAF)>0.2. The association results showed that five marker-trait combinations were significant at the 5% experiment-wise level (ADCK4 for rear leg, MYH3 for rear leg, Hunter B, Loin weight and Shearforce) and four at the 10% experiment-wise level (DHX38 for average daily gain at live weight, LGALS9 for crude lipid, NGEF for front leg and LIFR for pH at 24 h). In addition, 49 SNPs in 44 genes showing significant association with the traits were detected at the 1% comparison-wise level. A large number of genes that function as enzymes, transcription factors or signalling molecules were considered as genetic markers for pig growth (RNF103, TSPAN31, DHX38, ABCF1, ABCC10, SCD5, KIAA0999 and FKBP10), muscling (HSPA5, PTPRM, NUP88, ADCK4, PLOD1, DLX1 and GRM8), fatness (PTGIS, IDH3B, RYR2 and NOL4) and meat quality traits (DUSP4, LIFR, NGEF, EWSR1, ACTN2, PLXND1, DLX3, LGALS9, ENO3, EPRS, TRIM29, EHMT2, RBM42, SESN2 and RAB4B).

ABCC10,20719174,"'BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main reason of the failure of chemotherapy in lung cancer. The MDR mechanism in lung cancer is complex, which relates to sorts of drug resistant genes. ABCC10 is a recently identified member of a subset of the C family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The drug resistance capability of ABCC10 has been partly determined. The aim of the study is to investigate the expression of ABCC10 in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal tissues, and analyze the relationship between ABCC10 expression level and clinical features, such as TNM stages, histological types and pathological grades.\n\nMETHODS: The expression of ABCC10 was detected in squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and normal lung tissues by immunohistochemistry. Then the statistical analysis was performed.\n\nRESULTS: The expression of ABCC10 was mainly located in cell membrane and cytoplasm. There were significant differences between the expression of ABCC10 in NSCLC and normal tissues (P<0.01). The positive rates in squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma were 73.26% and 81.16%, respectively with significant differences (P<0.05). There were significant differences among histological grades in squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.01). There were significant differences among histological grades and TNM stages respectively in adenocarcinoma (P<0.01).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: ABCC10 is overexpressed in NSCLC. The expression of ABCC10 in adenocarcinoma is higher than that in squamous cell carcinoma. The expression in adenocarcinoma is correlated to pathological grades and TNM stages.

ABCC10,20696137,"'Previously, we reported sipholenol A, a sipholane triterpenoid from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella, as a potent reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells that overexpressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Through extensive screening of several related sipholane triterpenoids that have been isolated from the same sponge, we identified sipholenone E, sipholenol L and siphonellinol D as potent reversals of MDR in cancer cells. These compounds enhanced the cytotoxicity of several P-gp substrate anticancer drugs, including colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel, and significantly reversed the MDR-phenotype in P-gp-overexpressing MDR cancer cells KB-C2 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, these three sipholanes had no effect on the response to cytotoxic agents in cells lacking P-gp expression or expressing MRP1 (ABCC1) or MRP7 (ABCC10) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). All three sipholanes (IC(50) >50 μM) were not toxic to all the cell lines that were used. [(3)H]-Paclitaxel accumulation and efflux studies demonstrated that all three triterpenoids time-dependently increased the intracellular accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel by directly inhibiting P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Sipholanes also inhibited calcein-AM transport from P-gp-overexpressing cells. The Western blot analysis revealed that these three triterpenoids did not alter the expression of P-gp. However, they stimulated P-gp ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the photolabeling of this transporter with its transport substrate [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin. In silico molecular docking aided the virtual identification of ligand binding sites of these compounds. In conclusion, sipholane triterpenoids efficiently inhibit the function of P-gp through direct interactions and may represent potential reversal agents for the treatment of MDR.'"
ABCC10,19841739,"'BACKGROUND: One of the major mechanisms that could produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs in cancer cells is the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The ABC transporters can significantly decrease the intracellular concentration of antineoplastic drugs by increasing their efflux, thereby lowering the cytotoxic activity of antineoplastic drugs. One of these transporters, the multiple resistant protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10), has recently been shown to produce resistance to antineoplastic drugs by increasing the efflux of paclitaxel. In this study, we examined the effects of BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib on the activity and expression of MRP7 in HEK293 cells transfected with MRP7, designated HEK-MRP7-2.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND/OR PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report for the first time that imatinib and nilotinib reversed MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance. Our MTT assay results indicated that MRP7 expression in HEK-MRP7-2 cells was not significantly altered by incubation with 5 microM of imatinib or nilotinib for up to 72 hours. In addition, imatinib and nilotinib (1-5 microM) produced a significant concentration-dependent reversal of MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance by enhancing the sensitivity of HEK-MRP7-2 cells to paclitaxel and vincristine. Imatinib and nilotinib, at 5 microM, significantly increased the accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel in HEK-MRP7-2 cells. The incubation of the HEK-MRP7-2 cells with imatinib or nilotinib (5 microM) also significantly inhibited the efflux of paclitaxel.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Imatinib and nilotinib reverse MRP7-mediated paclitaxel resistance, most likely due to their inhibition of the efflux of paclitaxel via MRP7. These findings suggest that imatinib or nilotinib, in combination with other antineoplastic drugs, may be useful in the treatment of certain resistant cancers.'"
ABCC10,19805291,"'Mitoferrin-1 (Mfrn1; Slc25a37), a member of the solute carrier family localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, functions as an essential iron importer for the synthesis of mitochondrial heme and iron-sulfur clusters in erythroblasts. The biochemistry of Mfrn1-mediated iron transport into the mitochondria, however, is poorly understood. Here, we used the strategy of in vivo epitope-tagging affinity purification and mass spectrometry to investigate Mfrn1-mediated mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Abcb10, a mitochondrial inner membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter highly induced during erythroid maturation in hematopoietic tissues, was found as one key protein that physically interacts with Mfrn1 during mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. Mfrn1 was shown previously to have a longer protein half-life in differentiated MEL cells compared with undifferentiated cells. In this study, Abcb10 was found to enhance the stabilization of Mfrn1 protein in MEL cells and transfected heterologous COS7 cells. In undifferentiated MEL cells, cotransfected Abcb10 specifically interacts with Mfrn1 to enhance its protein stability and promote Mfrn1-dependent mitochondrial iron importation. The structural stabilization of the Mfrn1-Abcb10 complex demonstrates a previously uncharacterized function for Abcb10 in mitochondria. Furthermore, the binding domain of Mfrn1-Abcb10 interaction maps to the N terminus of Mfrn1. These results suggest the tight regulation of mitochondrial iron acquisition and heme synthesis in erythroblasts is mediated by both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, whereby the high level of Mfrn1 is stabilized by oligomeric protein complexes.'"

We recently reported a new pharmacological action of the 4-anilinoquinazoline derived EGFR TKIs, such as lapatinib (Tykerb) and erlotinib (Tarceva), which significantly affect the drug resistance patterns in cells expressing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Previously, we showed that lapatinib and erlotinib could inhibit the drug efflux function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and ABCG2 transporters. In this study, we determined if these TKIs have the potential to reverse MDR due to the presence of the multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10). Our results showed that lapatinib and erlotinib dose-dependently enhanced the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to several established MRP7 substrates, specifically docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinblastine and vinorelbine, whereas there was no or a less effect on the control vector transfected HEK293 cells. [(3)H]-paclitaxel accumulation and efflux studies demonstrated that lapatinib and erlotinib increased the intracellular accumulation of [(3)H]-paclitaxel and inhibited the efflux of [(3)H]-paclitaxel from MRP7-transfected cells but not in the control cell line. Lapatinib is a more potent inhibitor of MRP7 than erlotinib. In addition, the Western blot analysis revealed that both lapatinib and erlotinib did not significantly affect MRP7 expression. We conclude that the EGFR TKIs, lapatinib and erlotinib reverse MRP7-mediated MDR through inhibition of the drug efflux function, suggesting that an EGFR TKI based combinational therapy may be applicable for chemotherapeutic practice clinically.'"

However, compounds that are able to reverse MRP7-mediated cellular resistance have not been identified. In this study, we examined the effects of cepharanthine (6',12'-dimethoxy-2,2'-dimethyl-6,7-[methylenebis(oxy)]oxyacanthan), an herbal extract isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata, to reverse paclitaxel resistance in MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells. Cepharanthine, at 2microM, completely reversed paclitaxel resistance in MRP7-transfected cells. In contrast, the effect of cepharanthine on the parental transfected cells was significantly less than that on the MRP7-transfected cells. In addition, cepharanthine significantly increased the accumulation of paclitaxel in MRP7-transfected cells almost to the level of control cells in the absence of cepharanthine. The efflux of paclitaxel from MRP7-transfected cells was also significantly inhibited by cepharanthine. The ability of cepharanthine to inhibit MRP7 was analyzed in membrane vesicle assays using E(2)17betaG, an established substrate of MRP7, as a probe. E(2)17betaG transport was competitively inhibited by cepharanthine with a K(i) value of 4.86microM.

Whereas some detail on the resistance profile of MRP7 is known, the activities of the pump have not been completely determined. Here, it is shown by the analysis of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells that, in addition to natural product agents, MRP7 is also able to confer resistance to nucleoside-based agents, such as the anticancer agents cytarabine (Ara-C) and gemcitabine, and the antiviral agents 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and PMEA. Consistent with the operation of an efflux pump, expression of MRP7 reduced the accumulation of Ara-C and PMEA. In addition, MRP7 is also able to confer resistance to the microtubule-stabilizing agent epothilone B. Ectopic expression of MRP7 in mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in P-glycoprotein and Mrp1 revealed that MRP7 has a broad resistance profile for natural product agents. In this drug-sensitive cellular background, MRP7 conferred high levels of resistance to docetaxel (46-fold), paclitaxel (116-fold), SN-38 (65-fold), daunorubicin (7.5-fold), etoposide (11-fold), and vincristine (56-fold). Buthionine sulfoximine did not attenuate MRP7-conferred resistance to docetaxel or Ara-C. These experiments indicate that the resistance capabilities of MRP7 include nucleoside-based agents and a range of natural product anticancer agents that includes nontaxane antimicrotubule agents that are not susceptible to P-glycoprotein-mediated transport and that, unlike MRP1 and MRP2, MRP7-mediated drug transport does not involve glutathione."""

Unexpectedly, we found DMRP to exhibit an extremely high turnover rate for the substrate transport as compared to its human orthologues. Furthermore, DMRP showed remarkably high basal ATPase activity (68-75 nmol Pi/mg membrane protein/min), which could be further stimulated by probenecid and the glutathione conjugate of N-ethylmaleimide. Surprisingly, this high level basal ATPase activity was inhibited by the transported substrates.

To screen for new retinal candidate genes that could be involved in the inhibition of ocular growth, we used chick microarrays to analyze the changes in retinal mRNA expression after myopic defocus was imposed by positive lens wear.\n\nMETHODS: Four male white leghorn chicks, aged nine days, wore +6.9D spectacle lenses over both eyes for 24 h. Four untreated age-matched male chicks from the same batch served as controls. The chicks were euthanized, and retinas from both eyes of each chick were pooled. RNA was isolated and labeled cRNA was prepared. These samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome arrays with more than 28,000 characterized genes. After comparison of multiple normalization methods, GC-RMA and a false-discovery rate of 6% was chosen for normalization of the data. The expression of 16 candidate genes was further studied, using semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the expression of the mRNA of some of these candidate genes was assessed in chicks that wore either +6.9D lenses for 4 h or -7D lenses for 24 h.\n\nRESULTS: 123 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed (p<0.05; at least 1.5-fold change in expression level), with an absolute mean fold-change of 1.97+/-1.16 (mean+/-standard deviation). Nine of the sixteen genes that were examined by real-time RT-PCR were validated. Regardless of whether positive or negative lenses were worn, six of these nine genes were regulated in the same direction after 24 h: arginyltransferase 1 (ATE1), E74-like factor 1 (ELF1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), SHQ1 homolog (S. cerevisiae) (SHQ1), spectrin, beta, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), prepro-urotensin II-related peptide (pp-URP). Three genes responded differently to positive and negative lens treatment after 24 h: ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C, member 10 (ABCC10), CD226 molecule (CD226) and oxysterol binding protein 2 (OSBP2).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The validated genes that were regulated only by myopic defocus may represent elements in a pathway generating a ""stop-signal"" for eye growth. Some of the genes identified in this study have so far not been described in the retina. Further investigation of their function may improve the understanding of the signaling cascades in emmetropization. More general, published microarray data are variable among different animal models (mouse, chick, monkeys), tissues (retina, retina/retinal pigment epithelium), treatments (diffusers, lenses, lid-suture), as well as different treatment durations (hours, days), and comparisons remain difficult. That only a small number of common genes were found emphasizes the need for careful normalization of the experimental parameters.'"
ABCC10,18691054,"'Human ABCC10 contains 49 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes and the multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP1/ABCC1, MRP2/ABCC2, MRP3/ABCC3, MRP4/ABCC4, MRP5/ABCC5, MRP6/ABCC6, MRP7/ABCC10, MRP8/ABCC11 and MRP9/ABCC12) belong to the ABCC family which contains 13 members. ABCC7 is cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ABCC8 and ABCC9 are the sulfonylurea receptors which constitute the ATP-sensing subunits of a complex potassium channel. MRP10/ABCC13 is clearly a pseudo-gene which encodes a truncated protein that is highly expressed in fetal human liver with the highest similarity to MRP2/ABCC2 but without transporting activity. These transporters are localized to the apical and/or basolateral membrane of the hepatocytes, enterocytes, renal proximal tubule cells and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. MRP/ABCC members transport a structurally diverse array of important endogenous substances and xenobiotics and their metabolites (in particular conjugates) with different substrate specificity and transport kinetics. The human MRP/ABCC transporters except MRP9/ABCC12 are all able to transport organic anions, such as drugs conjugated to glutathione, sulphate or glucuronate. In addition, selected MRP/ABCC members may transport a variety of endogenous compounds, such as leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4) by MRP1/ABCC1), bilirubin glucuronides (MRP2/ABCC2, and MRP3/ABCC3), prostaglandins E1 and E2 (MRP4/ABCC4), cGMP (MRP4/ABCC4, MRP5/ABCC5, and MRP8/ABCC11), and several glucuronosyl-, or sulfatidyl steroids. In vitro, the MRP/ABCC transporters can collectively confer resistance to natural product anticancer drugs and their conjugated metabolites, platinum compounds, folate antimetabolites, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, arsenical and antimonial oxyanions, peptide-based agents, and in concert with alterations in phase II conjugating or biosynthetic enzymes, classical alkylating agents, alkylating agents. Several MRP/ABCC members (MRPs 1-3) are associated with tumor resistance which is often caused by an increased efflux and decreased intracellular accumulation of natural product anticancer drugs and other anticancer agents. Drug targeting of these transporters to overcome MRP/ABCC-mediated multidrug resistance may play a role in cancer chemotherapy. Most MRP/ABCC transporters are subject to inhibition by a variety of compounds. Based on currently available preclinical and limited clinical data, it can be expected that modulation of MRP members may represent a useful approach in the management of anticancer and antimicrobial drug resistance and possibly of inflammatory diseases and other diseases. A better understanding of their substrates and inhibitors has important implications in development of drugs for treatment of cancer and inflammation.'"
ABCC10,18445659,"'We used the paclitaxel-resistant human small cell lung cancer subline PC-6/TAX1-1, selected from PC-6 cells by paclitaxel, to test whether MRP7/ABCC10 (ABCC10) confers paclitaxel resistance. We found that gene expression of both ABCB1/MDR1 (ABCB1) and ABCC10 was higher in PC-6/TAX1-1 cells than in PC-6 cells. The expression levels of ABCC10 showed a significant inverse correlation with paclitaxel sensitivity (r = 0.574; P < 0.05) in 17 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells unlike the expression levels of ABCB1. Pretreatment with the ABCC10 inhibitor sulfinpyrazone altered the sensitivity to paclitaxel in ABCC10-expressing NSCLC cells, concomitant with increased intracellular paclitaxel accumulation. These findings suggest that expression of the ABCC10 gene is induced by paclitaxel and that ABCC10 confers paclitaxel resistance by enhancing the efflux for paclitaxel. To confirm this hypothesis, we tested the effect on paclitaxel cytotoxicity of decreasing the expression of ABCC10 by small interfering RNA and found that this enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in NCI-H23 cells concomitant with increased intracellular paclitaxel accumulation. These data indicate that ABCC10 may be one of the biomarkers for paclitaxel resistance in NSCLC.'"

The transcript level of endothelial cell markers, such as CD31, Tie-2, claudin-5, occludin, ABCB1a/mdr1a, and ABCG2, were more than 20-fold higher than those in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that RVEC in the RVEC fraction are concentrated at least 20-fold compared with those of the non-RVEC fraction. In the ABCA1 to A9 families, the transcript level of ABCA3 and A9 in the RVEC fraction was 1.2- and 32-fold higher than that in the non-RVEC fraction. Although ABCA3 was expressed in both the RVEC and non-RVEC fractions, A9 is predominantly expressed in the RVEC fraction. In the ABCC1 to C6 and C10 families, the transcript level of ABCC3, C4, and C6 in the RVEC fraction was 27-, 251-, and 242-fold higher, respectively, than that in the non-RVEC fraction, suggesting that ABCC3, C4, and C6 are predominantly expressed in the RVEC.

We used a vinca alkaloid anticancer drug, vincristine (VCR), as a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug. To determine the cause of multidrug resistance, Western blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry of xenografted tumors in nude mice, drug efflux analysis, and drug efflux inhibitory assays were performed. VCR-treated cell lines, Sq-1979/VCR, SCCHA/VCR, NR-PG/VCR, and HSY/VCR, intensively expressed multidrug resistance (MDR) gene 1 mRNA and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) 1 mRNA. MRP7 mRNA and protein were expressed in NR-PG/VCR and HSY/VCR cells, but not in Sq-1979/VCR and SCCHA/VCR cells. In each cell clone of NR-PG/VCR and HSY/VCR, MRP7 mRNA was induced by VCR treatment, suggesting an acquired resistance to VCR in the context of MRP7 expression. In the in vivo chemotherapeutic nude mice model, VCR-treated xenografted SCCHA and HSY cells expressed MDR1 and MRP1. Moreover, MRP7 expression was immunohistochemically found in xenografted HSY cells of VCR-injected tumor-bearing mice, but not in SCCHA cells. Furthermore, doxorubicin accumulation was increased and drug cross-resistance to docetaxel decreased in HSY/VCR in the presence of a competitive MRP7 inhibitor, 17-beta-estradiol-(17-beta-D-glucuronide). These results indicate that MDR1 expression, MRP1 expression, and MRP7 expression are refractory factors in head and neck cancer chemotherapy and suggest that induction of MRP7 expression is involved in drug resistance to natural products, especially to docetaxel in SGA.'"

Of these proteins, a physiological function has only been established for MRP8, for which a single nucleotide polymorphism determines wet vs dry earwax type. MRP7 and MRP8 are lipophilic anion pumps that are able to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. MRP7 is competent in the transport of the glucuronide E(2)17betaG, and its resistance profile, which includes several natural product anticancer agents, is distinguished by the taxane docetaxel. MRP8 is able to transport a diverse range of lipophilic anions, including cyclic nucleotides, E(2)17betaG, steroid sulfates such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) and E(1)S, glutathione conjugates such as leukotriene C4 and dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, and monoanionic bile acids. However, the constituent of earwax that is susceptible to transport by MRP8 has not been identified. MRP8 has complex interactions with its substrates, as indicated by the nonreciprocal ability of DHEAS to stimulate E(2)17betaG transport. Similar to the case for other MRPs that possess only two membrane spanning domains (MRP4 and MRP5), MRP8 is a cyclic nucleotide efflux pump that is able to confer resistance to nucleoside-based agents, such as PMEA and 5FU.

ABCC10,16857811,"'BACKGROUND: A major issue in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Multidrug resistance can be caused by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that function as drug efflux pumps. The majority of these proteins have not yet been examined in malignant diseases.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A newly developed microarray for the simultaneous quantification of 38 ABC transporter genes and Taqman real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of ABC transporters in pediatric AML and healthy bone marrow. Small interfering RNA was used to verify the role of ABCA3 in drug resistance.\n\nRESULTS: Using the microarray, we identified four new ABC transporters, which were overexpressed in many AML samples compared with healthy bone marrow: ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCB2, and ABCC10. The overexpression of these four genes was verified by real-time PCR in 42 samples from children with AML and 18 samples of healthy bone marrow. The median expression of ABCA3 was three times higher in 21 patients who had failed to achieve remission after the first course of chemotherapy than in a well-matched group of 21 patients who had achieved remission at this stage (P = 0.023). Incubation of cell lines with a number of different cytostatic drugs induced an up-regulation of ABCA3. Down-regulation of ABCA3 by small interfering RNA sensitized cells to doxorubicin.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCB2, and ABCC10 are overexpressed in childhood AML compared with healthy bone marrow.

Standardized RT (StaRT)-PCR, was employed to assess these genes in a set of NSCLC cell lines with a previously published range of sensitivity to cisplatin. Data were obtained in the form of target gene molecules relative to 106 beta-actin (ACTB) molecules. To cancel the effect of ACTB variation among the different cell lines individual gene expression values were incorporated into ratios of one gene to another. Each two-gene ratio was compared as a single variable to chemoresistance for each of eight NSCLC cell lines using multiple regression. In an effort to validate these results, six additional lines then were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Following validation, single variable models best correlated with chemoresistance (p < 0.001), were ERCC2/XPC, ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2, XPA/XPC and XRCC1/XPC. All single variable models were examined hierarchically to achieve two variable models. The two variable model with the highest correlation was (ABCC5/GTF2H2, ERCC2/GTF2H2) with an R2 value of 0.96 (p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: These results provide markers suitable for assessment of small fine needle aspirate biopsies in an effort to prospectively identify cisplatin resistant tumors.'"

ABCC10,15474296,"""Studies focusing on the transcriptional regulation of MRP7 (multidrug resistance associated protein 7) gene expression in human tumor cells are described. As shown by real-time RT-PCR, expression of the MRP7 gene compared to the expression of the MRP1, 2 and 3 genes was less variable among the different cell types. MRP1, 2, 3 and 7 gene expression was highest in HepG2 cells compared to expression in CWR22Rv1 and TSU-PR1 cells. MRP7 gene expression was less than expression of the MRP1 and 2 genes in HepG2 cells but similar to MRP3 gene expression in this cell type and similar to or greater than expression of the MRP1, 2 and 3 genes in CWR22Rv1 and TSU-PR1 cells. Functional deletion analysis, in situ mutagenesis and electromobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that basal MRP7 promoter activity relied upon a proximal segment of the 5' flanking region 169 to 257 nt in length bearing an E2F site acting cooperatively with two closely positioned Sp1 sites. Two additional Sp1 sites further downstream were of secondary importance. The sequence of the E2F site was noncanonical and its interaction with E2F protein was confirmed by a competitive EMSA using a consensus E2F oligonucleotide probe and by demonstrating a supershift with the antibody against the E2F4 and E2F5 pocket protein, p107. 5' RACE carried out with CWR22Rv1 and HepG2 cells detected a single transcription start site (tsp) distal to the basal promoter and identified two new MRP7 transcripts with very short 5' UTR sequences compared to transcripts found by others in nontumorous human tissue.

In addition, lower levels of resistance were observed for paclitaxel (3-fold), vincristine (3-fold), and vinblastine (3-4-fold). Consistent with the operation of an ATP-dependent efflux pump, MRP7-transfected cells exhibited reduced accumulation of radiolabeled paclitaxel compared with HEK293 cells transfected with parental plasmid.

No RNA or protein upregulation was observed for ABCB6, ABCF1, ABCC10, ABCC4, ABCB2 and ABCB3, but an increased expression was detected for ABCA2 mRNA in GLC4-MITO. ABCA2 is known to be involved in resistance to estramustine. In the MTT assay, GLC4-MITO was two-fold resistant to estramustine compared to GLC4. Coincubation with estramustine and mitoxantrone increased mitoxantrone accumulation in GLC4-MITO, while this was not affected in GLC4. This suggests that estramustine is able to block mitoxantrone efflux in GLC4-MITO cells.

ABCC10,12527806,"'Human multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10) is a recently described member of the C family of ATP binding cassette proteins (Cancer Lett 162:181-191, 2001). However, neither its biochemical activity nor physiological functions have been determined. Here we report the results of investigations of the in vitro transport properties of MRP7 using membrane vesicles prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with MRP7 expression vector. It is shown that expression of MRP7 is specifically associated with the MgATP-dependent transport of 17beta-estradiol-(17-beta-D-glucuronide) (E(2)17betaG). E(2)17betaG transport was saturable, with K(m) and V(max) values of 57.8 +/- 15 microM and 53.1 +/- 20 pmol/mg/min. By contrast, with E(2)17betaG, only modest enhancement of LTC(4) transport was observed and transport of several other established substrates of MRP family transporters was not detectable to any extent. In accord with the notion that MRP7 has a bipartite substrate binding pocket composed of sites for anionic and lipophilic moieties, transport of E(2)17betaG was susceptible to competitive inhibition by both amphiphiles, such as leukotriene C(4) (K(i(app)), 1.5 microM), glycolithocholate 3-sulfate (K(i(app)), 34.2 microM) and MK571 (K(i(app)), 28.5 microM), and lipophilic agents such as cyclosporine A (K(i(app)), 14.4 microM). Of the inhibitors tested, LTC(4) was the most potent, in agreement with the possibility that it is a substrate of the pump. The determination that MRP7 has the facility for mediating the transport of conjugates such as E(2)17betaG indicates that it is a lipophilic anion transporter involved in phase III (cellular extrusion) of detoxification.'"

MRP1 and MRP5 are abundant in almost every organ and are prominently present in the brain. High levels of MRP1 are present in the epithelium of the choroid plexus. Using mutant mice lacking a functional Mrp1 gene, we have previously shown the contribution of MRP1 to the blood-CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) drug permeability barrier.

In this report the predicted coding sequence, protein product and expression pattern of this cDNA, termed MRP7, are analyzed. The MRP7 cDNA sequence encodes a 1492 amino acid ABC transporter whose structural architecture resembles that of MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6, in that its transmembrane helices are arranged in three membrane spanning domains. However, in contrast to the latter transporters, a conserved N-linked glycosylation site is not found at the N-terminus of MRP7. Comparisons of the MRP7 amino acid sequence indicated that while it is most closely related to other MRP subfamily members, its degree of relatedness is the lowest of any of the known MRP-related transporters. The integrity of the predicted MRP7 coding sequence was confirmed by the synthesis of an approximately 158 kDa protein in reticulocyte lysates programmed with the MRP7 cDNA. While MRP7 transcript was detected in a variety of tissues by RT/PCR, it was not readily detectable by RNA blot analysis, suggesting that it is expressed at low levels in these tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that MRP7 maps to chromosome 6p12-21, in proximity to several genes associated with glutathione conjugation and synthesis.

Thus, toxicological studies are needed to examine chemicals that might be implicated. However, the experimental efficiency of existing experimental models is limited, and many models represent challenges in terms of animal welfare. Thus, alternative ASD animal models are necessary. To address this, we examined the efficacy of the zebrafish embryo/larva as an alternative model of ASD. Specifically, we exposed zebrafish to valproic acid (0, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μM), which is a chemical known to induce autism-like effects. We then analysed subsequent developmental, behavioural, and transcriptomic changes. We found that 100 μM and 50 μM valproic acid decreased the hatching rate and locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos/larvae. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in a number of genes associated with autism, such as adsl, mbd5, shank3, and tsc1b.

The SNP G10696A located in exon10 was significantly associated with carcass rate, in which AA and AB genotype were higher than the BB genotype (P\xa0<\xa00.01). 4. The results indicated that the ADSL gene has a close association with meat quality and carcass traits in domestic pigeons, and G10696A and C13065G SNPs could be applied as genetic markers in molecular marker-assisted breeding of pigeons.'"
ADSL,29780325,"'The storage of erythrocyte concentrates (ECs) induces lesions that notably ABCC10 affect metabolism, protein activity, deformability of red blood cells (RBCs), as well as the release of oxygen. Band 3 is one of the proteins affected during the  aging of RBCs. This membrane protein is an anion transporter, an anchor site for the cytoskeleton and other membrane proteins as well as a binding site for glycolytic enzymes and bears blood group antigens. In the present study, band 3 complexes were isolated from RBCs stored for 7 and 42 days in average ( = 3), as well as from microvesicles ( = 3). After extraction of membrane proteins with a deoxycholate containing buffer, band 3 complexes were co-immunoprecipitated on magnetic beads coated with two anti-band 3 antibodies. Both total membrane protein extracts and eluates (containing band 3 complexes) were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by bottom-up proteomics. It revealed that three proteins were present or absent in band 3 complexes stemming from long-stored or short-stored ECs, respectively, whereas the membrane protein contents remained equivalent. These potential markers for storage-induced RBC aging are adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), α-adducin and flotillin-2, and were further analyzed using western blots. ADSL abundance tended to increase during storage in both total membrane protein and band 3 complexes, whereas α-adducin mainly tended to stay onto the membrane extract. Interestingly, flotillin-2 was equivalently present in total membrane proteins whereas it clearly co-immunoprecipitated with band 3 complexes during storage (1.6-fold-change,  = 0.0024). Moreover, flotillin-2 was enriched (almost threefold) in RBCs compared to microvesicles (MVs) ( < 0.001) and the amount found in MVs was associated to band 3 complexes. Different types of band 3 complexes are known to exist in RBCs and further studies will be required to better understand involvement of this protein in microvesiculation during the storage of RBCs.'"
ADSL,29467457,"'Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is an enzyme that plays important roles in de novo purine synthesis. Although ADSL was reported to be upregulated in various malignancies, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, as well as gliomas, the mechanism by which elevated ADSL expression contributes to cancer has not been elucidated. We previously performed a shotgun proteomics analysis to characterize specific proteins associated with the properties of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-high cell population, which was reported to be involved in tumorigenic potential, and showed that ADSL expression is upregulated in the ALDH-high population of endometrial cancer. Here, we showed that ADSL is involved in endometrial cancer aggressiveness by regulating expression of killer cell lectin-like receptor C3 (KLRC3), which is a receptor expressed on natural killer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that ADSL expression increased as endometrioid carcinoma specimens became more poorly differentiated and higher degree of primary tumor progression. Knockdown of ADSL in endometrial cancer cells decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasive capability, and caused the cells to adopt a more rounded shape. DNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR showed that KLRC3 expression was decreased in ADSL knockdown cells. Knockdown of KLRC3 in endometrial cancer cells resulted in the same phenotype as knockdown of ADSL. Moreover, fumarate, which could be produced by ADSL and was recently shown to be an oncometabolite, recovered KLRC3 expression in ADSL knockdown cells, suggesting that fumarate produced by ADSL could regulate KLRC3 expression. Our findings indicate that ADSL enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasive capability through regulation of KLRC3 expression by fumarate.'"
ADSL,28768552,"'BACKGROUND: Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency is a defect of purine metabolism affecting purinosome assembly and reducing metabolite fluxes through purine de novo synthesis and purine nucleotide recycling pathways. The disorder shows a wide spectrum of symptoms from slowly to rapidly progressing forms. The most severe form is characterized by neonatal encephalopathy, absence of spontaneous movement, respiratory failure, intractable seizures, and early death within the first weeks of life. More commonly, ADSL presents purely neurologic clinical picture characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, early onset of seizures, and autistic features (type I) or a more slowly progressing form with later onset, and major features including slight to moderate psychomotor retardation, and transient contact disturbances (type II). Diagnostic markers are the presence of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (SAdo) in extracellular fluids. ADSL is a rare disorder, although its prevalence remains unknown. Of note, the wide range of essentially nonspecific manifestations and lack of awareness of the condition often prevent diagnosis.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present here the case of particularly mild, late onset ADSL that has been unsuccessfully investigated until whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Besides emphasizing the valuable diagnostic value of WES, this report provides new data further documenting the relatively wide clinical manifestation of ADSL.'"
ADSL,28535982,"'We reported previously that monoamine oxidase (MAO) A knockout (KO) mice show increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels and autistic-like behaviors characterized by repetitive behaviors, and anti-social behaviors. We showed that administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor para-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) from post-natal day 1 (P1) through 7 (P7) in MAO A KO mice reduced the serotonin level to normal and reverses the repetitive behavior. These results suggested that the altered gene expression at P1 and P7 may be important for the autistic-like behaviors seen in MAO A KO mice and was studied here. In this study, Affymetrix mRNA array data for P1 and P7 MAO A KO mice were analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify genes differentially expressed versus wild-type and assess their functions and relationships. The number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) varied with age: P1 (664) and P7 (3307) [false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05, fold-change (FC) >1.5 for autism-linked genes and >2.0 for functionally categorized genes]. Eight autism-linked genes were differentially expressed in P1 (upregulated: NLGN3, SLC6A2; down-regulated: HTR2C, MET, ADSL, MECP2, ALDH5A1, GRIN3B) while four autism-linked genes were differentially expressed at P7 (upregulated: HTR2B; downregulated: GRIN2D, GRIN2B, CHRNA4). Many other genes involved in neurodevelopment, apoptosis, neurotransmission, and cognitive function were differentially expressed at P7 in MAO A KO mice. This result suggests that modulation of these genes by the increased serotonin may lead to neurodevelopmental alteration in MAO A KO mice and results in autistic-like behaviors.'"

ADSL,28347672,"""Schistosoma mansoni is the parasite responsible for schistosomiasis, a disease that affects about 218 million people worldwide. Currently, both direct treatment and disease control initiatives rely on chemotherapy using a single drug, praziquantel. Concerns over the possibility of resistance developing to praziquantel, have stimulated efforts to develop new drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Schistosomes do not have the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, and instead depend entirely on the purine salvage pathway to supply its need for purines. The purine salvage pathway has been reported as a potential target for developing new drugs against schistosomiasis. Adenylosuccinate lyase (SmADSL) is an enzyme in this pathway, which cleaves adenylosuccinate (ADS) into adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate. SmADSL kinetic characterization was performed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using both ADS and SAICAR as substrates. Structures of SmADSL in Apo form and in complex with AMP were elucidated by x-ray crystallography revealing a highly conserved tetrameric structure required for their function since the active sites are formed from residues of three different subunits. The active sites are also highly conserved between species and it is difficult to identify a potent species-specific inhibitor for the development of new therapeutic agents. In contrast, several mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the importance of dimeric interface residues in the stability of the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The lower conservation of these residues between SmADSL and human ADSL could be used to lead the development of anti-schistosomiasis drugs based on disruption of subunit interfaces. These structures and kinetics data add another layer of information to Schistosoma mansoni purine salvage pathway."""

The ADSL gene produces an enzyme with binary molecular roles in de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide recycling. The biochemical phenotype of ADSL deficiency, accumulation of SAICAr and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in biofluids of affected individuals, serves as the traditional target for diagnosis with targeted quantitative urine purine analysis employed as the predominate method of detection. In this study, we report the diagnosis of ADSL deficiency using an alternative method, untargeted metabolomic profiling, an analytical scheme capable of generating semi-quantitative z-score values for over 1000 unique compounds in a single analysis of a specimen. Using this method to analyze plasma, we diagnosed ADSL deficiency in four patients and confirmed these findings with targeted quantitative biochemical analysis and molecular genetic testing. ADSL deficiency is part of a large a group of neurometabolic disorders, with a wide range of severity and sharing a broad differential diagnosis. This phenotypic similarity among these many inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) has classically stood as a hurdle in their initial diagnosis and subsequent treatment. The findings presented here demonstrate the clinical utility of metabolomic profiling in the diagnosis of ADSL deficiency and highlights the potential of this technology in the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with neurologic phenotypes.'"

ADSL,27440870,"'Essential genes refer to those whose null mutation leads to lethality or sterility. Theoretical reasoning and empirical data both suggest that the fatal effect of inactivating an essential gene can be attributed to either the loss of indispensable core cellular function (Type I), or the gain of fatal side effects after losing dispensable periphery function (Type II). In principle, inactivation of Type I essential genes can be rescued only by re-gain of the core functions, whereas inactivation of Type II essential genes could be rescued by a further loss of function of another gene to eliminate the otherwise fatal side effects. Because such loss-of-function rescuing mutations may occur spontaneously, Type II essential genes may become nonessential in a few individuals of a large population. Motivated by this reasoning, we here carried out a systematic screening for Type II essentiality in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of essentiality-reversing mutants reveals 14 cases whereby the inactivation of an essential gene is rescued by loss-of-function mutations on another gene. In particular, the essential gene encoding the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is shown to be Type II, suggesting a loss-of-function therapeutic strategy for the human disorder ADSL deficiency.

In this study, we characterized the topological properties of human anticancer drug targets (ADTs) in the context of biological pathways. We found that the ADTs tended to present the following seven topological properties: influence the number of the pathways related to cancer, be localized at the start or end of the pathways, interact with cancer related genes, exhibit higher connectivity, vulnerability, betweenness, and closeness than other genes. We first ranked ADTs based on their topological property values respectively, then fused them into one global-rank using the joint cumulative distribution of an N-dimensional order statistic to optimize human ADTs. We applied the optimization method to 13 anticancer drugs, respectively. Results demonstrated that over 70% of known ADTs were ranked in the top 20%.

The quantification was performed using the isotopically labelled internal standards SAdo-(13)C4 and SAICAr-(13)C4, which were prepared via ADSL-catalysed reactions of fumarate-(13)C4 with adenosine monophosphate and aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide, respectively, and subsequent alkaline phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation of the resulting products.\n\nRESULTS: The detection of SAICAr and SAdo in DBS was linear over the range of 0-25μmol/L. The respective intra-assay and inter-assay imprecision values were less than 10.7% and 15.2% for SAICAr and 4.7% and 5.7% for SAdo. The recoveries from DBS spiked with different concentrations of SAICAr and SAdo were between 94% and 117%. The concentrations of SAICAr and SAdo were higher in the archived DBS from dADSL patients (SAICAr, 0.03-4.7μmol/L; SAdo, 1.5-21.3μmol/L; n=5) compared to those of the control subjects (SAICAr, 0-0.026μmol/L; SAdo, 0.06-0.14μmol/L; n=31), even after DBSs from dADSL patients were stored for 2-23years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a method of succinylpurine analysis in DBS that improves selective screening for dADSL in the paediatric population and may be used for retrospective diagnosis to aid the genetic counselling of affected families.'"

Activating the AMPK is considered as one of the potential therapeutic strategies in treating type-2 diabetes. However, targeting AMPK by small molecule mediated approach can be challenging owing to diverse isoforms of the enzyme and their varied combination in different tissues. In the current study we employ a novel strategy of achieving AMPK activation through increasing the levels of cellular AMP (an allosteric activator of AMPK) levels by activating the enzyme involved in AMP biosynthesis namely Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL).\n\nMETHODS: Rat primary hepatocytes were cultured under metabolic overload conditions (500\xa0μM palmitate) to induce insulin resistance. ADSL was overexpressed in these hepatocytes and its effect on hepatic glucose output, and triglyceride accumulation was checked. In addition to this, ADSL was overexpressed in high fat diet induced obese mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection and its effect on fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and pyruvate tolerance were checked.\n\nRESULTS: Rat primary hepatocytes when cultured under metabolic overload conditions developed insulin resistance as measured in terms of failure of insulin to suppress the glucose output. Overexpressing the ADSL in these hepatocytes resulted in increased AMPK phosporylation and improved the insulin sensitivity and also resulted in reduced triglyceride accumulation and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition to this, when ADSL was overexpressed in high fat diet induced obese mice, it resulted in reduced the fasting hyperglycemia (20% reduction), and increased glucose and pyruvate tolerance.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that activating ADSL can be a potential mechanism to achieve the activation of AMPK in the cells. This leads to a novel idea of exploring the purine nucleotide metabolic pathway as a promising therapeutic target for diabetes and metabolic syndrome.'"
ADSL,24834503,"""Pathogens, which have recently colonized a new host species or new populations of the same host, are interesting models for understanding how populations may evolve in response to novel environments. During its colonization of South America from Africa, Plasmodium falciparum, the main agent of malaria, has been exposed to new conditions in distinctive new human populations (Amerindian and populations of mixed origins) that likely exerted new selective pressures on the parasite's genome. Among the genes that might have experienced strong selective pressures in response to these environmental changes, the eba genes (erythrocyte-binding antigens genes), which are involved in the invasion of the human red blood cells, constitute good candidates. In this study, we analysed, in South America, the polymorphism of three eba genes (eba-140, eba-175, eba-181) and compared it to the polymorphism observed in African populations. The aim was to determine whether these genes faced selective pressures in South America distinct from what they experienced in Africa. Patterns of genetic variability of these genes were compared to the patterns observed at two housekeeping genes (adsl and serca) and 272 SNPs to separate adaptive effects from demographic effects. We show that, conversely to Africa, eba-140 seemed to be under stronger diversifying selection in South America than eba-175. In contrast, eba-181 did not show any sign of departure from neutrality. These changes in the patterns of selection on the eba genes could be the consequence of changes in the host immune response, the host receptor polymorphisms and/or the ability of the parasite to silence or express differentially its invasion proteins."""

Furthermore, it identified a pathogenic maternally inherited Xp11.2 duplication. Targeted sequencing was informative for ARX (n = 1/14) and STXBP1 (n = 1/8). In contrast, sequencing of a panel of 35 known epileptic encephalopathy genes (n = 8) did not identify further mutations. Finally, WES (n = 18) was very informative, with an excess of de novo mutations identified in genes predicted to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes and/or known to be intolerant to functional variations. Several pathogenic mutations were identified, including de novo mutations in STXBP1, CASK and ALG13, as well as recessive mutations in PNPO and ADSL, together explaining 28% of cases (5/18). In addition, WES identified 1-3 de novo variants in 64% of remaining probands, pointing to several interesting candidate genes.

The microdeletion/microduplication syndromes are now easily identified by chromosomal microarray analysis and include Phelan–McDermid syndrome (chromosome 22q13.3 deletion), MBD5 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 2q23.1 deletion), and KANSL1 haploinsufficiency syndrome (chromosome 17q21.31 deletion). The single-gene disorders include Pitt–Hopkins syndrome (TCF4), Christianson syndrome (SLC9A6), Mowat–Wilson syndrome (ZEB2), Kleefstra syndrome (EHMT1), and Rett (MECP2) syndrome. They also include disorders due to mutations in HERC2, adenylosuccinase lyase (ADSL), CDKL5, FOXG1, MECP2 (duplications), MEF2C, and ATRX. Although many of these single-gene disorders can be caused by chromosomal microdeletions resulting in haploinsufficiency of the critical gene, the individual disorders are often caused by intragenic mutations that cannot be detected by chromosomal microarray analysis. We provide an overview of the clinical features of these syndromes, comparing and contrasting them with AS, in the hope that it will help guide clinicians in the diagnostic work-up of individuals with AS-like syndromes.'"
ADSL,24328677,"'CONTEXT: Subcutaneous injection of low dose of phthalates causes adjuvant effects on immunoglobulin production. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) at doses lower than the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) causes aggravation of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions (ADSLs) in mouse models. However, the effects of oral exposure to these phthalates, including their effect on atopic dermatitis (AD) symptoms, remain unclear.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of oral administration of DEHP and DINP at doses lower than the NOAEL on AD in an NC/Nga mouse model.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: NC/Nga mice were subcutaneously injected with mite-allergen (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) to induce ADSLs and orally administered varying doses of DEHP (0, 8.3, 166.3 or 3325\u2009µg/animal) or DINP (0, 6.6, 131.3 or 2625 µg/animal) once a week for four weeks. Skin disease symptomatology was subsequently evaluated and immunoglobulin production levels in serum and inflammatory cytokine levels in lesion sites were measured.\n\nRESULTS: Oral administration of low doses of both DEHP and DINP tended to increase infiltration of eosinophils; degranulation of mast cells and local expression of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-13 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha in subcutaneous tissue, whereas DINP administration tended to aggravate allergen-induced ADSL production.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of both DEHP and DINP at doses lower than the NOAEL tends to increase the allergic response in animal AD models, but only DINP administration slightly aggravates allergen-induced ADSL production.'"
ADSL,28788416,"""The radiopaque dicalcium silicate cement (RDSC) displayed a shortened setting time and good biocompatibility. This study aimed to compare the regenerative potential of RDSC and white-colored mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA) using a rabbit femur model. The animals were sacrificed at one, three and six months to accomplish histological and biochemical analyses. The results indicated that after one month of implantation, WMTA was associated with a greyish color alteration within its mass, while RDSC presented color stability even at six months. Histological assay with Masson's Trichrome and Von Kossa stains showed the presence of newly formed bone surrounding the implanted sites in the rabbit femur. The histochemical data revealed that the RDSC group had significantly more bone regeneration than did the WMTA groups at three and six months. The conclusion drawn is that the encouraging results support the potential applications of RDSC as an improved alternative to WMTA for endodontic uses."""
ADSL,24183879,"""OBJECTIVES: Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (dADSL) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Biochemical diagnosis of the disease is based on the determination of enormously elevated urinary levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) and succinyladenosine (SAdo). We report a case of false negative screening for dADSL caused by deribosylation of the urinary biomarkers SAICA-riboside and SAdo.\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS: A thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method with Pauly reagent detection of SAICA-riboside was used as a screening method. High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) and LC-MS/MS methods were used for the identification and quantitative determination of SAICA-riboside, SAdo, succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide (SAICA) and succinyladenine (SA).\n\nRESULTS: Following a negative TLC screening in a known case of dADSL, we analyzed urine using HPLC-DAD. The concentration of SAICA-riboside was 2.7mmol/mol creatinine (below the TLC detection limit), and we detected the two abnormal metabolites identified by LC-MS/MS as SAICA and SA. We showed that SAICA and SA were produced by deribosylation of SAICA-riboside and SAdo in the patient's urine. Studies performed by monitoring the production of SAICA and SA after the addition of SAICA-riboside and SAdo to the patient's urine and to urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections suggested that deribosylation is facilitated by bacterial enzymes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Screening methods for the diagnosis of dADSL may be falsely negative due to bacteria-mediated deribosylation of SAICA-riboside and SAdo. HPLC-DAD or LC-MS/MS analyses allowing for simultaneous detection of SAICA-riboside, SAdo and their deribosylation products SAICA and SA should be preferentially used for the diagnosis of dADSL in urine."""

However, the effects of alkylphenols (used as plasticizers and surfactants) on atopic dermatitis have not been studied in detail. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of the alkylphenols 4-nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP) and 4-tert-butylphenol (BP) in a murine model of atopic dermatitis. NC/Nga mice were intraperitoneally administered NP, OP or BP and were subcutaneously injected with mite allergen in one ear to induce atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions (ADSLs). The condition of the skin was observed, and the levels of immunoglobulin in serum and inflammatory cytokines in lesions were determined. NP exacerbated mite allergen-induced ADSLs according to dose. OP and BP also significantly exacerbated skin lesions but not as a function of dose. Alkylphenols tended to increase the levels of IgE and antigen-specific IgG1 in serum. Further, the treatment of the alkylphenols increased the expression in lesions of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-4 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin levels increased according to ADSL severity. In contrast, the levels of the T-helper 1 cytokines (interleukin-18 and interferon-gamma) decreased. NP, OP or BP may enhance T-helper 2-type immune responses in NC/Nga mice, which aggravates mite allergen-induced ADSLs. Therefore, the uptake of very low levels of alkylphenols may contribute to the increase in the incidence of atopic dermatitis.'"

We prospectively evaluated short term tolerance of treatment with special emphasis on sleep quality.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with a first event of presumed demyelinating disease (CIS), multiple sclerosis relapses (MS) or sub-acute disease progression were treated with a 5-day regimen of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in our inpatient clinic. Patients' experience was documented by self-report questionnaires including a standardised depression scale (ADSL). Laboratory tests were performed on a routine basis. Fasting glucose, blood pressure and pulse were measured before every infusion. Activity and sleep patterns were analysed by wrist actigraphs during the 5 day infusion period and at follow-up after 1-2 months.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 66 patients participated in the study. Of these, 55 were steroid treatment naïve, and 11 patients, who had received intravenous steroid relapse treatment before, were admitted because of disabling symptoms. Mood disturbances were reported before steroid treatment, however significantly less often at the end of the steroid pulse and during follow-up. Sleep efficiency as measured by wrist actimetry was high before, during and after steroid treatment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Therapy was well tolerated without severe side effects in CIS and MS patients. Sleep efficiency was not disturbed. In conclusion there are no obstacles to change from an inpatient to an outpatient setting for the steroid treatment of relapses in MS and CIS, but rare psychotic reactions to steroid treatment are not predictable."""
ADSL,23714113,"'Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is a homotetrameric enzyme involved in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and purine nucleotide cycle. Missense mutations in the protein lead to ADSL deficiency, an inborn error of purine metabolism characterized by neurological and physiological symptoms. ADSL deficiency is biochemically diagnosed by elevated levels of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), the dephosphorylated derivatives of the substrates. S-Ado/SAICAr ratios have been associated with three phenotypic groups. Different hypotheses to explain these ratios have been proposed. Recent studies have focused on measuring activity on the substrates independently. However, it is important to examine mixtures of the substrates to determine if mutations affect enzyme activity on both substrates similarly in these conditions. The two substrates may experience an indirect communication due to being acted upon by the same enzyme, altering their activities from the non-competitive case. In this study, we investigate this hidden coupling between the two substrates. We chose two mutations that represent extremes of the phenotype, R426H and R303C. We describe a novel electrochemical-detection method of measuring the kinetic activity of ADSL in solution with its two substrates at varying concentration ratios. Furthermore, we develop an enzyme kinetic model to predict substrate activity from a given ratio of substrate concentrations. Our findings indicate a non-linear dependence of the activities on the substrate ratios due to competitive binding, distinct differences in the behaviors of the different mutations, and S-Ado/SAICAr ratios in patients could be explained by inherent properties of the mutant enzyme.'"
ADSL,23622405,"'The purines are a group of molecules used by all cells for many vital biochemical processes including energy-requiring enzymatic reactions, cofactor-requiring reactions, synthesis of DNA or RNA, signaling pathways within and between cells, and other processes. Defects in some of the enzymes of purine metabolism are known to be associated with specific clinical disorders, and neurological problems may be a presenting sign or the predominant clinical problem for several of them. This chapter describes three disorders for which the clinical features and metabolic basis are well characterized. Deficiency of adenylosuccinate-lyase (ADSL) causes psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and autistic features. Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and is characterized by hyperuricemia, motor and cognitive disability, and self-injurious behavior. Deficiency of myoadenylate deaminase (mAMPD) is associated with myopathic features. In addition to these disorders, several other disorders are briefly summarized. These include defects of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase, adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PND), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), or IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Each of these disorders provides an unusual window on the unique importance of purine metabolism for function of different parts of the nervous system.'"

Alterations in PAICS expression in humans have been associated with various types of cancer. Mutations in adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL, E.C. 4.3.2.2) or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC, E.C. 2.1.2.3/E.C. 3.5.4.10) lead to inborn errors of metabolism with a range of clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, severe neurological symptoms, and autistic features. The pathogenetic mechanism is unknown for these conditions, and no effective treatments exist. The study of cells carrying mutations in the various de novo purine biosynthesis pathway genes provides one approach to analysis of purine disorders. Here we report the characterization of AdeD Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which carry genetic mutations encoding p.E177K and p.W363* variants of PAICS. Both mutations impact PAICS structure and completely abolish its biosynthesis. Additionally, we describe a sensitive and rapid analytical method for detection of purine de novo biosynthesis intermediates based on high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Using this technique we detected accumulation of AIR in AdeD cells. In AdeI cells, mutant for the ADSL gene, we detected accumulation of SAICAR and SAMP and, somewhat unexpectedly, accumulation of AIR. This method has great potential for metabolite profiling of de novo purine biosynthesis pathway mutants, identification of novel genetic defects of purine metabolism in humans, and elucidating the regulation of this critical metabolic pathway.'"

ADSL,22908986,"""BACKGROUND: Providing remote health monitoring to specific groups of patients represents an issue of great relevance for the national health systems, because of the costs related to moving health operators, the time spent to reach remote sites, and the high number of people needing health assistance. At the same time, some assistance activities, like those related to chronical diseases, may be satisfied through a remote interaction with the patient, without a direct medical examination.\n\nMETHODS: Moving from this considerations, our paper proposes a system architecture for the provisioning of remote health assistance to older adults, based on a blind management of a network of wireless medical devices, and an interactive TV Set Top Box for accessing health related data. The selection of TV as the interface between the user and the system is specifically targeted to older adults. Due to the private nature of the information exchanged, a certified procedure is implemented for data delivery, through the use of non conditional smart cards. All these functions may be accomplished through a proper design of the system management, and a suitable interactive application.\n\nRESULTS: The interactive application acting as the interface between the user and the system on the TV monitor has been evaluated able to help readability and clear understanding of the contents and functions proposed. Thanks to the limited amount of data to transfer, even a Set Top Box equipped with a traditional PSTN modem may be used to support the proposed service at a basic level; more advanced features, like audio/video connection, may be activated if the Set Top Box enables a broadband connection (e.g. ADSL).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed layered architecture for a remote health monitoring system can be tailored to address a wide range of needs, according with each patient's conditions and capabilities.

ADSL,22812634,"""Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which causes a defect in purine metabolism resulting in neurological and physiological symptoms. ADSL executes two nonsequential steps in the de novo synthesis of AMP: the conversion of phosphoribosylsuccinyl-aminoimidazole carboxamide (SAICAR) to phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxamide, which occurs in the de novo synthesis of IMP, and the conversion of adenylosuccinate to AMP, which occurs in the de novo synthesis of AMP and also in the purine nucleotide cycle, using the same active site. Mutation of ADSL's arginine 303 to a cysteine is known to lead to ADSL deficiency. Interestingly, unlike other mutations leading to ADSL deficiency, the R303C mutation has been suggested to more significantly affect the enzyme's ability to catalyze the conversion of succinyladenosine monophosphate than that of SAICAR to their respective products. To better understand the causation of disease due to the R303C mutation, as well as to gain insights into why the R303C mutation potentially has a disproportional decrease in activity toward its substrates, the wild type (WT) and the R303C mutant of ADSL were investigated enzymatically and thermodynamically. Additionally, the X-ray structures of ADSL in its apo form as well as with the R303C mutation were elucidated, providing insight into ADSL's cooperativity.

Our results thus shown that the assembly of functional purinosomes is fully dependent on the presence of structurally unaffected ATIC and ADSL complexes and presumably also on the presence of all the other DNPS proteins. The results also corroborate the hypothesis that the phenotypic severity of ADSL deficiency is mainly determined by structural stability and residual catalytic capacity of the corresponding mutant ADSL protein complexes, as this is prerequisite for the formation and stability of the purinosome and at least partial channeling of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside-ADSL enzyme substrates-through the DNPS pathway.'"

This suggests that nucleotides and nucleosides play fundamental but still unknown roles in the development and function of several organs, in particular central nervous system. Alterations of purine and pyrimidine metabolism affecting brain function are spread along both synthesis (PRPS, ADSL, ATIC, HPRT, UMPS, dGK, TK), and breakdown pathways (5NT, ADA, PNP, GCH, DPD, DHPA, TP, UP), sometimes also involving pyridine metabolism. Explanations for the pathogenesis of disorders may include both cellular and mitochondrial damage: e.g. deficiency of the purine salvage enzymes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and deoxyguanosine kinase are associated to the most severe pathologies, the former due to an unexplained adverse effect exerted on the development and/or differentiation of dopaminergic neurons, the latter due to impairment of mitochondrial functions.

The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within the ADSL (adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency) gene and GARS-AIRS-GART (glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase-glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase) gene with the content of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) was studied in a population of male Beijing-you (BJY) chickens slaughtered at 90 d of age. 2. A single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 of the ADSL gene had an effect on IMP content. Chickens inheriting the positive allele at ADSL, both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, had a higher content of IMP in breast muscle than did individuals without it. 3. Similar results were obtained for the GARS-AIRS-GART gene. The marker at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the GARS-AIRS-GART gene was also significant for the IMP value. Chickens inheriting the genotypes with the positive allele at this locus had a much higher content of IMP than did those homozygous for the unfavourable one. 4. Interactions between ADSL and GARS-AIRS-GART were detected for such traits as body weight and muscle yields in the tested population. The two loci acted in an additive fashion. Because IMP is one of the most important flavour components in meat, markers developed at these two genes, as well as the combination genotypes, could be used as potential molecular markers for improving chicken quality."""

However, these systems are not in common use because few evaluations on their efficiency and economic viability were reported.\n\nMETHODS: We constructed an easy-to-use asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)-based live interactive teleconsultation system and conducted 150 trial sessions between two rural hospitals and Shimane University Hospital. The clinical usefulness and economic advantages of this system were evaluated using data obtained from the trials.\n\nRESULTS: The system efficiently captured images at a resolution sufficient for specialized consultations: follicular openings were visible in the images obtained from a distance of 2 m. This system is more advantageous than a conventional clinic if the following condition is fulfilled: y ≤ 6.00 x-3.86 [x, time required for one-way travel (h); y, time required for consultation (h)]. Our two lines in trial fulfilled this condition.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Asymmetric digital subscriber line-based live interactive teleconsultation technology is beneficial in many rural hospitals that do not have a dermatologist.'"
ADSL,20961233,"'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of targeted narrowband UVB phototherapy plus topical tetrahydrocurcuminoid with that of targeted narrowband UVB monotherapy for induction of repigmentation in vitiligo.\n\nBACKGROUND DATA: The 308-nm excimer laser and targeted narrowband UVB phototherapy have recently been shown to be effective in repigmenting vitiligo. Studies have suggested that the combination of the 308-nm excimer laser and various topical treatments is more effective than UV monotherapy in the treatment of vitiligo.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects with focal or generalized vitiligo were enrolled in this study. Two similar lesions were treated with either targeted narrowband UVB plus topical tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream or targeted UVB alone. The UV treatments were carried out twice a week for 12 weeks. The degree of repigmentation, documented by monthly digital photography, was assessed by a blinded dermatologist.\n\nRESULTS: On completion of the study, statistically significant repigmentation, compared with baseline, occurred in both treatment groups. The overall degree of repigmentation was slightly better in the combination group at 8 and 12 weeks (p\u2009=\u20090.078 and 0.158 respectively). Adverse effects were minor and well tolerated.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeted narrowband UVB phototherapy plus topical tetrahydrocurcuminoid cream was slightly more effective than targeted narrowband UVB monotherapy for vitiligo located in UV-sensitive areas. However, the differences in degrees of repigmentation did not reach statistically significant levels.'"

ADSL,20884265,"'Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL, E. C. 4.3.2.2) carries out two non-sequential steps in de novo AMP synthesis, the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and the conversion of succinyl AMP (AMPS) to AMP. In humans, mutations in ADSL lead to an inborn error of metabolism originally characterized by developmental delay, often with autistic features. There is no effective treatment for ADSL deficiency. Hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis include toxicity of high levels of SAICAR, AMPS, or their metabolites, deficiency of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, or lack of a completely functional purine cycle in muscle and brain. One important approach to understand ADSL deficiency is to develop cell culture models that allow investigation of the properties of ADSL mutants and the consequences of ADSL deficiency at the cellular level. We previously reported the isolation and initial characterization of mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells (AdeI) that lack detectable ADSL activity, accumulate SAICAR and AMPS, and require adenine for growth. Here we report the cDNA sequences of ADSL from CHO-K1 and AdeI cells and describe a mutation resulting in an alanine to valine amino acid substitution at position 291 (A291V) in AdeI ADSL.

The phenotypic severity differs considerably among patients: neonatal fatal, severe childhood, and moderate phenotypic forms correlating with different values for the ratio between S-Ado and SAICAr concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid have been distinguished. To reveal the biochemical and structural basis for this phenotypic heterogeneity, we expressed and characterized 19 ADSL mutant proteins identified in 16 patients representing clinically distinct subgroups. Respecting compound heterozygosity and considering the homotetrameric structure of ADSL, we used intersubunit complementation and prepared and characterized genotype-specific heteromeric mutant ADSL complexes. We correlated clinical phenotypes with biochemical properties of the mutant proteins and predicted structural impacts of the mutations. We found that phenotypic severity in ADSL deficiency is correlated with residual enzymatic activity and structural stability of the corresponding mutant ADSL complexes and does not seem to result from genotype-specific disproportional catalytic activities toward one of the enzyme substrates. This suggests that the S-Ado/SAICAr ratio is probably not predictive of phenotype severity; rather, it may be secondary to the degree of the patient's development (i.e., to the age of the patient at the time of sample collection)."""

LAD, Cx and RCA were each divided into proximal, middle and distal segments. If any part of the individual segment of a coronary artery with antegrade blood flow was not visualised, the segment was labeled as not satisfactorily seen.\n\nRESULTS: Complete imaging of the LM was achieved in 98% of the patients. With antegrade directed coronary artery flow, the proximal, middle and distal segments of LAD were completely seen in 96%, 95% and 91% of patients, respectively. Adding the completely seen segments with antegrade coronary flow and segments with retrograde coronary flow, the proximal, middle and distal segments of LAD were adequately visualised in 96%, 96% and 93% of patients, respectively. With antegrade directed coronary artery flow, the proximal, middle and distal segments of Cx were completely seen in 88%, 61% and 3% and in RCA in 40%, 28% and 54% of patients. Retrograde coronary artery flow was correctly identified as verified by coronary angiography in seven coronary segments, mainly in the posterior descending artery (labeled as the distal segment of RCA) and distal LAD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TTE is a feasible method for complete demonstration of coronary flow in the LM, the proximal Cx and the different segments of LAD, but less suitable for the RCA and mid and distal segments of the Cx.

Empirical evidence shows a relationship between brain and moral development: changes in cerebral architecture are related to changes in moral decision complexity.

Here, we report on two sisters aged 11 and 12 years presented with global developmental delay, motor apraxia, severe speech deficits, seizures and behavioural features, which combined excessive laughter, a very happy disposition, hyperactivity, a short attention span, the mouthing of objects, tantrums and stereotyped movements that gave a behavioural profile mimicking Angelman syndrome. Both patients had an increased succinyladenosine/SAICAr ratio of 1.6, and exhibited a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.674T>C; p.Met225Thr) in the exon 6 of the ADSL gene. We suggest that these clinical features might be a new presentation of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. On the basis of this observation, although adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare disorder, this diagnosis should be considered in patients with mental retardation and a behavioural profile suggestive of Angelman syndrome.'"
ADSL,18709309,"'UNLABELLED: Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy, with a 308-nm xenon chloride excimer laser, and targeted UVB phototherapy have produced encouraging therapeutic results for vitiligo. However, very few studies employing broadband UVB exist. Moreover, there has been no direct comparison study between broadband UVB and NB-UVB for the treatment of vitiligo. The aims of this study were to compare the repigmenting efficacy of targeted broadband UVB phototherapy with that of NB-UVB in an equi-erythemogenic manner. Twenty identical vitiliginous lesions from 10 patients were randomly allocated to receive either targeted broadband UVB or targeted NB-UVB phototherapy. UV fluences were started at 50% of the minimal erythema dose detected within the vitiliginous patches, then increased gradually, in the same manner, to ensure equi-erythemogenic comparison. Treatments were carried out twice weekly for 12 weeks. The results show that grade 1, i.e. 1-25% repigmentation, to grade 2, 26-50% repigmentation, occurred in 6 of 10 subjects. Responses in terms of repigmentation, de-pigmentation, or lack thereof, were similar between lesions receiving broadband and NB-UVB phototherapy. Onset of repigmentation occurred as early as 4 weeks of treatment in most subjects. Treatments were well tolerated, with only minimal erythema and hyperpigmentation.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The study was carried out in a small number of patients with skin types III, IV and V. The irradiation device was a targeted UVB device and thus the results may not be applicable to other light sources, such as the excimer laser or total-body irradiation cabinets. In conclusion, targeted broadband UVB produces similar clinical responses to targeted NB-UVB in the treatment of the non-segmental type of vitiligo.'"

The clinical presentation is characterized by severe neurological involvement including hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay and autistic features. Epilepsy in ADSL deficiency is frequent and occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients, beginning either early in the neonatal period or after the first year of life. At present there is no treatment of proven clinical efficacy. Despite of the increasing number of ADSL-deficient patients reported, there are only a few communications of therapeutic considerations or efforts. Among them only two showed some beneficial effects in ADSL-deficient patients. D-ribose, a simple and relatively cheap therapy, has been associated with improvement of behaviour and progressive reduction of the seizure frequency in one 13-year-old patient with ADSL deficiency. In this study we have re-examined D-ribose treatment in four ADSL-deficient patients. Assessments consisted of biochemical markers and neurological outcome. The 12-month trial of D-ribose failed to show any clinical benefit in ADSL patients with both milder and severe phenotype. D-ribose administration was accompanied by neither reduction in seizure frequency nor growth enhancement. Additionally, patients with milder type II presented the first seizure after 4 and 8 months of the D-ribose treatment. Therefore, we could not confirm a positive effect of D-ribose as previously reported.'"

ADSL,18181973,"'Targeted broadband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy as well as 308-nm excimer laser have been reported to significantly improve or clear localized psoriatic plaques within 5 to 10 treatments when medium fluences [i.e. 4-6 multiples of minimal erythema doses (MED)] were used. Our study was conducted to determine the effects of different concentrations of topical 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) cream when used in combination with targeted UV phototherapy with regard to number of treatments and cumulative UV doses to clear localized psoriasis. Ten evaluable patients with stable plaque-type psoriasis completed the study. Three different concentrations of 8-MOP creams (0.001%, 0.01% and 0.1%) were applied prior to irradiation with 4 MEDs of targeted narrowband UVB (NB-UVB), whereas 0.001% 8-MOP cream was used in conjunction with 5 J/cm(2) UVA. All irradiations took place once weekly for 12 weeks. Psoriasis severity index (PSI) score was used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. With area-under-the-curve analysis, 0.1% 8-MOP/NB-UVB was superior to other modalities in reducing the PSI scores. The number of treatments and cumulative NB-UVB doses necessary to achieve PSI-95, a 95% reduction in the scores, was also lower in the 0.1% 8-MOP/NB-UVB group, although the differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that topical 8-MOP cream enhances the therapeutic effects of targeted NB-UVB phototherapy without significantly increasing the short-term adverse effects.'"

ADSL,17541860,"""Besides the overall budget for building the infrastructure of a healthcare-service-based virtual private network (VPN) in Taiwan, two issues were considered critical for its acceptance by the country's 17,000 plus medical institutions. One was who was to pay for the network (ADSL or modem) connection fee; the other was who was to pay for the firewall/anti-virus software. This paper addresses the second issue by proposing an efficient freeware firewall, named card-assisted firewall (CAF), for NHI VPN edge-hosts, which is also an add-on-value application of the National Healthcare IC card that every insurant and medical professional has. The innovative concept is that any NHI VPN site (edge-host) can establish diversified secure-authenticated connections with other sites only by an authentication mechanism, which requires a NHI Java card state machine and the Access Control List of the host. It is different from two-factor authentication cards in four ways: (1) a PIN code is not a must; (2) it requires authentication with the remote IC card Data Centre; (3) the NHI cards are already available, no modification is needed, and there is no further cost for the deployment of the cards; (4) although the cards are in the reader, the communication cannot start unless the cards are in the corresponding states; i.e. the states allow communication. An implementation, on a Microsoft Windows XP platform, demonstrated the system's feasibility over an emulation of the NHI VPN framework. It maintained a high line speed, the driver took up 39 KB of disk space, installation was simple, not requiring any extra hardware or software, and the average packet processing time of the CAF driver measured was 0.3084 ms. The average overhead in comparing the Access Control List predefined routing in card, in an FTP testing experiment, was 5.7 micros (receiving) and 8 micros (sending)."""

Estimates from 2003 suggested that CT contributed 17% of a radiology department's workload, yet was responsible for up to 75% of the collective population dose from medical radiation. The effective doses for some CT examinations today overlap with those argued to have an increased risk of cancer. This is especially pertinent for paediatric CT, as children are more radiosensitive than adults (and girls more radiosensitive than boys).

Three genotypes within all breeds were found and least square analysis showed that TT genotype birds had a significant higher inosine monophosphate acid (IMP) content than TC (P < 0.01) and CC (P < 0.05) genotype birds, TC genotype birds had a little higher IMP content than CC genotype birds, but the difference was not significant. We proposed this SNP site correlated with IMP content in chickens. A neighbour-joining dendrogram was constructed based on the Nei's genentic distance. The genetic relationship between Chinese red jungle fowl and Tibetan chickens was the nearest, whereas Baier chickens were more closer to Silkies chickens. The Chinese red jungle fowls were relatively closer to the domestic fowls, whereas Thailand red jungle fowls were relatively diverging to the Chinese native breeds.

The only adverse events observed were erythema, which was asymptomatic in most subjects, and hyperpigmentation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Incoherent, targeted UV-B phototherapy is a safe and efficacious treatment modality for localized psoriasis. Its value in other UV-B responsive conditions should be further investigated.'"

On the user side, the system is composed of a graphical interface that interacts in a complex and fluid manner with the registration software running on a remote cluster.\n\nCONCLUSION: Although the transmission of images back and forth between the computer running the user interface and the cluster running the registration service adds to the total registration time, it provides a user-friendly way of using the registration software without heavy infrastructure investments in hospitals. The system exhibits good performances even if the user is connected to the grid service through a low throughput network such as a wireless network interface or ADSL.'"
ADSL,15902552,"""The enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) intervenes twice in the biosynthesis of adenine nucleotides. ADSL deficiency is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by various degrees of psychomotor retardation and accumulation of dephosphorylated enzyme substrates 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (SAdo) in body fluids. Severity of symptoms seems to correlate with residual activity of mutant enzyme and with SAdo/SAICAr concentration ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. To better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease symptoms, studies of catalytic properties of mutant enzymes together with in vitro and in vivo experiments utilizing SAICAr and SAdo must be performed. Such studies require availability of both ADSL substrates, 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) and succinyladenosine 5'-monophosphate (SAMP) and their dephosphorylated products in sufficient amounts and purity. Except for SAMP, none of these compounds is commercially available and they must therefore be synthesized. SAICAR was prepared by recombinant human ADSL-catalysed reaction of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide) with fumarate and isolated by thin-layer chromatography. SAICAr and SAdo were prepared by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation of SAICAR and SAMP and isolated on cation- and anion-exchange resin columns. The procedures described are easily scalable and provide high yields of sufficiently pure products for use in experiments related to studies of pathogenetic mechanisms in ADSL deficiency."""

Despite their essential function, little is known about the regulation and in vivo expression pattern of the genes involved in the de novo purine synthesis pathway. The complete coding region of the bovine phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase gene (PAICS), which catalyses steps 6 and 7 of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, as well as bovine genomic sequences of the six other genes in the pathway producing inosine monophosphate (IMP) and AMP [phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART), phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS), adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) and adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS)], were identified. The genes were mapped to segments of six different bovine chromosomes using a radiation hybrid (RH) cell panel. The gene PPAT, coding for the presumed rate-limiting enzyme of the purine de novo pathway was closely linked to PAICS on BTA6. These, and the other bovine locations i.e. GART at BTA1, PFAS at BTA19, ADSL at BTA5, ATIC at BTA2 and ADSS at BTA16, are in agreement with published comparative maps of cattle and man. PAICS and PPAT genes are known to be closely linked in human, rat and chicken. Previously, an expressed sequence fragment of PAICS (Bos taurus corpus luteum, BTCL9) was mapped to BTA13. By isolation and characterization of a BAC clone, we have now identified a PAICS processed pseudogene sequence (psiPAICS) on BTA13. Processed pseudogene sequences of PAICS and other genes of the purine biosynthesis pathway were identified in several mammalian species, indicating that the genes of this pathway have been susceptible to retrotransposition.

ADSL,15455929,"'Advanced training using Human Patient Simulators (HPS) is, for the large part, unavailable for the majority of healthcare providers in rural, remote, and less developed regions of the world--either due to their separation from the major medical education centers or significant fiscal austerity. Remote access to HPS based on the Applications Software Provider principles may provide the solution to this problem. The medical ASP (MED-ASP) concept proposed and developed by MedSMART has been subjected to an extensive qualitative and quantitative international test conducted among France, Italy, and USA. Two SimMan HPSs (Laerdal, Norway) were used, with one unit based in Ann Arbor, MI, USA, and one in Laval, France. While the French site had both remote and hands-on access to the simulator, the Italian site could access the HPS only remotely. Simulator visualization was provided by 4 remotely operated cameras (Sony, zoom, pan, tilt) at each HPS site. HPS-generated vital signs were transmitted to each site together with the interactive simulator control panel using a communications hub at the MedSMART facility in Ann Arbor. All remote interactions were performed via the Internet (TCP/IP) using ISDN and/or ADSL connections at minimum 128 Kbps. During the course of training, the trainees were exposed to 3 emergency scenarios with the remote expert providing instruction. Interventions were performed either remotely (Italy) or remotely and hands-on (France). Quantitative measurement of the efficiency of training was performed at the Italian site based on the evaluation of video recordings of each session and the assessment of several performance measures. At the end of the training program, a Likert scale-based assessment test was also given. The trainees showed statistically significant (p<0.03 - 0.05) improvement in all testing measures. The Likert scale questionnaire revealed overwhelming satisfaction with the simulation-based distance training even when the access to the simulator was only remote (Italy). Confidence was also significantly improved. The trainees indicated the optimal frequency of distance training as one 2 hour-long session twice a month. In conclusion, simulation-based distance medical training proved to be a highly effective tool in improving emergency medical skills of junior physician trainees and, despite initial reservations, neither distance nor language and cultural differences posed significant obstacles. The present and historical data from our previous work confirm the concept of MED-ASP as a highly efficient tool in both national and international medical education and training. Moreover, we now validate for the first time the concept of simulation-based, fully interactive transatlantic medical ADL that we have proposed in our previous theoretical papers. The present experiments prove that training based on advanced technologies transcends barriers of distance, time, and national medical guidelines. Hence, international simulation-based distance training may ultimately provide the most realistic platform for a large-scale training of emergency medical personnel in less developed countries and in rural/remote regions of the globe.'"

ADSL,15346293,"'PURPOSE: To build an infrastructure that enables radiologists on-call and external users a teleradiological access to the HTML-based image distribution system inside the hospital via internet. In addition, no investment costs should arise on the user side and the image data should be sent renamed using cryptographic techniques.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A pure HTML-based system manages the image distribution inside the hospital, with an open source project extending this system through a secure gateway outside the firewall of the hospital. The gateway handles the communication between the external users and the HTML server within the network of the hospital. A second firewall is installed between the gateway and the external users and builds up a virtual private network (VPN). A connection between the gateway and the external user is only acknowledged if the computers involved authenticate each other via certificates and the external users authenticate via a multi-stage password system. All data are transferred encrypted. External users get only access to images that have been renamed to a pseudonym by means of automated processing before.\n\nRESULTS: With an ADSL internet access, external users achieve an image load frequency of 0.4 CT images per second. More than 90 % of the delay during image transfer results from security checks within the firewalls. Data passing the gateway induce no measurable delay.\n\nCONCLUSION: Project goals were realized by means of an infrastructure that works vendor independently with any HTML-based image distribution systems. The requirements of data security were realized using state-of-the-art web techniques. Adequate access and transfer speed lead to a widespread acceptance of the system on the part of external users.'"

The FAB correctly identified 78.9% of the patients. These results were maintained in a subgroup of mildly demented patients (MMSE score, > or =24). In these patients, a cutoff score of 12 on the FAB was optimal to differentiate both disorders (sensitivity, 77%; specificity, 87%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The FAB takes less than 10 minutes to administer and provides an objective measure to distinguish FTD from AD in mildly demented patients.'"

The evaluation included two remote access technologies consisting of direct ISDN-Dial-Up or VPN connection (Virtual Private Network), with three different connection speeds of 64, 128 (ISDN) and 768 Kbit/s (ADSL-Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), as well as with lossless and lossy compression.\n\nRESULTS: Depending on the image type, the TTD with lossless compression for 64 Kbit/s varied from 1 : 00 to 2 : 40 minutes, for 128 Kbit/s from 0 : 35 to 1 : 15 minutes and for ADSL from 0 : 15 to 0 : 45 minutes. The ISDN-Dial-Up connection was superior to VPN technology at 64 Kbit/s but did not allow higher connection speeds. Lossy compression reduced the TTD by half for all measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: VPN technology is preferable to direct Dial-Up connections since it offers higher connection speeds and advantages in usage and security. For occasional usage, 128 Kbit/s (ISDN) can be considered sufficient, especially in conjunction with lossy compression. ADSL should be chosen when a more frequent usage is anticipated, whereby lossy compression may be omitted. Due to higher bandwidths and improved usability, the web-based approach appears superior to conventional teleradiology systems.'"

The system employed ActiveX control, MPEG-4 coding of full-resolution ultrasound video (640 x 480 pixels at 30 frames/s) and H.320 videoconferencing. It could be used via a Web browser. The system was evaluated over three types of commercial line: a cable connection, ADSL and VDSL. Three radiologists assessed the quality of compressed and uncompressed ultrasound video-sequences from 16 cases (10 abnormal livers, four abnormal kidneys and two abnormal gallbladders). The radiologists' scores showed that, at a given frame rate, increasing the bit rate was associated with increasing quality; however, at a certain threshold bit rate the quality did not increase significantly. The peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) was also measured between the compressed and uncompressed images. In most cases, the PSNR increased as the bit rate increased, and increased as the number of dropped frames increased. There was a threshold bit rate, at a given frame rate, at which the PSNR did not improve significantly. Taking into account both sets of threshold values, a bit rate of more than 0.6 Mbit/s, at 30 frames/s, is suggested as the threshold for the maintenance of diagnostic image quality."""

So what if I can actually get the whole 30 Mbps with a cable network when the website I'm connecting to is running on an ISDN line at 128 Kbps? Broadband offers a lot more bandwidth than the connections many Internet servers have today. Except for the biggest websites, many servers connect to the Internet with a switched 56-Kbps, ISDN, or fractional T1 line. Even with the big websites, my home network only runs a 10 Mbps Ethernet connection to my cable modem. Maybe it doesn't matter that the cable lines are shared or that I can only get 8 Mbps from an ADSL line. Maybe the ISP that I use has a T1 line connection to the Internet so my new ADSL modem has a fatter pipe than my provider! (See table 1). It all makes me wonder what's in store for us in the future. PC technology has increased exponentially in the last 10 years with super fast processor speeds, hard disks of hundreds of gigabytes, and amazing video and audio. Internet connection speeds have failed to keep the same pace. Instead of hundreds of times better or faster--modem speeds are barely 10 times faster. Broadband connections offer some additional speed but still not comparable growth as broadband connections are still in their infancy. Rather than trying to make use of existing communication paths, maybe we need a massive infrastructure makeover of something new. How about national wireless access points so we can connect anywhere, anytime? To use the latest and fastest wireless technology you will simply need to buy another $9.95 WLAN card or download the latest super slick WLAN compression/encryption software. Perhaps it is time for a massive infra-restructuring. Consider the past massive infrastructure efforts. The telcos needed to put in their wiring infrastructure starting in the 1870s before telephones were useful to the masses. CATV was a minor player in the TV broadcast business before they installed their cabling infrastructure and went national. Even automobiles were fairly useless until roads were paved and the highway infrastructure was built!"""

ADSL deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the de novo purine synthesis which results in accumulation of succinylpurines in body fluids. As a result, patients may have variable combinations of psychomotor retardation and/or regression, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. However, intrafamilial variable expression of the phenotype has not been documented to date in this disease and is not commonly observed in metabolic disorders.

Because these vaccines are expensive, population-based surveillance of pneumococcal disease in children <36 months of age was undertaken in Santiago, Chile to provide health authorities with reliable data on the burden of invasive pneumococcal disease and causative serotypes, including those in outpatients with high fever.\n\nMETHODS: Automated blood culture machines were introduced into 9 hospitals that admit 85% of all hospitalized children in Santiago. Acutely ill pediatric febrile ambulatory patients are attended at 8 emergency rooms (ERs) and 36 urgent primary care services. After a 12-month pilot study in 3 ERs, health authorities collected blood cultures from children <36 months of age with high fever seen in the ER as standard practice. isolates were serotyped.\n\nRESULTS: Blood cultures of 18 (1.2%) of 1,503 outpatients 6 to 35 months of age with high fever in the pilot study yielded S. In the ensuing 24 months 236 children <36 months old were hospitalized with invasive pneumococcal disease (incidence, 33.9 cases/10(5) children), and 188 bacteremias were detected among ambulatory ER patients with high fever (incidence, 27.0 cases/10(5) children). Although serotypes were similar among hospitalized and ambulatory cases (except 18C, which was more common in the latter), case fatality was 9.5% in hospitalized (21 of 236) 0% in ambulatory cases (0 of 188) (P = <0.0001). High level resistance to penicillin (25.8% vs 10.1%) and cefotaxime (19.5% vs 6.2%) was observed more often among pneumococcal isolates from hospitalized than among ambulatory cases (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: ER surveillance detected approximately one case of pneumococcal bacteremia among febrile ambulatory patients for each hospitalized invasive case. Because 71% of cases were caused by vaccine serotypes (and 87% by vaccine serogroups), 9- and 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines could prevent most invasive pediatric pneumococcal disease in Chile.'"
ADSL,12016589,"'Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL; also called ""adenylosuccinase"") catalyzes two steps in the synthesis of purine nucleotides: (1) the conversion of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide into aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide and (2) the conversion of adenylosuccinate into adenosine monophosphate. ADSL deficiency, a recessively inherited disorder, causes variable-but most often severe-mental retardation, frequently accompanied by epilepsy and/or autism. It is characterized by the accumulation, in body fluids, of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside and succinyladenosine, the dephosphorylated derivatives of the two substrates of the enzyme. Analysis of the ADSL gene of three unrelated patients with ADSL deficiency, in whom one of the ADSL alleles displayed a normal coding sequence, revealed a -49T-->C mutation in the 5\' untranslated region of this allele. Measurements of the amount of mRNA transcribed from the latter allele showed that it was reduced to approximately 33% of that transcribed from the alleles mutated in their coding sequence. Further investigations showed that the -49T-->C mutation provokes a reduction to 25% of wild-type control of promoter function, as evaluated by luciferase activity and mRNA level in transfection experiments. The mutation also affects the binding of nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2), a known activator of transcription, as assessed by gel-shift studies. Our findings indicate that a mutation of a regulatory region of the ADSL gene might be an unusually frequent cause of ADSL deficiency, and they suggest a role for NRF-2 in the gene regulation of the purine biosynthetic pathway.'"

ADSL,11311666,"'Taiwan is a heavily populated country, with a small land area and many mountains and isolated islands. Because medical resources are unequally distributed, high quality accessible medical care is a major problem in rural areas. Medical personnel are unwilling to practice in rural areas because of fear of isolation from peers and lack of continuing medical education (CME) in those areas. Telemedicine provides a timeless and spaceless measure for teleconsultation and education. The development of telemedicine in Taiwan began under the National Information Infrastructure (NII) Project. Distance education and teleconsultation were the first experimental projects during the initiation research stage. The cost and effectiveness of the hardware and network bandwidth were evaluated. In the promotion research stage, applications in different medical disciplines were tested to promote multipoint videoconference, electronic journals and VOD.

ADSL,10958654,"""Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency (MIM 103050) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of purine synthesis characterized by the accumulation in body fluids of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide (SAICA) riboside and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), the dephosphorylated derivatives of the two substrates of the enzyme. Because ADSL-deficient patients display widely variable degrees of psychomotor retardation, we have expressed eight mutated ADSL enzymes as thioredoxin fusions and compared their properties with the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 10 patients. Three expressed mutated ADSL enzymes (M26L, R426H and T450S) were thermolabile, four (A2V, R141W, R303C and S395R) were thermostable and one (del206-218), was inactive. Thermolabile mutations decreased activities with SAICA ribotide (SAICAR) and adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) in parallel, or more with SAICAR than with S-AMP. Patients homozygous for one of these mutations, R426H, displayed similarly decreased ADSL activities in their fibroblasts, S-Ado:SAICA riboside ratios of approximately 1 in their cerebrospinal fluid and were profoundly retarded. With the exception of A2V, thermostable mutations decreased activity with S-AMP to a much more marked extent than with SAICAR. Two unrelated patients homozygous for one of the thermostable mutations, R303C, also displayed a much more marked decrease in the activity of fibroblast ADSL with S-AMP than with SAICAR, had S-Ado:SAICA riboside ratios between 3 and 4 in their cerebrospinal fluid and were mildly retarded. These results suggest that, in some cases, the genetic lesion of ADSL determines the ratio of its activities with S-AMP versus SAICAR, which in turn defines the S-Ado:SAICA riboside ratio and the patients' mental status."""
ADSL,10888601,"'Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is a bifunctional enzyme acting in de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide recycling. ADSL deficiency is a selectively neuronopathic disorder with psychomotor retardation and epilepsy as leading traits. Both dephosphorylated enzyme substrates, succinylaminoimidazole-carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected individuals with S-Ado/SAICAr concentration ratios proportional to the phenotype severity. We studied the disorder at various levels in a group of six patients with ADSL deficiency. We identified the complete ADSL cDNA and its alternatively spliced isoform resulting from exon 12 skipping. Both mRNA isoforms were expressed in all the tissues studied with the non-spliced form 10-fold more abundant. Both cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized at the protein level. The results showed only the unspliced ADSL to be active. The gene consists of 13 exons spanning 23 kb. The promotor region shows typical features of the housekeeping gene. Eight mutations were identified in a group of six patients. The expression studies of the mutant proteins carried out in an attempt to study genotype-phenotype correlation showed that the level of residual enzyme activity correlates with the severity of the clinical phenotype. All the mutant enzymes studied in vitro displayed a proportional decrease in activity against both of their substrates. However, this was not concordant with strikingly different concentration ratios in the CSF of individual patients. This suggests either different in vivo enzyme activities against each of the substrates and/or their different turnover across the CSF-blood barrier, which may be decisive in determining disease severity.'"

Although multimedia based courses and tutorials via the Internet seem to serve best for a more effective teaching and new didactics, respective anatomical offers in Germany are scarce and thus practice and experience are limited. Only simple digital equivalents of conventional contents and methods can be found, whereas the potencies of the new media are not realized in didactic concepts. Substantial advantages of web based tutorial systems are an intensive use of the feedback possibilities, the opportunity for continuous updating of the contents, the favourable distribution, and faster utilization of improved techniques. This paper introduces the adaptation of different techniques and the development of concepts and notions of modern Internet based teaching by the way of three different events in anatomical education for medical students and doctors. HistoNet 2000 was developed as an interface of lectures, seminars and practical courses in microscopy. The online transmission of a microscopical course as an interactive practical teleteaching was performed by the way of asymmetric data transfer via the ADSL-technology. Multicasting was used as well and has also been applied for the third project. In this multimedial online teaching different specialties were joined together for interdisciplinary courses via the Internet. These new technologies lead to enhanced efficiency in teaching and enlarge the educational offer. Specific Internet adapted teaching and learning projects have to be developed.'"

Most ADSL-deficient children display marked psychomotor delay, often accompanied by epilepsy or autistic features, or both, although some patients may be less profoundly retarded. Occasionally, growth retardation and muscular wasting are also present. Up to now, nine missense mutations of the ADSL gene had been reported in six apparently unrelated sibships. In the present study of 10 additional patients with ADSL deficiency, nine point mutations, among which seven unreported missense mutations, and the first splicing error reported in this disorder, have been identified. These mutations have been characterized, taking into account the finding that the cDNA of human ADSL is 75 nucleotides longer at its 5'-end, and encodes a protein of 484 rather than 459 amino acids as previously reported. Five apparently unrelated patients were found to carry a R426H mutation.

Here, we explored the function and molecular mechanisms of CHK2 in the progression of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).\n\nMETHODS: The expression levels of both total CHK2 and activated CHK2 (p-CHK2) in tissues from 100 PTC patients were detected and evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The roles of CHK2 on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers were investigated by CCK-8, Transwell, flow cytometry, western blot and ALDEFLOUR assay. PTC cells cultured in suspension conditions were assayed for anoikis. The anchorage-independent condition was further detected by soft agar colony formation assay. Furthermore, anoikis associated regulatory proteins were explored by western blot and verified by forced downregulation experiment, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: We found that the levels of both CHK2 and p-CHK2 were significantly upregulated in PTC cancer tissues compared with those in tumor-adjacent tissues. The overexpression of p-CHK2 in primary tumor tissues was associated with tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. However, the levels of both CHK2 and p-CHK2 were decreased in metastatic lymph nodes. Our results showed that CHK2 upregulated the levels of CSC markers with no effect on cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Interestingly, we revealed a previously undescribed anoikis-promoting role for CHK2 in PTC. Specifically, the detachment of PTC cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers CHK2 degradation. Then, the forced downregulation of CHK2 rescued PTC cells from anoikis, but no effect was observed on the apoptosis of adherent PTC cells. Additionally, as a novel regulator of anoikis, CHK2 can induce cell death in a p53-independent manner via the regulation of PRAS40 activation.\n\nCONCLUSION: High expression levels of CHK2 and p-CHK2 were associated with the progression of PTC. Our results defined an unexpected role for CHK2 as a mediator of anoikis that functions through the regulation of PRAS40 activation, which may be associated with the survival of circulating tumor cells and metastatic behavior.'"

It contains the atypical kinase mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit that binds to the Tor signalling sequence (TOS) motif of substrates and regulators. mTORC1 is activated by the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain) and inhibited by PRAS40. Here we present the 3.0 ångström cryo-electron microscopy structure of mTORC1 and the 3.4 ångström structure of activated RHEB-mTORC1. RHEB binds to mTOR distally from the kinase active site, yet causes a global conformational change that allosterically realigns active-site residues, accelerating catalysis. Cancer-associated hyperactivating mutations map to structural elements that maintain the inactive state, and we provide biochemical evidence that they mimic RHEB relieving auto-inhibition. We also present crystal structures of RAPTOR-TOS motif complexes that define the determinants of TOS recognition, of an mTOR FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain-substrate complex that establishes a second substrate-recruitment mechanism, and of a truncated mTOR-PRAS40 complex that reveals PRAS40 inhibits both substrate-recruitment sites. These findings help explain how mTORC1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled, and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations.'"

Exosome secretion is triggered by extracellular or intracellular stress signals. Little is known, however, about the signal transduction between stress cues and exosome secretion. To identify the linker protein, we took advantage of a unique finding in human keratinocytes. In these cells, although transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) share the same EGF receptor and previously indistinguishable intracellular signaling networks, only TGF-α stimulation causes exosome-mediated secretion. However, deduction of EGF-activated pathways from TGFα-activated pathways in the same cells allowed us to identify the proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) as the unique downstream effector of TGF-α but not EGF signaling via threonine 308-phosphorylated Akt. PRAS40 knockdown (KD) or PRAS40 dominant-negative (DN) mutant overexpression blocks not only TGF-α- but also hypoxia- and HO-induced exosome secretion in a variety of normal and tumor cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and gene rescue studies show that Akt-mediated activation of PRAS40 via threonine 246 phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient to cause exosome secretion without affecting the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway.

While it has been proven to be very successful initially, most patients eventually develop resistance to trastuzumab. The mechanism of drug resistance is not well understood. Identifying pathways that mediate trastuzumab resistance will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism and is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.Here we report a quantitative proteomics profiling of a trastuzumab-sensitive (T-S) gastric cancer cell line NCI N87 and a trastuzumab-resistant NCI N87 (T-R) subline generated by low-dose, continuous trastuzumab treatment. By identifying proteins differentially expressed in these two cell lines, we show that multiple pathways including mTOR, Wnt, DNA damage response and metabolic pathways are significantly altered. We further confirm by western blotting that protein levels of multiple components of the mTOR pathway, including mTOR, AKT and RPS6KB1, are increased, whereas AKT1S1 is decreased, suggesting the activation of mTOR pathway. Importantly, treatment of AZD8055, an mTOR inhibitor, leads to the decreased phosphorylation levels of mTOR downstream molecules RPS6KB1 at Thr421/Ser424 and AKT at Ser473. Furthermore, AZD8055 also preferentially reduces viability, and inhibits migration and invasion abilities of the T-R cells. Together, our findings indicate that mTOR pathway is among multiple signaling pathways that mediate trastuzumab resistance in NCI N87 T-R cells, and that mTOR inhibitors may be used to treat trastuzumab resistant, HER2-positive gastric cancer tumors.'"

Additionally, growing evidence suggests that breast cancer cells that do successfully metastasize have a stem-like phenotype including high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and/or a CD44+CD24- phenotype. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that these ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells interact with factors in the bone secondary organ microenvironment to facilitate metastasis. Specifically, we focused on bone-derived osteopontin and its ability to promote the migration and stem-like phenotype of breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that bone-derived osteopontin promotes the migration, tumorsphere-forming ability and colony-forming ability of whole population and ALDHhiCD44+CD24- breast cancer cells in bone marrow-conditioned media (an ex vivo representation of the bone microenvironment) (p≤0.05). We also demonstrate that CD44 and RGD-dependent cell surface integrins facilitate this functional response to bone-derived osteopontin (p≤0.05), potentially through activation of WNK-1 and PRAS40-related pathways. Our findings suggest that soluble bone-derived osteopontin enhances the ability of breast cancer cells to migrate to the bone and maintain a stem-like phenotype within the bone microenvironment, and this may contribute to the establishment and growth of bone metastases.'"

Whereas the high serum urate levels observed in patients with gout predispose them to the formation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, soluble urate also primes for inflammatory signals in cells responding to gout-related stimuli, but also in other common metabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which uric acid selectively lowers human blood monocyte production of the natural inhibitor IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and shifts production toward the highly inflammatory IL-1β. Monocytes from healthy volunteers were first primed with uric acid for 24 h and then subjected to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of MSU. Transcriptomic analysis revealed broad inflammatory pathways associated with uric acid priming, with NF-κB and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling strongly increased. Functional validation did not identify NF-κB or AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, but uric acid priming induced phosphorylation of AKT and proline-rich AKT substrate 40 kDa (PRAS 40), which in turn activated mTOR. Subsequently, Western blot for the autophagic structure LC3-I and LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) fractions, as well as fluorescence microscopy of LC3-GFP-overexpressing HeLa cells, revealed lower autophagic activity in cells exposed to uric acid compared with control conditions. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species production was diminished by uric acid priming. Thus, the Akt-PRAS40 pathway is activated by uric acid, which inhibits autophagy and recapitulates the uric acid-induced proinflammatory cytokine phenotype.'"

To investigate mTOR pathway activity in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma AR-DLBCL, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the presence of the phosphorylated 70 ribosomal S6 protein-kinase (p70S6K), an extensively studied effector of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and the phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog (pPTEN), a negative regulator of mTORC1 pathway.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated tissue samples from 126 patients with AR-DLBCL. Among them, 98 samples were from tissue microarrays (TMAs) supplied by the Aids and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR), the remaining 28 samples were from cases diagnosed and treated at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The presence of p70S6K was evaluated with two antibodies directed against the combined epitopes Ser235/236 and Ser240/244, respectively; and additional monoclonal anti-bodies were used to identify pPTEN and phosphorylated proline-rich Akt substrate of 40kDa (pPRAS40). The degree of intensity and percentage of cells positive for p70S6K and pPTEN were assessed in all the samples. In addition, a subgroup of 28 patients from UCSD was studied to assess the presence of pPRAS40, an insulin-regulated activator of the mTORC1. The expression of each of these markers was correlated with clinical and histopathologic features.\n\nRESULTS: The majority of the patients evaluated were males (88%); only two cases (1.6%) were older than 65 years of age. We found high levels of both p70S6K-paired epitopes studied, 48% positivity against Ser235/236 (44% in ACSR and 64% in UCSD group), and 86% positivity against Ser240/244 (82% in ACSR and 100% in UCSD group). We observed more positive cells and stronger intensity with epitope Ser240/244 in comparison to Ser235/236 (p<0.0001). The degree of intensity and percentage of cells positive for pPTEN was positively correlated with p70S6K levels (p = 0.016 for 235/236 and p = 0.007 for 240/244). High levels of pPRAS40 were observed in the majority of the cases evaluated (64.3%), but no correlation was found with either pPTEN (p = 0.9) or p70S6K (p = 0.9) levels.\n\nCONCLUSION: AR-DLBCL frequently contain p70S6K, a main downstream effector of the mTOR pathway. The presence of p70S6K is positively correlated with pPTEN, an inactive form of PTEN, which makes mTORC1 activated. The presence of p70S6K was independent of HIV viral load or CD4 (+) counts. These results suggest that the mTOR pathway is active in the majority of AR-DLBCL, and p70S6K, particularly the Ser240/244 epitope immunohistochemistry is an excellent surrogate biomarker, which could be used to identify cases expected to be responsive to mTOR inhibitors.'"

Although, deregulation of K8 phosphorylation is associated with progression of different carcinomas, its role in skin-SCC and the underlying mechanism is obscure. In this direction, we performed tandem mass tag-based quantitative phosphoproteomics by expressing K8 wild type, phosphodead, and phosphomimetic mutants in K8-deficient A431 cells. Further analysis of our phosphoproteomics data showed a significant proportion of total phosphoproteome associated with migratory, proliferative, and invasive potential of these cells to be differentially phosphorylated.

A longitudinal study for an average of 35\xa0months was performed to assess their cognitive decline over time. By using cognition as the phenotype, we detected genes that modified cognitive impairments, including AKT2, PIK3CB, IGF1R, PIK3CD, MTOR, IDE, AKT1S1 and AKT1. Based on these loci, the mass univariate modeling was utilized to construct the functional network. The MCIs showed disconnections mainly in the cerebellum-frontal-temporal regions, while compensations may occur in frontal-parietal regions to maintain the overall network efficiency.

We detected the MGMT status through pyrosequencing and western blotting, and we also assessed the proliferation, migration, EMT-like changes and possible activated signaling pathways in U87/TR cells. Our results demonstrated that U87/TR was MGMT negative, which indicated that MGMT made no contribution for TMZ-resistance of U87/TR. And U87/TR cells displayed cell cycle arrest, higher capacity for migration and EMT-like changes including both phenotype and characteristic proteins. We also revealed that both β-catenin and the phosphorylation level of Akt and PRAS40 were increased in U87/TR, while we did not observe the phosphorylation of mTOR in U87/TR. It indicated that activation of Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways may be response for the chemo-resistance and increased invasion of U87/TR cells, and the phosphorylation of PRAS40 and inactivated mTOR may be related to cell cycle arrest in U87/TR cells.'"

However, its role and mechanism in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unknown. In this study, we found that expression of miR-1908 was significantly downregulated in human NSCLC cell lines, including SK-MES-1, A549, and NCI-H460. Then the role of miR-1908 in NSCLC cell proliferation was explored. The miR-1908 mimic was transfected into NSCLC cell lines, and their proliferation was detected. MTT and Cell Titer-Blue H analyses showed that the cell proliferation was notably reduced by the miR-1908 mimic transfection. Moreover, we found the RP-p53 pathway was activated by miR-1908 mimic. Moreover, the miR-1908 inhibitor transfection had a completely opposite effect on the NSCLC cell proliferation than that of miR-1908 mimic. To explore the underlying mechanism of that, TargetScan bioinformatics server and 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay were applied to identify the targets of miR-1908. Our results showed that AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1), a newly proven suppressor of the RP-p53 pathway, was a target of miR-1908, suggesting a probable mechanism for miR-191 suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation. Our findings provide a novel molecular target for the regulation of NSCLC cell proliferation."""

Identifying correlates of response and mechanisms of resistance in this population will facilitate clinical management and rational therapeutic development.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine correlates of benefit from CombiDT therapy in patients with BRAFi-refractory metastatic melanoma.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-center, single-arm, open-label phase 2 trial of CombiDT treatment in patients with BRAF V600 metastatic melanoma resistant to BRAFi monotherapy conducted between September 2012 and October 2014 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Key eligibility criteria for participants included BRAF V600 metastatic melanoma, prior BRAFi monotherapy, measurable disease (RECIST 1.1), and tumor accessible for biopsy.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with dabrafenib (150 mg, twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg/d) continuously until disease progression or intolerance. All participants underwent a mandatory baseline biopsy, and optional biopsy specimens were obtained on treatment and at disease progression. Whole-exome sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis for BRAF splicing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis were performed on tumor samples, and blood was analyzed for levels of circulating BRAF V600.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were secondary clinical end points.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 28 patients were screened, and 23 enrolled. Among evaluable patients, the confirmed ORR was 10%; disease control rate (DCR) was 45%, and median PFS was 13 weeks. Clinical benefit was associated with duration of prior BRAFi therapy greater than 6 months (DCR, 73% vs 11% for ≤6 months; P\u2009=\u2009.02) and decrease in circulating BRAF V600 at day 8 of cycle 1 (DCR, 75% vs 18% for no decrease; P\u2009=\u2009.02) but not with pretreatment mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations or activation. Biopsy specimens obtained during treatment demonstrated that CombiDT therapy failed to achieve significant MAPK pathway inhibition or immune infiltration in most patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The baseline presence of MAPK pathway alterations was not associated with benefit from CombiDT in patients with BRAFi-refractory metastatic melanoma. Failure to inhibit the MAPK pathway provides a likely explanation for the limited clinical benefit of CombiDT in this setting. Circulating BRAF V600 is a promising early biomarker of clinical response.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01619774.'"

AKT1S1,26876939,"'Reduction of translational fidelity often occurs in cells with high rates of protein synthesis, generating defective ribosomal products. If not removed, such aberrant proteins can be a major source of cellular stress causing human diseases. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes the formation of immunoproteasomes for efficient turnover of defective proteins and cell survival. mTORC1 sequesters precursors of immunoproteasome β subunits via PRAS40. When activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates PRAS40 to enhance protein synthesis and simultaneously to facilitate the assembly of the β subunits for forming immunoproteasomes. Consequently, the PRAS40 phosphorylations play crucial roles in clearing aberrant proteins that accumulate due to mTORC1 activation. Mutations of RAS, PTEN, and TSC1, which cause mTORC1 hyperactivation, enhance immunoproteasome formation in cells and tissues. Those mutations increase cellular dependence on immunoproteasomes for stress response and survival. These results define a mechanism by which mTORC1 couples elevated protein synthesis with immunoproteasome biogenesis to protect cells against protein stress.'"

An unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic survey identified 974 PKM2 substrates, including serine202 and serine203 (S202/203) of AKT1S1, in the proteome of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Phosphorylation of S202/203 of AKT1S1 by PKM2 released AKT1S1 from raptor and facilitated its binding to 14-3-3, resulted in hormonal- and nutrient-signals independent activation of mTORC1 signaling and led accelerated oncogenic growth and autophagy inhibition in cancer cells. Decreasing S202/203 phosphorylation by TEPP-46 treatment reversed these effects. In RCCs and breast cancers, PKM2 overexpression was correlated with elevated S202/203 phosphorylation, activated mTORC1 and inhibited autophagy. Our results provided the first phosphorylome of PKM2 and revealed a constitutive mTORC1 activating mechanism in cancer cells.'"

Signatures were validated in temporally paired biopsies from patients treated with GSK2141795 in a clinical study. GSK2141795 caused growth-arrest as single agent in vitro, enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and reduced tumour volume in combination with platinum in vivo.

Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we identified several point mutations in MTOR and its upstream regulator RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common histology of kidney cancer. Interestingly, we found a prominent cluster of hyperactivating mutations in the FAT (FRAP-ATM-TTRAP) domain of mTOR in renal cell carcinoma that led to an increase in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities and led to an increased proliferation of cells. Several of the FAT domain mutants demonstrated a decreased binding of DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein), while a subset of these mutations showed altered binding of the negative regulator PRAS40 (proline rich AKT substrate 40). We also identified a recurrent mutation in RHEB in ccRCC patients that leads to an increase in mTORC1 activity. In vitro characterization of this RHEB mutation revealed that this mutant showed considerable resistance to TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2) GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity, though its interaction with TSC2 remained unaltered. Mutations in the FAT domain of MTOR and in RHEB remained sensitive to rapamycin, though several of these mutations demonstrated residual mTOR kinase activity after treatment with rapamycin at clinically relevant doses.

AKT1S1,25961827,"'The mTORC1 inhibitors, rapamycin and its analogs, are known to show only modest antitumor activity in clinic, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we found that activated AKT signaling is associated with rapamycin resistance in breast and colon cancers by sustained phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1. Treatment of tumor cells with rapamycin or the AKT inhibitor MK2206 showed a limited activity in inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cap-dependent translation, cell growth and motility. However, treatment with both drugs resulted in profound effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the combination treatment was required to effectively inhibit PRAS40 phosphorylation on both Ser183 and Thr246 mediated by mTORC1 and AKT respectively, and with the combined treatment, dephosphorylated PRAS40 binding to the raptor/mTOR complex was enhanced, leading to dramatic repression of mTORC1-regulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and translation. Knockdown of PRAS40 or 4E-BP1 expression markedly reduced the dependence of tumor cells on AKT/mTORC1 signaling for translation and survival. Together, these findings reveal a critical role of PRAS40 as an integrator of mTORC1 and AKT signaling for 4E-BP1-mediated translational regulation of tumor cell growth and motility, and highlight PRAS40 phosphorylation as a potential biomarker to evaluate the therapeutic response to mTOR/AKT inhibitors.'"

TGFBI transgenic and gene knockout mice and TGFBI-overexpressing liver cells were used for mechanistic studies.\n\nRESULTS: We demonstrated that patients with cholangiocarcinomas, hepatic carcinomas or gastric carcinomas presented significantly elevated serum TGFBI levels, and the excess TGFBI was derived from the tumor masses. TGFBI overexpression in mice resulted in increased incidence of spontaneous tumors and N,N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumor nodules, compared to that in wild type (WT) mice, while TGFBI knockout mice were comparable to WT controls in these 2 aspects. TGFBI promoted the survival of Aml-12 liver cells with DNA damage after irradiation, and augmented their post-irradiation proliferation. It activated the FAK/AKT/AKT1S1/PRS6/EIF4EBP pathway, which is known to modulate cell survival and proliferation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that TGFBI functions as a promoter of certain gastrointestinal tract cancers.

To ascertain the effect of bariatric surgery on insulin signalling, we examined glucose disposal and Akt activation in morbidly obese volunteers before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), and compared this to lean volunteers.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, at five infusion rates, was used to determine glucose disposal rates (GDR) in eight morbidly obese (body mass index, BMI=47.3 ± 2.2 kg/m(2)) patients, before and after RYGB, and in eight lean volunteers (BMI=20.7 ± 0.7 kg/m2). Biopsies of brachioradialis muscle, taken at fasting and insulin concentrations that induced half-maximal (GDR50) and maximal (GDR100) GDR in each subject, were used to examine the phosphorylation of Akt-Thr308, Akt-473, and pras40, in vivo biomarkers for Akt activity.\n\nRESULTS: Pre-operatively, insulin-stimulated GDR was lower in the obese compared to the lean individuals (P<0.001). Weight-loss of 29.9 ± 4 kg after surgery significantly improved GDR50 (P=0.004) but not GDR100 (P=0.3). These subjects still remained significantly more insulin resistant than the lean individuals (p<0.001). Weight loss increased insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle Akt-Thr308 and Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation, P=0.02 and P=0.03 respectively (MANCOVA), and Akt activity towards the substrate PRAS40 (P=0.003, MANCOVA), and in contrast to GDR, were fully normalised after the surgery (obese vs lean, P=0.6, P=0.35, P=0.46, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show that although Akt activity substantially improved after surgery, it did not lead to a full restoration of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. This suggests that a major defect downstream of, or parallel to, Akt signalling remains after significant weight-loss.'"

Specific mechanism by which high glucose inhibits PTEN expression is not clear. We found that high glucose increased the expression of the microRNA-26a (miR-26a) in mesangial cells. Using a sensor plasmid with 3'UTR-driven luciferase, we showed PTEN as a target of miR-26a in response to high glucose. Overexpression of miR-26a reduced the PTEN protein levels resulting in increased Akt kinase activity similar to high glucose treatment. In contrast, anti-miR-26a reversed high glucose-induced suppression of PTEN with concomitant inhibition of Akt kinase activity. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin and PRAS40 regulates mTORC1, which is necessary for mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein expression. Inhibition of high glucose-induced miR-26a blocked phosphorylation of tuberin and PRAS40, which lead to suppression of phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4EBP-1, two substrates of mTORC1. Furthermore, we show that expression of miR-26a induced mesangial cell hypertrophy and increased fibronectin and collagen I (α2) expression similar to that observed with the cells incubated with high glucose. Anti-miR-26a inhibited these phenomena in response to high glucose. Together our results provide the first evidence for the involvement of miR-26a in high glucose-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein expression.

Firstly, the expression of myosin VI was analyzed in 57 hepatocellular carcinoma samples and 10 non-neoplastic samples by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that myosin VI expression was much stronger in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. Myosin VI short hairpin RNA was then transduced into HepG2 and SMMC-7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, respectively, using a lentivirus delivery system. Knockdown of myosin VI led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and colony-forming capacity, as well as a blockade of cell cycle progression. Moreover, an obvious decrease in PRAS40 phosphorylation and a concomitant increase in p38 phosphorylation were observed in myosin VI knockdown cells, which suggest that myosin VI silencing inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth in\xa0vitro probably via inactivation of PRAS40 and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway.

AKT1S1,25288788,"'High glucose-induced Akt acts as a signaling hub for mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix expansion, which are recognized as cardinal signatures for the development of diabetic nephropathy. How mesangial cells sustain the activated state of Akt is not clearly understood. Here we show Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor FoxO1 by high glucose. Phosphorylation-deficient, constitutively active FoxO1 inhibited the high glucose-induced phosphorylation of Akt to suppress the phosphorylation/inactivation of PRAS40 and mTORC1 activity. In contrast, dominant negative FoxO1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt, resulting in increased mTORC1 activity similar to high glucose treatment. Notably, FoxO1 regulates high glucose-induced protein synthesis, hypertrophy, and expression of fibronectin and PAI-1. High glucose paves the way for complications of diabetic nephropathy through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We considered whether the FoxO1 target antioxidant enzyme catalase contributes to sustained activation of Akt. High glucose-inactivated FoxO1 decreases the expression of catalase to increase the production of ROS. Moreover, we show that catalase blocks high glucose-stimulated Akt phosphorylation to attenuate the inactivation of FoxO1 and PRAS40, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1 and mesangial cell hypertrophy and fibronectin and PAI-1 expression. Finally, using kidney cortices from type 1 diabetic OVE26 mice, we show that increased FoxO1 phosphorylation is associated with decreased catalase expression and increased fibronectin and PAI-1 expression.

Apigenin and luteolin were identified in our U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell screening assay for micronutrients triggering rapid intracellular translocation of the forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FOXO1), an important mediator of insulin signal transduction. Insulin reversed the translocation of FOXO1 as shown by live cell imaging. The impact on the expression of target genes was evaluated in HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells. The mRNA-expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pc), the lipogenic enzymes fatty-acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) were down-regulated by both flavones with smaller effective dosages of apigenin than for luteolin. PKB/AKT-, PRAS40-, p70S6K-, and S6-phosphorylation was reduced by apigenin and luteolin but not that of the insulin-like growth factor receptor IGF-1R by apigenin indicating a direct inhibition of the PKB/AKT-signaling pathway distal to the IGF-1 receptor. N-acetyl-L-cysteine did not prevent FOXO1 nuclear translocation induced by apigenin and luteolin, suggesting that these flavones do not act via oxidative stress. The roles of FOXO1, FOXO3a, AKT, sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived2)-like2 (NRF2), investigated by siRNA knockdown, showed differential patterns of signal pathways involved and a role of NRF2 in the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzyme expression.

AKT1S1,25075204,"'BACKGROUND: We have witnessed significant progress in gene-based approaches to cancer prognostication, promising early intervention for high-risk patients and avoidance of overtreatment for low-risk patients. However, there has been less advancement in protein-based approaches, even though perturbed protein levels and post-translational modifications are more directly linked with phenotype. Most current, gene expression-based platforms require tissue lysis resulting in loss of structural and molecular information, and hence are blind to tumor heterogeneity and morphological features.\n\nRESULTS: Here we report an automated, integrated multiplex immunofluorescence in situ imaging approach that quantitatively measures protein biomarker levels and activity states in defined intact tissue regions where the biomarkers of interest exert their phenotype. Using this approach, we confirm that four previously reported prognostic markers, PTEN, SMAD4, CCND1 and SPP1, can predict lethal outcome of human prostate cancer. Furthermore, we show that two PI3K pathway-regulated protein activities, pS6 (RPS6-phosphoserines 235/236) and pPRAS40 (AKT1S1-phosphothreonine 246), correlate with prostate cancer lethal outcome as well (individual marker hazard ratios of 2.04 and 2.03, respectively). Finally, we incorporate these 2 markers into a novel 5-marker protein signature, SMAD4, CCND1, SPP1, pS6, and pPRAS40, which is highly predictive for prostate cancer-specific death. The ability to substitute PTEN with phospho-markers demonstrates the potential of quantitative protein activity state measurements on intact tissue.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, our approach can reproducibly and simultaneously quantify and assess multiple protein levels and functional activities on intact tissue specimens. We believe it is broadly applicable to not only cancer but other diseases, and propose that it should be well suited for prognostication at early stages of pathogenesis where key signaling protein levels and activities are perturbed.'"

The spatiotemporal expression of growth factors indicates that they play an important role in pregnancy. The goal of this study is to define the role of the ERBB family of growth factor receptors in endometrial function. Using conditional ablation in mice and siRNA in primary human endometrial stromal cells, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) to be critical for endometrial function during early pregnancy. While ablation of Her2 or Erbb3 led to only a modest reduction in litter size, mice lacking Egfr expression are severely subfertile. Pregnancy demise occurred shortly after blastocyst implantation due to defects in decidualization including decreased proliferation, cell survival, differentiation and target gene expression. To place Egfr in a genetic regulatory hierarchy, transcriptome analyses was used to compare the gene signatures from mice with conditional ablation of Egfr, wingless-related MMTV integration site 4 (Wnt4) or boneless morphogenic protein 2 (Bmp2); revealing that not only are Bmp2 and Wnt4 key downstream effectors of Egfr, but they also regulate distinct physiological functions. In primary human endometrial stromal cells, marker gene expression, a novel high content image-based approach and phosphokinase array analysis were used to demonstrate that EGFR is a critical regulator of human decidualization. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR signaling intermediaries WNK1 and AKT1S1, members identified in the kinase array and previously unreported to play a role in the endometrium, also attenuate decidualization.

Recombinant TGFBI and transgenic TGFBI overexpression can promote both islet survival and function. In this study, we generated TGFBI KO mice and further assessed TGFBI function and signaling pathways in islets. Islets from KO mice were of normal size and quantity, and these animals were normoglycemic. However, KO islet survival and function was compromised in vitro. In vivo, KO donor islets became inferior to wild-type donor islets in achieving normoglycemia when transplanted into KO diabetic recipients. TGFBI KO mice were more prone to straptozotocin-induced diabetes than the wild-type counterpart. Phosphoprotein array analysis established that AKT1S1, a molecule linking the AKT and mTORC1 signaling pathways, was modulated by TGFBI in islets. Phosphorylation of four molecules in the AKT and mTORC1 signaling pathway, i.e. AKT, AKT1S1, RPS6 and EIF4EBP1, was upregulated in islets upon TGFBI stimulation. Suppression of AKT activity by a chemical inhibitor, or knockdown of AKT1S1, RPS6 and EIF4EBP1 expression by small interfering RNA, modulated islet survival, proving the relevance of these molecules in TGFBI-triggered signaling. Human genetic studies revealed that in the TGFBI gene and its vicinity, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with type 1 diabetes risks, and one with type 2 diabetes risks. Our study suggests that TGFBI is a potential risk gene for human diabetes.'"
AKT1S1,24704832,"'The ribosomal protein (RP)-HDM2-p53 pathway has been shown to have key roles in oncogene-induced apoptosis and senescence, but the mechanism regulating this pathway remains elusive. The proline-rich Akt substrate of 40\u2009kDa\xa0(PRAS40) has recently been identified as a binding partner and inhibitor of the mechanistic (formerly referred to as mammalian)\xa0target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Although other inhibitors of mTORC1 are known tumor suppressors, PRAS40 promotes cell survival and tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that Akt- and mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 at T246 and S221, respectively, promotes nuclear-specific association of PRAS40 with ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11). Importantly, silencing of PRAS40 induces upregulation of p53 in a manner dependent on RPL11. This effect is rescued by wild-type PRAS40, but not by the RPL11-binding-null PRAS40T246A mutant. We found that PRAS40 negatively regulates the RPL11-HDM2-p53 nucleolar stress response pathway and suppresses induction of p53-mediated cellular senescence. This work identifies nuclear PRAS40 as a dual-input signaling checkpoint that links cell growth and proliferation to inhibition of cellular senescence. These findings may help to explain the protumorigenic effect of PRAS40 and identify the PRAS40-RPL11 complex as a promising target for p53-restorative anticancer drug discovery.'"

Despite an important role of mTORC1 in platelet function, little is known about how it is regulated. The objective of this study was to determine the signaling pathways that regulate mTORC1 in human platelets.\n\nMETHODS: Mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 activation was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of its downstream substrate ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K).\n\nRESULTS: Thrombin or the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbal 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated activation of mTORC1 in a PKC-dependent, Akt-independent manner that correlated with phosphorylation of tuberin/tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) (Ser939 and Thr1462). In contrast, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-stimulated TSC2 phosphorylation was completely dependent on phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3 kinase)/Akt but did not result in any detectable mTORC1 activation. Early (Ser939 and Thr1462) and late (Thr1462) TSC2 phosphorylation in response to thrombin were directly PKC dependent, whereas later TSC2 (Ser939) and p70S6K phosphorylation were largely dependent on paracrine signaling through P2Y(12). PKC-mediated adenosine diphosphate (ADP) secretion was essential for thrombin-stimulated mTORC1 activation, as (i) ADP rescued p70S6K phosphorylation in the presence of a PKC inhibitor and (ii) P2Y(12) antagonism prevented thrombin-mediated mTORC1 activation. Rescue of mTORC1 activation with exogenous ADP was completely dependent on the Src family kinases but independent of PI3 kinase/Akt. Interestingly, although inhibition of Src blocked the ADP rescue, it had little effect on thrombin-stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation under conditions where PKC was not inhibited.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that thrombin activates the mTORC1 pathway in human platelets through PKC-mediated ADP secretion and subsequent activation of P2Y(12), in a manner largely independent of the canonical PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.'"

Although its effects on cancer are significant, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we sought to elucidate possible links between ginsenoside Rh2 and phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine motility factor (PGI/AMF).\n\nMETHODS: KG1α, a leukemia cell line highly expressing PGI/AMF was assessed by western blot analysis and reverse transcription- PCR (RT-PCR) assay after transfection of a small interfering (si)-RNA to silence PGI/AMF. The effect of PGI/ AMF on proliferation was measured by typan blue assay and antibody array. A cell counting kit (CCK)-8 and flow cytometry (FCM) were adopted to investigate the effects of Rh2 on PGI/AMF. The relationships between PGI/AMF and Rh2 associated with Akt, mTOR, Raptor, Rag were detected by western blot analysis.\n\nRESULTS: KG1α cells expressed PGI/AMF and its down-regulation significantly inhibited proliferation. The antibody array indicated that the probable mechanism was reduced expression of PARP, State1, SAPK/JNK and Erk1/2, while those of PRAS40 and p38 were up-regulated. Silencing of PGI/AMF enhanced the sensibility of KG1α to Rh2 by suppressing the expression of mTOR, Raptor and Akt.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results suggested that ginsenoside Rh2 suppressed the proliferation of KG1α, the same as down-regulation of PGI/AMF.

Our results show that gene transfer of PRAS40 reduced infarction size in rats by promoting phosphorylation of Akt, FKHR (FOXO1), PRAS40, and mTOR. In contrast, PRAS40 KO increased infarction size. Although the PRAS40 KO under normal condition did not alter baseline levels of phosphorylated proteins in the Akt and mTOR pathways, PRAS40 KO that underwent stroke exhibited reduced protein levels of p-S6K and p-S6 in the mTOR pathway but not p-Akt, or p-PTEN in the Akt pathway. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation suggests that there were less interactive effects between Akt and mTOR in the PRAS40 KO.

However, insulin-mediated Akt-phosphorylation was increased upon over-expression of WT-PRAS40 both in hSkMC and mouse skeletal muscle. Also over-expression of AAA-PRAS40 had an insulin-sensitizing effect, although to a lesser extent as WT-PRAS40. The insulin-sensitizing effect associated with increased IRS1 protein abundance and inhibition of proteasome activity. Finally, over-expression of WT-PRAS40 reversed hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study identifies PRAS40 as a regulator of insulin sensitivity in hSkMC.

Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of LY2584702 in combination with erlotinib or everolimus.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumours were treated with a total daily dose of 50-200mg of LY2584702 in combination with erlotinib 150 mg once daily (Arm A) or everolimus 10mg once daily (Arm B). Dose escalation was based on 3+3 design and used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled, 17 in Arm A and 12 in Arm B. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cycle 1 were observed in Arm A in four patients and consisted of Grade 3 vomiting, hypophosphataemia, pulmonary embolism and decreased clotting factor V. No DLTs were observed in Arm B at cycle 1, and the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events related to study drug were: fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Seven patients received ≥4 cycles (3 in A, 4 in B). Best overall response was stable disease. Exposure accumulation of LY2584702 occurred with BID (twice daily) dosing. Exposure of erlotinib increased when administered in combination with LY2584702.\n\nCONCLUSION: LY2584702 was not well tolerated when administered with erlotinib, therefore this combination is not feasible. The combination with everolimus was better tolerated but yielded very limited clinical benefit.'"

The functional role of PDK1 or the importance of phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 for its activity has not been investigated in human platelets. In this study, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of PDK1, BX795 and BX912, to assess the role of Thr308 phosphorylation on Akt. PAR4-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 was inhibited by BX795 without affecting phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473. The lack of Thr308 phosphorylation on Akt also led to the inhibition of PAR4-induced phosphorylation of two downstream substrates of Akt, viz. GSK3β and PRAS40. In vitro kinase activity of Akt was completely abolished if Thr308 on Akt was not phosphorylated. BX795 caused inhibition of 2-MeSADP-induced or collagen-induced aggregation, ATP secretion and thromboxane generation. Primary aggregation induced by 2-MeSADP was also inhibited in the presence of BX795. PDK1 inhibition also resulted in reduced clot retraction indicating its role in outside-in signalling. These results demonstrate that PDK1 selectively phosphorylates Thr308 on Akt thereby regulating its activity and plays a positive regulatory role in platelet physiological responses.'"

PRAS40 is one of the downstream targets of activated Akt that was reported to involve in lipid metabolism in hepatic cells. However, it is still not clear whether PRAS40 is also involved in the renal lipogenesis of diabetes. Our study revealed that phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 known as inactivated style increased in renal tubular cells of diabetic rats accompanied with over-expression of phospho-Akt, SREBP-1, and ADRP. In addition, in vitro experiment also found that high glucose enhanced expression of phospho-PRAS40-Thr246 followed by increased SREBP-1 and lipid droplets in HKC cells. After treated with LY294002, high glucose-induced HKC cells showed decreased phospho-PRAS40-Thr246, phospho-Akt-Ser473, and SREBP-1. Furthermore, wild type PRAS40 vector-caused increased phospho-PRAS40-Thr246 exaggerated lipid deposits in high glucose-treated HKC cells, which was effectively prevented in cells transfected with mutant PRAS40 vector (T246A).

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the RhoA GTPase modulates signaling through mTORC1 in mammalian cells. In support of this hypothesis, exogenous overexpression of either wild type or constitutively active (ca)RhoA repressed mTORC1 signaling as assessed by phosphorylation of p70S6K1 (Thr389), 4E-BP1 (Ser65) and ULK1 (Ser757). Additionally, RhoA·GTP repressed phosphorylation of mTORC1-associated mTOR (Ser2481). The RhoA·GTP mediated repression of mTORC1 signaling occurred independent of insulin or leucine induced stimulation. In contrast to the action of Rho1 in yeast, no evidence was found to support a direct interaction of RhoA·GTP with mTORC1. Instead, expression of caRheb, but not caRags, was able to rescue the RhoA·GTP mediated repression of mTORC1 suggesting RhoA functions upstream of Rheb to repress mTORC1 activity. Consistent with this suggestion, RhoA·GTP repressed phosphorylation of TSC2 (Ser939), PRAS40 (Thr246), Akt (Ser473), and mTORC2-associated mTOR (Ser2481). Overall, the results support a model in which RhoA·GTP represses mTORC1 signaling upstream of Akt and mTORC2.'"

Deregulation of mTOR signaling occurs during and contributes to the severity of myocardial damage from ischemic heart disease. However, the relative roles of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage are unknown.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Combined pharmacological and molecular approaches were used to alter the balance of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to conditions that mimic ischemic heart disease. The importance of mTOR signaling in cardiac protection was demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with Torin1, which led to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. Predominant mTORC1 signaling mediated by suppression of mTORC2 with Rictor similarly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. In comparison, preferentially shifting toward mTORC2 signaling by inhibition of mTORC1 with PRAS40 led to decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selectively increasing mTORC2 while concurrently inhibiting mTORC1 signaling is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.'"

Here, we examined the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in inhibition of CR.\n\nMETHODS: A mutated class I major histocompatibility complex molecule that eliminates CR was delivered into ACI recipients of Wistar-Furth hearts at the time of transplantation with subtherapeutic cyclosporine (10 mg/kg on days 0-2). Controls included untreated and cyclosporine A-treated (10 mg/kg on days 0-2) heart allograft recipients.\n\nRESULTS: Western blotting and immunostaining showed that rat heart allografts with abolished CR exhibited down-regulation of the RAPA-sensitive mTORC1 components such as mTOR and Raptor and down-regulation of the RAPA-insensitive mTORC2 elements Rictor and Sin1. The mTOR regulator Deptor and its downstream target Rac1 were also inhibited.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Abrogation of CR in rat model system involves modulation of two mTOR pathways: a RAPA-sensitive mTORC1 pathway regulating cellular proliferation and a RAPA-insensitive mTORC2 pathway regulating T-cell motility. Selective targeting of T-cell actin cytoskeletal pathways shows potential for pathway-targeted immunosuppression therapies.'"

We also explored the mechanisms behind the complement-mediated tumor growth acceleration that we observed and an approach to overcome it.\n\nRESULTS: Serologically detectable levels of IgM-mAb against GM2 are able to delay or prevent tumor growth of high GM2 expressing cell lines both in vitro and in a SCID mouse model, whereas very low levels of this mAb resulted in slight but consistent acceleration of tumor growth in both settings. Surprisingly, this is not restricted to IgM mAb targeting GM2 but consistent against an IgG mAb targeting GD3 as well. These findings were mirrored by in vitro studies with antibodies against these antigens as well as GD2 and CD20 (with Rituxan), and shown to be complement-dependent in all cases. Complement-mediated accelerated growth of cultured tumor cell lines initiated by low mAb levels was associated with activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT survival pathway and significantly elevated levels of both p-AKT and p-PRAS40. This complement-mediated PI3K activation and accelerated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo are eliminated by PI3K inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 and Wortmannin. These PI3K inhibitors also significantly increased efficacy of high doses of these four mAbs.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that manipulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and its signaling network can significantly increase the potency of passively administered mAbs and vaccine-induced antibodies targeting a variety of tumor cell surface antigens.'"

Incubation of A14 fibroblasts overexpressing human PRAS40 (hPRAS40) resulted in nuclear accumulation of the protein. Furthermore, mutation of the NES mimicked the effects of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of nuclear export, on the subcellular localization of hPRAS40. Finally, A14 cells expressing the NES-mutant showed impaired activation of components of the Akt-pathway as well as of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6 kinase after insulin stimulation. This impaired insulin signaling could be ascribed to reduced protein levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 in cells expressing mutant NES.

Yet the cellular functions of PRAS40 are incompletely defined. This study assessed the function of PRAS40 in insulin action in primary human skeletal muscle cells (hSkMC).\n\nMETHODS: Insulin action was examined in hSkMC following small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of PRAS40 (also known as AKT1S1) under normal conditions and following chemokine-induced insulin resistance.\n\nRESULTS: PRAS40 knockdown (PRAS40-KD) in hSkMC decreased insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt by 50% (p < 0.05) as well as of the Akt substrates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (40%) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (32%) (both p < 0.05). Furthermore, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was reduced by 20% in PRAS40-KD myotubes (p < 0.05). Exposing PRAS40-KD myotubes to chemokines caused no additional deterioration of insulin action. PRAS40-KD further reduced insulin-mediated phosphorylation of the mTORC1-regulated proteins p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) (47%), S6 (43%), and eukaryotic elongation 4E-binding protein 1 (100%), as well as protein levels of growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (35%) (all p < 0.05). The inhibition of insulin action in PRAS40-KD myotubes was associated with a reduction in IRS1 protein levels (60%) (p < 0.05), and was reversed by pharmacological proteasome inhibition. Accordingly, expression of the genes encoding E3-ligases F-box protein 32 (also known as atrogin-1) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 and activity of the proteasome was elevated in PRAS40-KD myotubes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of insulin action in PRAS40-KD myotubes was found to associate with IRS1 degradation promoted by increased proteasome activity rather than hyperactivation of the p70S6K-negative-feedback loop.

DYRK3 displays a cyclic partitioning mechanism between stress granules and the cytosol via a low-complexity domain in its N terminus and its kinase activity. When DYRK3 is inactive, it prevents stress granule dissolution and the release of sequestered mTORC1.

AKT1S1,22879939,"""Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) promotes glomerular hypertrophy and matrix expansion, leading to glomerulosclerosis. MicroRNAs are well suited to promote fibrosis because they can repress gene expression, which negatively regulate the fibrotic process. Recent cellular and animal studies have revealed enhanced expression of microRNA, miR-21, in renal cells in response to TGFβ. Specific miR-21 targets downstream of TGFβ receptor activation that control cell hypertrophy and matrix protein expression have not been studied. Using 3'UTR-driven luciferase reporter, we identified the tumor suppressor protein PTEN as a target of TGFβ-stimulated miR-21 in glomerular mesangial cells. Expression of miR-21 Sponge, which quenches endogenous miR-21 levels, reversed TGFβ-induced suppression of PTEN. Additionally, miR-21 Sponge inhibited TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt kinase, resulting in attenuation of phosphorylation of its substrate GSK3β. Tuberin and PRAS40, two other Akt substrates, and endogenous inhibitors of mTORC1, regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy. Neutralization of endogenous miR-21 abrogated TGFβ-stimulated phosphorylation of tuberin and PRAS40, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of S6 kinase, mTOR and 4EBP-1. Moreover, downregulation of miR-21 significantly suppressed TGFβ-induced protein synthesis and hypertrophy, which were reversed by siRNA-targeted inhibition of PTEN expression. Similarly, expression of constitutively active Akt kinase reversed the miR-21 Sponge-mediated inhibition of TGFβ-induced protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active mTORC1 prevented the miR-21 Sponge-induced suppression of mesangial cell protein synthesis and hypertrophy by TGFβ. Finally, we show that miR-21 Sponge inhibited TGFβ-stimulated fibronectin and collagen expression. Suppression of PTEN expression and expression of both constitutively active Akt kinase and mTORC1 independently reversed this miR-21-mediated inhibition of TGFβ-induced fibronectin and collagen expression. Our results uncover an essential role of TGFβ-induced expression of miR-21, which targets PTEN to initiate a non-canonical signaling circuit involving Akt/mTORC1 axis for mesangial cell hypertrophy and matrix protein synthesis."""

We show that the CCN4 protein, Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), is initially up-regulated by Aβ and can modulate its endogenous expression for the protection of microglia during Aβ mediated apoptosis. WISP1 activates mTOR and phosphorylates p70S6K and 4EBP1 through the control of the regulatory mTOR component PRAS40. Loss of PRAS40 through gene reduction or inhibition by WISP1 is cytoprotective. WISP1 ultimately governs PRAS40 by sequestering PRAS40 intracellularly through post-translational phosphorylation and binding to protein 14-3-3.

We identified 1288 unique phosphosites on 699 different proteins with 99% certainty of correct peptide identification and phosphorylation site localization. Of these, 121 sites on 79 proteins had their phosphorylation levels significantly changed by Ang-(1-7).

In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 in PC12 cells and explored the signaling pathway responsible for the effect of IGF-1. IGF-1 induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr473 and PRAS40 at Thr246 in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 (100ng/ml) was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) specific inhibitor LY294002 (50μM), while no inhibitory effect was observed for a MAPK kinase pathway specific inhibitor PD98059 nor a p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PRAS40 induced by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway in PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons. In further support this hypothesis, an Akt kinase specific inhibitor, Akt inhibitor VIII, attenuated IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40 at the concentration that blocked the phosphorylation of Akt induced by IGF-1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulates the phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr246 in neuronal cells and the effect of IGF-1 is mediated, at least in part, by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.'"
AKT1S1,22354785,"'The proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) acts at the intersection of the Akt- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling pathways. The protein kinase mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two distinct signaling complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, that link energy and nutrients to the regulation of cellular growth and energy metabolism. Activation of mTOR in response to nutrients and growth factors results in the phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including the phosphorylations of S6 kinase by mTORC1 and Akt by mTORC2. Alterations in Akt and mTOR activity have been linked to the progression of multiple diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. Although PRAS40 was first reported as substrate for Akt, investigations toward mTOR-binding partners subsequently identified PRAS40 as both component and substrate of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by Akt and by mTORC1 itself results in dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and may relieve an inhibitory constraint on mTORC1 activity. Adding to the complexity is that gene silencing studies indicate that PRAS40 is also necessary for the activity of the mTORC1 complex. This review summarizes the regulation and potential function(s) of PRAS40 in the complex Akt- and mTOR-signaling network in health and disease.'"

Inactivating CDC73 mutations have also been implicated in sporadic parathyroid cancer, but are rare in sporadic benign parathyroid tumors. The molecular pathways that distinguish malignant from benign parathyroid transformation remain elusive. We previously showed that a hypomorphic allele of hyrax (hyx), the Drosophila homolog of CDC73, rescues the loss-of-ventral-eye phenotype of lobe, encoding the fly homolog of Akt1s1/ PRAS40. We report now an interaction between hyx and Tor, a central regulator of cell growth and autophagy, and show that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP), a translational repressor and effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is a conserved target of hyx/CDC73. Flies heterozygous for Tor and hyx, but not Mnn1, the homolog of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) tumor suppressor associated with benign parathyroid tumors, are starvation resistant with reduced basal levels of Thor/4E-BP. Human peripheral blood cell levels of EIF4EBP3 were reduced in patients with CDC73, but not MEN1, heterozygosity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated occupancy of EIF4EBP3 by endogenous parafibromin. These results show that EIF4EBP3 is a peripheral marker of CDC73 function distinct from MEN1-regulated pathways, and suggest a model whereby starvation resistance and/or translational de-repression contributes to parathyroid malignant transformation.'"
AKT1S1,22275758,"'The final number of Sertoli cells reached during the proliferative periods determines sperm production capacity in adulthood. It is well known that FSH is the major Sertoli cell mitogen; however, little is known about the signal transduction pathways that regulate the proliferation of Sertoli cells. The hypothesis of this investigation was that FSH regulates proliferation through a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, and additionally, AMPK-dependent mechanisms counteract FSH proliferative effects. The present study was performed in 8-day-old rat Sertoli cell cultures. The results presented herein show that FSH, in addition to increasing p-Akt, p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K levels, increases p-PRAS40 levels, probably contributing to improving mTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, the decrease in FSH-stimulated p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-PRAS40 levels in the presence of wortmannin emphasizes the participation of PI3K in FSH signaling. Additionally, the inhibition of FSH-stimulated Sertoli cell proliferation by the effect of wortmannin and rapamycin point to the relevance of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway in the mitotic activity of FSH. On the other hand, by activating AMPK, several interesting observations were made. Activation of AMPK produced an increase in Raptor phosphorylation, a decrease in p70S6K phosphorylation, and a decrease in FSH-stimulated Sertoli cell proliferation. The decrease in FSH-stimulated cell proliferation was accompanied by an increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p19INK4d, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1. In summary, it is concluded that FSH regulates Sertoli cell proliferation with the participation of a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway and that AMPK activation may be involved in the detention of proliferation by, at least in part, a decrease in mTORC1 signaling and an increase in CDKI expression.'"
AKT1S1,22241085,"""Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are highly aggressive and highly metastatic tumors caused by a chromosomal fusion between the Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS) with the transcription factor FLI-1. However, expression of the EWS/FLI-1 chimeric oncogene by itself is insufficient for carcinogenesis, suggesting that additional events are required. Here, we report the identification of the Akt substrate PRAS40 as an EWS target gene. EWS negatively regulates PRAS40 expression by binding the 3' untranslated region in PRAS40 mRNA. ESFT cell proliferation was suppressed by treatment with an Akt inhibitor, and ESFT cell proliferation and metastatic growth were suppressed by siRNA-mediated PRAS40 knockdown. Furthermore, PRAS40 knockdown was sufficient to reverse an increased cell proliferation elicited by EWS knockdown. In support of a pathologic role for PRAS40 elevation in EFST, we documented inverse protein levels of EWS and PRAS40 in ESFT cells. Together, our findings suggest that PRAS40 promotes the development of ESFT and might therefore represent a novel therapeutic target in this aggressive disease."""

Starting from a single human AFS cell, EBs can be formed accompanied by the differentiation into cells of all three embryonic germ layers. Here, we report that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2) gene product tuberin or of proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), the two major negative regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), leads to massive apoptotic cell death during EB development of human AFS cells without affecting the endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal cell differentiation spectrum. Co-knockdown of endogenous mTOR demonstrated these effects to be mTOR-dependent. Our findings prove this enzyme cascade to be an essential anti-apoptotic gatekeeper of stem-cell differentiation during EB formation. These data allow new insights into the regulation of early stem-cell maintenance and differentiation and identify a new role of the tumor suppressor tuberin and the oncogenic protein PRAS40 with the relevance for a more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases associated with altered activities of these gene products.'"

The CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis has been implicated in both cancer metastases and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and a more complete understanding of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathways may support efforts to develop therapeutics for these diseases. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics has emerged as an important tool in studying signaling networks in an unbiased fashion. We employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative phosphoproteomics to examine the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in the human lymphoblastic CEM cell line. We quantified 4,074 unique SILAC pairs from 1,673 proteins and 89 phosphopeptides were deemed CXCL12-responsive in biological replicates. Several well established CXCL12-responsive phosphosites such as AKT (pS473) and ERK2 (pY204) were confirmed in our study. We also validated two novel CXCL12-responsive phosphosites, stathmin (pS16) and AKT1S1 (pT246) by Western blot. Pathway analysis and comparisons with other phosphoproteomic datasets revealed that genes from CXCL12-responsive phosphosites are enriched for cellular pathways such as T cell activation, epidermal growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, pathways which have previously been linked to CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Several of the novel CXCL12-responsive phosphoproteins from our study have also been implicated with cellular migration and HIV-1 infection, thus providing an attractive list of potential targets for the development of cancer metastasis and HIV-1 therapeutics and for furthering our understanding of chemokine signaling regulation by reversible phosphorylation.'"
AKT1S1,21914810,"'Insulin activation of mTOR complex 1 is accompanied by enhanced binding of substrates. We examined the mechanism and contribution of this enhancement to insulin activation of mTORC1 signaling in 293E and HeLa cells. In 293E, insulin increased the amount of mTORC1 retrieved by the transiently expressed nonphosphorylatable 4E-BP[5A] to an extent that varied inversely with the amount of PRAS40 bound to mTORC1. RNAi depletion of PRAS40 enhanced 4E-BP[5A] binding to ∼70% the extent of maximal insulin, and PRAS40 RNAi and insulin together did not increase 4E-BP[5A] binding beyond insulin alone, suggesting that removal of PRAS40 from mTORC1 is the predominant mechanism of an insulin-induced increase in substrate access. As regards the role of increased substrate access in mTORC1 signaling, RNAi depletion of PRAS40, although increasing 4E-BP[5A] binding, did not stimulate phosphorylation of endogenous mTORC1 substrates S6K1(Thr(389)) or 4E-BP (Thr(37)/Thr(46)), the latter already ∼70% of maximal in amino acid replete, serum-deprived 293E cells. In HeLa cells, insulin and PRAS40 RNAi also both enhanced the binding of 4E-BP[5A] to raptor but only insulin stimulated S6K1 and 4E-BP phosphorylation. Furthermore, Rheb overexpression in 293E activated mTORC1 signaling completely without causing PRAS40 release. In the presence of Rheb and insulin, PRAS40 release is abolished by Akt inhibition without diminishing mTORC1 signaling. In conclusion, dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and enhanced mTORC1 substrate binding results from Akt and mTORC1 activation and makes little or no contribution to mTORC1 signaling, which rather is determined by Rheb activation of mTOR catalytic activity, through mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated.'"
AKT1S1,21910584,"'Resistance of cancer cells to ionizing radiation plays an important role in the clinical setting of lung cancer treatment. To date, however, the exact molecular mechanism of radiosensitivity has not been well explained. In this study, we compared radioresistance in two types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, NCI-H460 and A549, and investigated the signaling pathways that confer radioresistance. In radioresistant cells, exposure to radiation led to overexpression of PIM1 and reduction of protein phosphatases (PP2A and PP5), which induced translocation of PIM1 into the nucleus. Increased nuclear PIM1 phosphorylated PRAS40. Consequently, pPRAS40 made a trimeric complex with 14-3-3 and AKT-activated pFOXO3a, which then moved rapidly to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic retention of FOXO3a was associated with downregulation of proapoptotic genes and possibly radioresistance. On the other hand, no suppressive effect of radiation on protein phosphatases was detected and, concomitantly, protein phosphatases downregulated PIM1 in radiosensitive cells. In this setting, PIM1-activated pPRAS40, AKT-activated pFOXO3a, and their complex formation with 14-3-3 could be key regulators of the radiation-induced radioresistance in NSCLC cells.'"

PRAS40 is known for its ability to regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase activity, possessing a key regulatory role at the cross point of signal transduction pathways activated by growth factor receptors. Recently it has been found that PRAS40 is regulated by its upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) which is activated by many tyrosine kinase receptors growth factors including insulin-like growth factor 1.

Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by Akt and mTORC1 disrupts the binding between mTORC1 and PRAS40, and relieves the inhibitory constraint of PRAS40 on mTORC1 activity. This review summarizes the signaling regulating PRAS40 phosphorylation, as well as the dual function of PRAS40 as substrate and inhibitor of mTORC1 upon growth factor stimulation and under pathophysiological conditions.'"
AKT1S1,21886838,"'Malignancy is a major problem in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents. We have demonstrated that treatment with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) can induce the activation of proto-oncogenic Ras, and may promote a rapid progression of human renal cancer through the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Interestingly, we found that CNI-induced VEGF overexpression and cancer cell proliferation was inhibited by rapamycin treatment, indicating potential involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in this tumorigenic process. Here, we examined the role of mTOR pathway in mediating CNI- and Ras-induced overexpression of VEGF in human renal cancer cells (786-0 and Caki-1). We found that the knockdown of raptor (using siRNA) significantly decreased CNI-induced VEGF promoter activity as observed by promoter-luciferase assay, suggesting the role of mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) in CNI-induced VEGF transcription. It is known that mTOR becomes activated following phosphorylation of its negative regulator PRAS40, which is a part of mTORC1. We observed that CNI treatment and activation of H-Ras (through transfection of an active H-Ras plasmid) markedly increased the phosphorylation of PRAS40, and the transfection of cells using a dominant-negative plasmid of Ras, significantly decreased PRAS40 phosphorylation. Protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ and PKC-δ, which are critical intermediary signaling molecules for CNI-induced tumorigenic pathway, formed complex with PRAS40; and we found that the CNI treatment increased the complex formation between PRAS40 and PKC, particularly (PKC)-ζ. Inhibition of PKC activity using pharmacological inhibitor markedly decreased H-Ras-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40. The overexpression of PRAS40 in renal cancer cells significantly down-regulated CNI- and H-Ras-induced VEGF transcriptional activation. Finally, it was observed that CNI treatment increased the expression of phosho-PRAS40 in renal tumor tissues in vivo. Together, the phosphorylation of PRAS40 is critical for the activation of mTOR in CNI-induced VEGF overexpression and renal cancer progression.'"
AKT1S1,21618507,"'Lung cancer is one of the most commonly occurring malignancies. It has been reported that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is phosphorylated in lung cancer and its activation was more frequent in tumors with overexpression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. Therefore, dual inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling could be valuable agents for treating lung cancer. In the present study, we show that fisetin, a dietary tetrahydroxyflavone inhibits cell growth with the concomitant suppression of PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling in human nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Using autodock 4, we found that fisetin physically interacts with the mTOR complex at two sites. Fisetin treatment was also found to reduce the formation of A549 cell colonies in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with fisetin caused decrease in the protein expression of PI3K (p85 and p110), inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K1, eIF-4E and 4E-BP1. Fisetin-treated cells also exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of the constituents of mTOR signaling complex such as Rictor, Raptor, GβL and PRAS40. There was an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPKα and a decrease in the phosphorylation of TSC2 on treatment of cells with fisetin. We also found that treatment of cells with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and mTOR-siRNA caused decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR and its target proteins which were further downregulated on treatment with fisetin, suggesting that these effects are mediated in part, through mTOR signaling. Our results show that fisetin suppressed PI3K/Akt and mTOR signaling in NSCLC cells and thus, could be developed as a chemotherapeutic agent against human lung cancer.'"

In this study, we investigated the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-2 in Akt regulation using the recently identified small molecule ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors PP242 and Torin1. Both PP242 and Torin1 blocked thrombin and insulin-like growth factor 1-mediated Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation with an IC(50) between 1 and 5 nm, whereas the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin had no effect. Interestingly, PP242 and Torin1 had no effect on Akt Thr(308) phosphorylation, Akt1 activity, and phosphorylation of the Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase 3β, indicating that Ser(473) phosphorylation is not necessary for Thr(308) phosphorylation and maximal Akt1 activity. In contrast, Akt2 activity was significantly reduced, concurrent with inhibition of PRAS40 phosphorylation, in the presence of PP242 and Torin1. Other signaling pathways, including phospholipase C/PKC and the MAPK pathway, were unaffected by PP242 and Torin1. Together, these results demonstrate that mTORC2 is the kinase that phosphorylates Akt Ser(473) in human platelets but that this phosphorylation is dispensable for Thr(308) phosphorylation and Akt1 activity.'"

In nephropathy, associated with diabetes, increased Akt signal transduction results in glomerular especially mesangial cell hypertrophy. The mechanism of Akt activation by elevated glucose is poorly understood. The oncogene DJ-1 prevents oxidative damage and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease and in culture. We identified DJ-1 to increase in response to high glucose in renal glomerular mesangial cells concomitant with an increase in phosphorylation of Akt in a time-dependent manner. Plasmid-derived overexpression as well as downregulation of DJ-1 by siRNA showed the requirement of this protein in high glucose-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The tumor suppressor protein PTEN acts as a negative regulator of Akt activation. Interestingly, DJ-1 was associated with PTEN and this interaction was significantly increased in response to high glucose. High glucose-induced increase in DJ-1 promoted phosphorylation of the PRAS40, a negative regulator of TORC1 kinase activity, resulting in activating and inactivating phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4EBP-1, respectively. Furthermore, DJ-1 increased protein synthesis and hypertrophy of mesangial cells. Our results provide evidence for a unique mechanism whereby DJ-1 induces Akt/PRAS40/TORC1-mediated hypertrophy in response to high glucose."""

Rat livers were perfused with medium containing various concentrations of insulin and/or amino acids. At fasting (1×) or 2× (2×AA) concentrations of amino acids, insulin maximally stimulated Akt phosphorylation but had no effect on global rates of protein synthesis. In the absence of insulin, 4×AA produced a moderate stimulation of protein synthesis and activation of mTORC1. The combination of 4×AA and insulin produced a maximal stimulation of protein synthesis and activation of mTORC1. These effects were accompanied by decreases in raptor and PRAS40 and an increase in RagC associated with mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The studies were extended to a cell culture model in which mTORC1 activity was repressed by deprivation of leucine and serum, and resupplementation with the amino acid and insulin acted in an additive manner to restore mTORC1 activation. In deprived cells, mTORC1 was activated by expressing either constitutively active (ca) Rheb or a caRagB·caRagC complex, and coexpression of the constructs had an additive effect. Notably, resupplementation with leucine in cells expressing caRheb or with insulin in cells expressing the caRagB·caRagC complex was as effective as resupplementation with both leucine and insulin in non-transfected cells. Moreover, changes in mTORC1 activity correlated directly with altered association of mTOR with RagB/RagC, Rheb, raptor, and PRAS40. Overall, the results suggest that amino acids signal through the Rag complex and insulin through Rheb to achieve coordinate activation of mTORC1.'"

We quantified 375 nonredundant PI3K pathway-relevant phosphopeptides, all containing AKT, PDK1, or mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate recognition motifs. Of these phosphopeptides, 71 were drug-regulated, 11 of them by all three inhibitors. Drug-modulated phosphoproteins were enriched for involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization (filamin, stathmin, dynamin, PAK4, and PTPN14), vesicle transport (LARP1, VPS13D, and SLC20A1), and protein translation (S6RP and PRAS40). We then generated phosphospecific antibodies against selected, drug-regulated phosphorylation sites that would be suitable as biomarker tools for PI3K pathway inhibitors.

Evaluation of binding of this antibody in human cancer cell lines, a PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10)-deficient mouse prostate tumor model, and triple-negative breast tumor tissues showed that phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) positively correlates with PI3K pathway activation and predicts AKT inhibitor sensitivity. In contrast to phosphorylation of AKT(Thr308), the phospho-PRAS40(Thr246) epitope is highly stable in tissue samples and thus is ideal for immunohistochemistry.

Streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal hypertrophy was associated with phosphorylation of PRAS40 in the cortex and glomeruli. In vitro, high glucose concentration increased PRAS40 phosphorylation in a PI 3 kinase- and Akt-dependent manner, resulting in dissociation of raptor-PRAS40 complex in mesangial cells. High glucose augmented the inactivating and activating phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 and S6 kinase, respectively, with concomitant induction of protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Expression of TORC1-nonphosphorylatable mutant of 4EBP-1 and dominant-negative S6 kinase significantly inhibited high glucose-induced protein synthesis and hypertrophy. PRAS40 knockdown mimicked the effect of high glucose on phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 and S6 kinase, protein synthesis, and hypertrophy. To elucidate the role of PRAS40 phosphorylation, we used phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PRAS40, which in contrast to PRAS40 knockdown inhibited phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 and S6 kinase, leading to reduced mesangial cell hypertrophy.

In this study we report that a hypomorphic allele of hyrax (hyx), the Drosophila homolog of HRPT2/CDC73, rescues the loss-of-ventral-eye phenotype of lobe (Akt1s1). Such rescue is consistent with previous reports that hyx/parafibromin is required for the nuclear transduction of Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signals and that Wg signaling antagonizes lobe function. A screen using double hyx/lobe heterozygotes identified an additional interaction with orb and orb2, the homologs of mammalian cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), a translational regulatory protein. Hyx and orb2 heterozygotes lived longer and were more resistant to starvation than controls. In mammalian cells, knockdown of parafibromin expression reduced levels of CPEB1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed occupancy of CPEB1 by endogenous parafibromin. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant overlap between human transcripts potentially regulated by parafibromin and CPEB.

Phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 by PKB/Akt, and PRAS40-Ser183 and PRAS40-Ser221 by mTORC1 results in dissociation from mTORC1, and its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Although all phosphorylation sites within PRAS40 have been implicated in 14-3-3 binding, substitution of Thr246 by Ala alone is sufficient to abolish 14-3-3 binding under conditions of intact mTORC1 signalling. This suggests that phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 may facilitate efficient phosphorylation of PRAS40 on its mTORC1-dependent sites. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation in response to insulin. Insulin promoted PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation after a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp in human skeletal muscle. The insulin-induced PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation was further evidenced in vivo in rat skeletal and cardiac muscle, and in vitro in A14 fibroblasts, 3T3L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or amino acid deprivation partially abrogated insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation in cultured cell lines. However, lowering insulin-induced PRAS40-Thr246 phosphorylation using wortmannin or palmitate in cell lines, or by feeding rats a high-fat diet, completely abolished insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation. In addition, replacement of Thr246 by Ala reduced insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation.

In addition, we used rabbit anti-PRAS40 antibody and the phosphorylated PRAS40 (Ser183) antibody to detect PRAS40 expression in several cell lines, including the normal cells HL7702, HEK293, tumor cells HepG2, A549 and S180. There were no quite difference among these cells; otherwise, we observed the decreased phosphorylation level of Ser183 after amino acid withdrawal treatment. Therefore, the polyclonal phosphorylated PRAS40 (Ser183) antibody was specific to PRAS40 (Ser183) site and could be used for the function study of PRAS40.'"
AKT1S1,19480563,"'Alterations in signalling via protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) frequently occur in type 2 diabetes and various human malignancies. Proline-rich Akt substrate of 40-kDa (PRAS40) has a regulatory function at the intersection of these pathways. The interaction of PRAS40 with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibits the activity of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by PKB/Akt and mTORC1 disrupts the binding between mTORC1 and PRAS40, and relieves the inhibitory constraint of PRAS40 on mTORC1 activity. This review summarizes the signalling pathways regulating PRAS40 phosphorylation, as well as the dual function of PRAS40 as substrate and inhibitor of mTORC1 in the physiological situation, and under pathological conditions, such as insulin resistance and cancer.'"
AKT1S1,19276681,"'PIM1 is a serine/threonine kinase that has diverse biological roles in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. PIM1 has been implicated in early transformation and tumor progression in haematopoietic malignancies and prostate carcinomas. The ability of PIM1 to regulate these processes is thought to be in part secondary to its activity in stimulating 4EBP1 phosphorylation and enhancement of protein synthesis. Because 4EBP1 is an mTOR substrate, we have investigated how PIM1 might regulate this latter enzyme. We have examined the ability of PIM1 to modulate PRAS40, a protein known to negatively regulate mTOR activity in FDCP1 cells. Upon phosphorylation, PRAS40 dissociates from the mTOR complex and increases mTOR kinase activity. We find that enforced overexpression of PIM1 increases PRAS40 phosphorylation at Thr(246), an AKT phosphorylation site, whether grown in complete media or deprived of IL-3 and serum. The increase in PRAS40 phosphorylation was independent of AKT activation and not inhibited by wortmannin. In vitro kinase assays indicate that the PIM1 protein kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating Thr(246) in PRAS40. PIM1 protein kinase overexpression reduced the association of PRAS40 with mTOR, and increased the mTOR directed phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and p70S6Kinase. Treatment of FDCP1 cells transfected with PIM1 (FD/mpim44) with small molecule inhibitors of PIM1 kinase activity reduced both PRAS40 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. These results suggest that PIM1 regulates mTOR activity through phosphorylation of PRAS40. Thus, increases in mTOR activity mediated by the PIM protein kinase may have the potential to control cell growth.'"
AKT1S1,18372248,"'The rapamycin-sensitive mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) contains mTOR, raptor, mLST8, and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa). PRAS40 functions as a negative regulator when bound to mTORC1, and it dissociates from mTORC1 in response to insulin. PRAS40 has been demonstrated to be a substrate of mTORC1, and one phosphorylation site, Ser-183, has been identified. In this study, we used two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping in conjunction with mutational analysis to show that in addition to Ser-183, mTORC1 also phosphorylates Ser-212 and Ser-221 in PRAS40 when assayed in vitro. Mutation of all three residues to Ala markedly reduces mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 in vitro. All three sites were confirmed to be phosphorylated in vivo by [(32)P]orthophosphate labeling and peptide mapping. Phosphorylation of Ser-221 and Ser-183 but not Ser-212 is sensitive to rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutation of Ser-221 to Ala reduces the interaction with 14-3-3 to the same extent as mutation of Thr-246, the Akt/protein kinase B-phosphorylated site. We also find that mutation of Ser-221 to Ala increases the inhibitory activity of PRAS40 toward mTORC1. We propose that after mTORC1 kinase activation by upstream regulators, PRAS40 is phosphorylated directly by mTOR, thus contributing to the relief of PRAS40-mediated substrate competition.'"
AKT1S1,18215133,"'PRAS40 binds to the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and is released in response to insulin. It has been suggested that this effect is due to 14-3-3 binding and leads to activation of mTORC1 signalling. In a similar manner to insulin, phorbol esters also activate mTORC1 signalling, in this case via PKC (protein kinase C) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase). However, phorbol esters do not induce phosphorylation of PRAS40 at Thr(246), binding of 14-3-3 proteins to PRAS40 or its release from mTORC1. Mutation of Thr(246) to a serine residue permits phorbol esters to induce phosphorylation and binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Such phosphorylation is apparently mediated by RSKs (ribosomal S6 kinases), which lie downstream of ERK. However, although the PRAS40(T246S) mutant binds to 14-3-3 better than wild-type PRAS40, each inhibits mTORC1 signalling to a similar extent. Our results show that activation of mTORC1 signalling by phorbol esters does not require PRAS40 to be phosphorylated at Thr(246), bind to 14-3-3 or be released from mTORC1. It is conceivable that phorbol esters activate mTORC1 by a distinct mechanism not involving PRAS40. Indeed, our results suggest that PRAS40 may not actually be involved in controlling mTORC1, but rather be a downstream target of mTORC1 that is regulated in response only to specific stimuli, such as insulin.'"
AKT1S1,18030348,"'TOR (Target of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of cell growth. TOR is found in two functionally and structurally distinct multiprotein complexes termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) based proteomic strategy to identify new mammalian TOR (mTOR) binding proteins. We report the identification of Proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40) and the hypothetical protein Q6MZQ0/FLJ14213/CAE45978 as new mTOR binding proteins. PRAS40 binds mTORC1 via Raptor, and is an mTOR phosphorylation substrate. PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 autophosphorylation and mTORC1 kinase activity toward eIF-4E binding protein (4E-BP) and PRAS40 itself. HeLa cells in which PRAS40 was knocked down were protected against induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide. Rapamycin failed to mimic the pro-apoptotic effect of PRAS40, suggesting that PRAS40 mediates apoptosis independently of its inhibitory effect on mTORC1. Q6MZQ0 is structurally similar to proline rich protein 5 (PRR5) and was therefore named PRR5-Like (PRR5L). PRR5L binds specifically to mTORC2, via Rictor and/or SIN1. Unlike other mTORC2 members, PRR5L is not required for mTORC2 integrity or kinase activity, but dissociates from mTORC2 upon knock down of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2. Hyperactivation of mTOR by TSC1/2 knock down enhanced apoptosis whereas PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis. PRR5L knock down reduced apoptosis also in mTORC2 deficient cells. The above suggests that mTORC2-dissociated PRR5L may promote apoptosis when mTOR is hyperactive. Thus, PRAS40 and PRR5L are novel mTOR-associated proteins that control the balance between cell growth and cell death.'"

AKT1S1,17604271,"'Signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is positively regulated by amino acids and insulin. PRAS40 associates with mTORC1 (which contains raptor) but not mTORC2. PRAS40 interacts with raptor, and this requires an intact TOR-signaling (TOS) motif in PRAS40. Like TOS motif-containing proteins such as eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), PRAS40 is a substrate for phosphorylation by mTORC1. Consistent with this, starvation of cells of amino acids or treatment with rapamycin alters the phosphorylation of PRAS40. PRAS40 binds 14-3-3 proteins, and this requires both amino acids and insulin. Binding of PRAS40 to 14-3-3 proteins is inhibited by TSC1/2 (negative regulators of mTORC1) and stimulated by Rheb in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This confirms that PRAS40 is a target for regulation by mTORC1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PRAS40 impairs both the amino acid- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation of S6. However, this has no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2 (an Akt substrate). These data place PRAS40 downstream of mTORC1 but upstream of its effectors, such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1.'"
AKT1S1,17517883,"'The proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kilodaltons (PRAS40) was identified as a raptor-binding protein that is phosphorylated directly by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTORC2 in vitro, predominantly at PRAS40 (Ser(183)). The binding of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to raptor requires a TOR signaling (TOS) motif, which contains an essential Phe followed by four alternating acidic and small hydrophobic amino acids. PRAS40 binding to raptor was severely inhibited by mutation of PRAS40 (Phe(129) to Ala). Immediately carboxyl-terminal to Phe(129) are two small hydrophobic amino acid followed by two acidic residues. PRAS40 binding to raptor was also abolished by mutation of the major mTORC1 phosphorylation site, Ser(183), to Asp. PRAS40 (Ser(183)) was phosphorylated in intact cells; this phosphorylation was inhibited by rapamycin, by 2-deoxyglucose, and by overexpression of the tuberous sclerosis complex heterodimer. PRAS40 (Ser(183)) phosphorylation was also inhibited reversibly by withdrawal of all or of only the branched chain amino acids; this inhibition was reversed by overexpression of the Rheb GTPase. Overexpressed PRAS40 suppressed the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at their rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation sites, and reciprocally, overexpression of S6K1 or 4E-BP1 suppressed phosphorylation of PRAS40 (Ser(183)) and its binding to raptor. RNA interference-induced depletion of PRAS40 enhanced the amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1. These results establish PRAS40 as a physiological mTORC1 substrate that contains a variant TOS motif. Moreover, they indicate that the ability of raptor to bind endogenous substrates is limiting for the activity of mTORC1 in vivo and is therefore a potential locus of regulation.'"
AKT1S1,17510057,"'Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.'"

However, the involvement of PRAS40 in the cell death/survival pathway after spinal cord injury (SCI) is unclear. Liposome-mediated PRAS40 transfection was performed to study whether overexpression of pPRAS40 is neuroprotective. We further examined the expression of pPRAS40 after SCI by immunohistochemistry and Western blot using copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic (Tg) rats and wild-type (Wt) littermates. We then examined the relationship between PRAS40 and Akt by injection of LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor, or Akt inhibitor IV, a compound that inhibits Akt activation after SCI. Our data demonstrated that increased pPRAS40 resulted in survival of more motor neurons compared with control complementary DNA transfection. Phosphorylated PRAS40 increased in the Wt rats after SCI, whereas there was a greater and prolonged increase in the SOD1 Tg rats. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that binding of pPRAS40 with 14-3-3 increased 1 day after SCI in the Wt rats, whereas there was a significant increase in the Tg rats. The inhibitor studies showed that phospho-Akt and pPRAS40 were decreased after injection of LY294002 or Akt inhibitor IV. We conclude that an increase in pPRAS40 by transfection after SCI results in survival of motor neurons, and overexpression of SOD1 in the Tg rats results in an increase in endogenous pPRAS40 and a decrease in motor neuron death through the PI3K/Akt pathway.'"
AKT1S1,17440074,"'Malignant melanoma is the most invasive and deadly form of skin cancer with no effective therapy to treat advanced disease, leading to poor survival rates. Akt3 signaling plays an important role in deregulating apoptosis in approximately 70% of melanomas. Thus, targeting Akt3 signaling in melanoma patients has significant therapeutic potential for inhibiting melanomas, but no Akt3-specific chemotherapeutic agent exists. Unfortunately, nonspecific Akt inhibitors can cause systemic toxicity or increase metastasis. Identifying and targeting the Akt3 substrate that deregulates apoptosis might circumvent these complications but would require demonstration of its functional importance in disrupting normal apoptosis. In this study, PRAS40 was identified as an Akt3 substrate that deregulated apoptosis to promote melanoma tumorigenesis. Levels of phosphorylated PRAS40 (pPRAS40) increased during melanoma tumor progression paralleling increasing Akt3 activity. Majority of melanomas from patients with elevated Akt activity also had correspondingly higher levels of pPRAS40. Targeting PRAS40 or upstream Akt3 similarly reduced anchorage-independent growth in culture and inhibited tumor development in mice. Mechanistically, decreased pPRAS40 increased tumor cell apoptosis as well as sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis-inducing agents, thereby decreasing chemoresistance. Collectively, these studies provide a solid mechanistic basis for targeting PRAS40 to inhibit the Akt3 signaling cascade and thereby retard melanoma development.'"

PRAS40 inhibits cell growth, S6K1 phosphorylation, and rheb-induced activation of the mTORC1 pathway, and in vitro it prevents the great increase in mTORC1 kinase activity induced by rheb1-GTP. Insulin stimulates Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40, which prevents its inhibition of mTORC1 in cells and in vitro.

Here, we identify PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt/PKB substrate 40 kDa) as a novel mTOR binding partner that mediates Akt signals to mTOR. PRAS40 binds the mTOR kinase domain and its interaction with mTOR is induced under conditions that inhibit mTOR signalling, such as nutrient or serum deprivation or mitochondrial metabolic inhibition. Binding of PRAS40 inhibits mTOR activity and suppresses constitutive activation of mTOR in cells lacking TSC2. PRAS40 silencing inactivates insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt, and uncouples the response of mTOR to Akt signals. Furthermore, PRAS40 phosphorylation by Akt and association with 14-3-3, a cytosolic anchor protein, are crucial for insulin to stimulate mTOR. These findings identify PRAS40 as an important regulator of insulin sensitivity of the Akt-mTOR pathway and a potential target for the treatment of cancers, insulin resistance and hamartoma syndromes.'"

Tolerant hearts demonstrated increased expression of genes associated with the stress response, modulation of immune function and cell survival (HSPa9a, CD56, and Akt1s1), and decreased expression of several immunoregulatory genes (CD209, CD26, and PDE4b).

In rat and mice, insulin stimulated PRAS40-Thr246 phosphorylation in skeletal and cardiac muscle, the liver, and adipose tissue in vivo. Physiological hyperinsulinemia increased PRAS40-Thr246 phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle biopsies. In cultured cell lines, insulin-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation was prevented by the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies showed that phosphorylated PRAS40 is predominantly localized to the nucleus. Finally, in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD), phosphorylation of PRAS40 was markedly reduced compared with low-fat diet-fed animals in all tissues examined. In conclusion, the current study identifies PRAS40 as a physiological target of in vivo insulin action. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 is increased by insulin in human, rat, and mouse insulin target tissues. In rats, this response is reduced under conditions of HFD-induced insulin resistance."""

Our present study was designed to clarify the relationship between the PRAS signaling pathway and oxidative stress in the regulation of apoptosis after tFCI.\n\nMETHODS: We used a tFCI model with SOD1 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates to examine the expression of phosphorylated PRAS (pPRAS) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and the interaction of pPRAS with phosphorylated Akt (pPRAS/pAkt) or the 14-3-3 protein (pPRAS/14-3-3) by coimmunoprecipitation. Direct oxidation of the carbonyl groups, an indication of oxidative injury to total and individual proteins caused by tFCI, was examined using a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone reaction assay.\n\nRESULTS: Expression of pPRAS, pPRAS/pAkt, and pPRAS/14-3-3 decreased 2 hours after tFCI. Oxidized hydroethidine did not colocalize with expression of pPRAS. Individual oxidized carbonyls in pPRAS remarkably increased 2 hours after tFCI but were significantly reduced by SOD1 2 hours after tFCI. Expression of pPRAS, pPRAS/pAkt, and pPRAS/14-3-3 was promoted by SOD1 during the same time course.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that overexpression of SOD1 may affect the PRAS pathway after tFCI by reducing the direct oxidative reaction to pPRAS after reperfusion injury.'"

The expression of PRAS40, Akt, Raf and 14-3-3 in normal cells and cancer cell lines was determined by Western blot.\n\nRESULTS: The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and Ly294002, but not rapamycin, completely inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and PRAS40. The phosphorylation level of Akt decreased after serum withdrawal and treatment with the MEK inhibitor Uo126, but increased after treatment with H(2)O(2) at low concentration, whereas none of these treatments changed PRAS40 activity. 14-3-3 is a PRAS40 binding protein, and the expression of 14-3-3, like that of PRAS40, was higher in HeLa cells than in HEK293 cells; PRAS40 had a stronger phosphorylation activity in A549 and HeLa cancer cells than in HEK293 normal cells. In the breast cancer model (MCF10A/MCF7) and lung cancer model (BEAS/H1198/H1170) we also found the same result: PRAS40 was constitutively active in H1198/H1170 and MCF7 pre-malignant and malignant cancer cells, but weakly expressed in MCF10A and BEAS normal cell. We also discussed PRAS40 activity in other NSCLC cell lines.\n\nCONCLUSION: The PI3K-Akt survival pathway is the main pathway that PRAS40 is involved in; PRAS40 is a substrate for Akt, but can also be activated by an Akt-independent mechanisms.

Wild-type (WT) and Akr1a mice were injected intraperitoneally with TAA and the extent of liver injury in the acute phase was assessed. Intriguingly, the extent of TAA-induced liver damage was less in the Akr1a mice than in the WT mice. Biomarkers for the ER stress-induced apoptosis pathway were markedly decreased in the livers of Akr1a mice, whereas AsA levels in plasma did not change significantly in any of the mice. In the liver, TAA is converted to reactive metabolites such as TAA S-oxide and then to TAA S, S-dioxide via the action of CYP2E1. In Akr1a mice, CYP2E1 activity was relatively lower than WT mice at the basal level, leading to reactive TAA metabolites being produced at lower levels after the TAA treatment. The levels of liver proteins that were modified with these metabolites were also lower in the Akr1a mice than the WT mice after the TAA treatment. Furthermore, after a lethal dose of a TAA challenge, the WT mice all died within 36\u202fh, whereas almost all of the Akr1a mice survived. These collective results suggest that Akr1a mice are resistant to TAA-induced liver injury, and it follows that the absence of Akr1a might modulate TAA bioactivation.'"

Cell viability, abundances of apoptotic proteins, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSH, and expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of GSH, thioredoxin, and 4-HNE metabolism were determined.\n\nResults: Compared with basal medium containing 0.05 mmol l-glutamine/L, 4-HNE enhanced apoptosis by 19.6% (P\xa0<\xa00.05) in a caspase-3-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied by elevated intracellular ROS production (39.5% and 85.3% for 2- and 4-h treatment, respectively), increased mitochondrial depolarization by 80%, and decreased intracellular GSH concentrations by 17.7%. These effects of 4-HNE were reduced by 0.25 mmol l-glutamine/L. Further study showed that the protective effect of l-glutamine was associated with the enhanced expression of genes involved in GSH production (including GCLC, GCLM, GSR, CBS, and CTH) by 3.9-14-fold, as well as genes involved in 4-HNE metabolism [e.g., glutathione S-transferase A (GSTA)1 and GSTA4] by 1.9-7.2-fold. The mRNA levels for ADH5, AKR1C1, AKR1A1, and TXNRD1 were enhanced 1.4-8.8-fold by 4-HNE but were not changed in cells co-treated with 4-HNE and l-glutamine.\n\nConclusion: These findings indicate that l-glutamine attenuates 4-HNE-induced apoptosis by regulating GSH-related redox homeostasis and enhancing GSTA-mediated metabolism in enterocytes.'"

Two enzymes of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily are notable pharmacological targets in cancer therapy (AKR1B10) and in the treatment of diabetic complications (AKR1B1).

AKR1A1,29310583,"'BACKGROUND: Chicken embryos are widely used as a model for studies of obesity; however, no detailed information is available about the dynamic changes of proteins during the regulation of adipose biology and metabolism. Thus, the present study used an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic approach to identify the changes in protein abundance at different stages of chicken embryonic development.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, the abundances of 293 hepatic proteins in 19-day old of chicken embryos compared with 14-day old and 160 hepatic proteins at hatching compared with 19-day old embryos were significantly changed. Pathway analysis showed that fatty acid degradation (upregulated ACAA2, CPT1A, and ACOX1), protein folding (upregulated PDIs, CALR3, LMAN1, and UBQLN1) and gluconeogenesis (upregulated ACSS1, AKR1A1, ALDH3A2, ALDH7A1, and FBP2) were enhanced from embryonic day 14 (E14) to E19 of chicken embryo development. Analysis of the differentially abundant proteins indicated that glycolysis was not the main way to produce energy from E19 to hatching day during chicken embryo development. In addition, purine metabolism was enhanced, as deduced from increased IMPDH2, NT5C, PGM2, and XDH abundances, and the decrease of growth rate could be overcome by increasing the abundance of ribosomal proteins from E19 to the hatching day.\n\nCONCLUSION: The levels of certain proteins were coordinated with each other to regulate the changes in metabolic pathways to satisfy the requirement for growth and development at different stages of chicken embryo development. Importantly, ACAA2, CPT1A, and ACOX1 might be key factors to control fat deposition during chicken embryonic development. These results provided information showing that chicken is a useful model to further investigate the mechanism of obesity and insulin resistance in humans.'"
AKR1A1,29117945,"'Obesity is associated with poorer outcome for many cancers. Previously, we observed that adipocytes protect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from the anthracycline, daunorubicin. In this study, it is determined whether adipocytes clear daunorubicin from the tumor microenvironment (TME). Intracellular daunorubicin concentrations were evaluated using fluorescence. Daunorubicin and its largely inactive metabolite, daunorubicinol, were analytically measured in media, cells, and tissues using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Expression of daunorubicin-metabolizing enzymes, aldo-keto reductases (AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and AKR7A2) and carbonyl reductases (CBR1, CBR3), in human adipose tissue, were queried using public databases and directly measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblot. Adipose tissue AKR activity was measured by colorimetric assay. Adipocytes absorbed and efficiently metabolized daunorubicin to daunorubicinol, reducing its antileukemia effect in the local microenvironment. Murine studies confirmed adipose tissue conversion of daunorubicin to daunorubicinol  Adipocytes expressed high levels of AKR and CBR isoenzymes that deactivate anthracyclines. Indeed, adipocyte protein levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3 are higher than all other human noncancerous cell types. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that adipocytes metabolize and inactivate a therapeutic drug. Adipocyte-mediated daunorubicin metabolism reduces active drug concentration in the TME. These results could be clinically important for adipocyte-rich cancer microenvironments such as omentum, breast, and marrow. As AKR and CBR enzymes metabolize several drugs, and can be expressed at higher levels in obese individuals, this proof-of-principle finding has important implications across many diseases. Adipocyte absorption and metabolism of chemotherapies can reduce cytotoxicity in cancer microenvironments, potentially contributing to poorer survival outcomes. .'"

The natural product (1) showed better inhibitory activity for AKR1B1 with IC value of 2.095±0.77µM compare to standard sorbinil (IC=3.14±0.02µM). Moreover, the compound (1) also showed multifolds higher activity (IC=0.783±0.07µM) against AKR1A1 as compared to standard valproic acid (IC=57.4±0.89µM). However, the natural product (2) showed slightly lower activity for AKR1B1 (IC=4.324±1.25µM).

In a pCAG-eGFP transgenic mouse line that was produced by pronuclear microinjection, the integration of the transgene resulted in a 30-kb genomic DNA deletion, including the Akr1A1 gene, and thus caused the knockout (KO) of the Akr1A1 gene and targeting of the eGFP gene. The Akr1A1 KO mice (Akr1A1eGFP/eGFP) exhibited insufficient serum ascorbic acid levels, abnormal bone development and osteoporosis. Using micro-CT analysis, the results showed that the microarchitecture of the 12-week-old Akr1A1eGFP/eGFP mouse femur was shorter in length and exhibited less cortical bone thickness, enlargement of the bone marrow cavity and a complete loss of the trabecular bone in the distal femur. The femoral head and neck of the proximal femur also showed a severe loss of bone mass. Based on the decreased levels of serum osteocalcin and osteoblast activity in the Akr1A1eGFP/eGFP mice, the osteoporosis might be caused by impaired bone formation. In addition, administration of ascorbic acid to the Akr1A1eGFP/eGFP mice significantly prevented the condition of osteoporotic femurs and increased bone formation. Therefore, through ascorbic acid administration, the Akr1A1 KO mice exhibited controllable osteoporosis and may serve as a novel model for osteoporotic research.'"

The cDNA was 1172\u2009bp long which includes an open reading frame of 975\u2009bp encoding a 324 amino acids protein and a stop codon. The sequence showed 3' and 5' non-coding regions of 179 and 18\u2009bp.

Nucleotide sequence investigation of AKR1A1 gene and 5'-flanking region showed that the structural gene and the 5'-flanking region were approximately 2975\u2009bp and 4006\u2009bp in length, respectively. The protein-coding region contained eight exons, and one additional upstream exon. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that the highest level of AKR1A1 expression was found in bile (108.7), followed by kidney (77.9), muscles (37.3), and liver (24.7). mRNA levels of AKR1A1 were almost negligible in gills (0.6) while no detectable (ND) constitutive expression was detected in gut.

AKR1A1,27595938,"'Ligands such as enzyme inhibitors stabilize the native conformation of a protein upon binding to the native state, but some compounds destabilize the native conformation upon binding to the non-native state. The former ligands are termed ""stabilizer chaperones"" and the latter ones ""destabilizer chaperones."" Because the stabilization effects are essential for the medical chaperone (MC) hypothesis, here we have formulated a thermodynamic system consisting of a ligand and a protein in its native- and non-native state. Using the differential scanning fluorimetry and the circular dichroism varying the urea concentration and temperature, we found that when the coenzyme NADP was absent, inhibitors such as isolithocholic acid stabilized the aldo-keto reductase AKR1A1 upon binding, which showed actually the three-state folding, but destabilized AKR1B10. In contrast, in the presence of NADP , they destabilized AKR1A1 and stabilized AKR1B10. To explain these phenomena, we decomposed the free energy of stabilization (ΔΔG) into its enthalpy (ΔΔH) and entropy (ΔΔS) components. Then we found that in a relatively unstable protein showing the three-state folding, native conformation was stabilized by the negative ΔΔH in association with the negative ΔΔS, suggesting that the stabilizer chaperon decreases the conformational fluctuation of the target protein or increase its hydration. However, in other cases, ΔΔG was essentially determined by the delicate balance between ΔΔH and ΔΔS. The proposed thermodynamic formalism is applicable to the system including multiple ligands with allosteric interactions. These findings would promote the development of screening strategies for MCs to regulate the target conformations.'"
AKR1A1,27491883,"'The BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), nilotinib, was developed to surmount resistance or intolerance to imatinib in patients with Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recent studies have shown that nilotinib induces potent sensitization to anticancer agents by blocking the functions of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in multidrug resistance (MDR). However, changes in P-gp expression or function affect the cardiac disposition and prolong the presence of both doxorubicin (DOX) and doxorubicinol (DOXol) in cardiac tissue, thus, enhancing the risk of cardiotoxicity. In this study, we used a MDR xenograft model to evaluate the antitumor activity, tissue distribution and cardiotoxicity of DOX when co-administered with nilotinib. This information will provide more insight into the pharmacological role of nilotinib in MDR reversal and the risk of DOX cardiotoxicity. Our results showed that nilotinib significantly enhanced DOX cytotoxicity and increased intracellular rhodamine 123 accumulation in MG63/DOX cells in vitro and strongly enhanced DOX inhibition of growth of P-gp-overexpressing MG63/DOX cell xenografts in nude mice. Additionally, nilotinib significantly increased DOX and DOXol accumulation in serum, heart, liver and tumor tissues. Importantly, nilotinib induced a disproportionate increase in DOXol in cardiac tissue. In the co-administration group, CBR1 and AKR1A1 protein levels were significantly increased in cardiac tissue, with more severe necrosis and vacuole formation. These results indicate that nilotinib reverses P-gp- mediated MDR by blocking the efflux function and potentiates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. These findings represent a guide for the design of future clinical trials and studies of pharmacokinetic interactions and may be useful in guiding the use of nilotinib in combination therapy of cancer in clinical practice.'"

Although several factors, including the metabolism of warfarin via CYP450, have been reported to affect the safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy, the wide variance in the warfarin dosage in patients has not been completely clarified. In addition to the oxidative metabolism of warfarin mediated by CYP450, reductive metabolism is involved in warfarin biotransformation. However, the reductive metabolism of warfarin has been largely unexplored and deserves further investigation. We studied warfarin reduction by human liver fractions and found a 9-fold higher velocity of warfarin reduction in the cytosol than in microsomes (Vmax=77.2 vs. 8.7pmol/mgprotein/min, respectively). Furthermore, of nine recombinant cytosolic carbonyl reducing enzymes tested for their ability to reduce warfarin, AKR1C3 and CBR1 were identified as warfarin reductases and their kinetic parameters were determined. The internal clearance of warfarin was 3 orders of magnitude higher with AKR1C3 than with CBR1 (CLint=65.922 vs. 0.070μl/mgprotein/min, respectively). This is the first time that warfarin reducing enzymes in human liver subcellular fraction have been identified. Moreover, we have described the chiral aspects of warfarin reduction using an HPLC method that enabled the detection of individual warfarin alcohol stereoisomers. Cytosol and AKR1C3 exhibit the stereoselective metabolism of (R)-warfarin to preferentially form (SR)-warfarin alcohol as the primary in vivo metabolite of warfarin.

Eighty neonatal rats (7 days after birth) were divided into four groups: normal saline group, ketamine group, and low- and high-dose propofol combined with ketamine groups. Six hours after anaesthesia, we obtained hippocampal tissue, and quantified apoptotic index and total protein concentration, and assessed global proteomics changes induced by two tested drugs. The latter changes were documented by two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. To evaluate cognitive functions, water maze test was applied after animals grew for 21 days. We further repeated proteomics studies at 21 days post-anaesthesia.\n\nRESULTS: Ketamine markedly up-regulated apoptotic index and decreased total protein concentration. Propofol dose-dependently reverted these adverse changes. Six hours post-anaesthesia, combined propofol and ketamine administration up-regulated the following proteins in the hippocampus: PD1A3, NDUFB10, HSPA8, ATP5JD, and PSMA1. Furthermore, the following proteins were down-regulated: PPIA, PKM2, GFAP, NSE, PPIA, PKM2, and GFAP. After 21 days, animals treated with ketamine showed marked disturbances in cognitive function as demonstrated by increased time of the water maze test, whereas propofol diminished these changes. In addition, expression of proteins largely normalized in propofol-treated animals, with only two up-regulated proteins (FUBP3 and PRDX5) and three down-regulated proteins (GAPDH, AKR1A1, and VCP).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects of ketamine on cognitive function are reverted by propofol, also through beneficial effects on protein expression in the hippocampus.'"
AKR1A1,26487510,"'Aldose reductase (AKR1B1) is a critical drug target because of its involvement in diabetic complications, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. However, to date, development of clinically useful inhibitors has been largely unsuccessful. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPGs) are reactive lipid mediators that bind covalently to proteins and exert anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in numerous settings. By pursuing targets for modification by cyPGs we have found that the cyPG PGA1 binds to and inactivates AKR1B1. A PGA1-AKR1B1 adduct was observed, both by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and by SDS-PAGE using biotinylated PGA1 (PGA1-B). Insight into the molecular interactions between AKR1B1 and PGA1 was advanced by molecular modeling. This anticipated the addition of PGA1 to active site Cys298 and the potential reversibility of the adduct, which was supported experimentally. Indeed, loss of biotin label from the AKR1B1-PGA1-B adduct was favored by glutathione, indicating a retro-Michael reaction, which unveils new implications of cyPG-protein interaction. PGA1 elicited only marginal inhibition of aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), considered responsible for the severe adverse effects of many AKR1B1 inhibitors. Interestingly, other prostaglandins (PGs) inhibited the enzyme, including non-electrophilic PGE1 and PGE2, currently used in clinical practice. Moreover, both PGA1 and PGE1 reduced the formation of sorbitol in an ex-vivo model of diabetic cataract to an extent comparable to that attained by the known AKR inhibitor epalrestat.

Three different fusion-detecting tools (deFuse, Chimerascan, and TopHatFusion) were used, and the results were compared. These tools detected 3,831, 6,630 and 516 fusion transcripts (FTs) overall. We primarily focused on the results obtained using the deFuse software. More FTs were identified from HER2 subtype breast cancer samples than from the luminal or triple-negative subtypes (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Seventy fusion candidates were selected for validation, and 32 (45.7%) were confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Of the validated fusions, six were recurrent (found in 2 or more samples), three were in-frame (PRDX1-AKR1A1, TACSTD2-OMA1, and C2CD2-TFF1) and three were off-frame (CEACAM7-CEACAM6, CYP4X1-CYP4Z2P, and EEF1DP3-FRY). Notably, the novel read-through fusion, EEF1DP3-FRY, was identified and validated in 6.7% (8/120) of the breast cancer samples.

Although the efficacies of these drugs in combination treatments have been demonstrated in clinical practice, their possible interference with DOX metabolism has not been described in detail to date. In the present study, we investigated the possible interactions of human carbonyl reducing enzymes with 5-FU, PTX, DTX, CYC and TMX. First, the reducing activities of carbonyl reducing enzymes toward DOX were tested using incubations with purified recombinant enzymes. In the subsequent studies, we investigated the possible effects of the tested anticancer agents on the DOX-reducing activities of the most potent enzymes (AKR1C3, CBR1 and AKR1A1) and on the DOX metabolism driven by MCF7, HepG2 and human liver cytosols. In both of these assays, we observed that CYC and its active metabolites inhibited DOX metabolism. In the final study, we tracked the changes in AKR1C3, CBR1 and AKR1A1 expression levels following exposure to the tested cytostatics in MCF7 and HepG2 cells. Consequently, no significant changes in the expression levels of tested enzymes were detected in either cell line. Based on these findings, it is feasible to presume that inhibition rather than induction plays a role in the interactions of the tested anticancer agents with DOX-reducing enzymes.

Eleven candidate genes were then evaluated in an independent series of 50 pretreatment patients. Protein expression of the most significant genes was confirmed by immunoblotting. AKR1A1 was significantly overexpressed and AKR1C1-4, KCNAB1, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 downregulated in tumors compared with control nonneoplastic tissues after correction for multiple testing. Significant association of CYP2B6 transcript levels in tumors with expression of hormonal receptors was found in the posttreatment set and replicated in the pretreatment set of patients. Significantly higher intratumoral levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, or CYP2W1 were found in responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with nonresponders. Patients with high AKR7A3 or CYP2B6 levels in the pretreatment set had significantly longer disease-free survival than patients with low levels. Protein products of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR7A3, CYP3A4, and carbonyl reductase (CBR1) were found in tumors and those of AKR1C1, AKR7A3, and CBR1 correlated with their transcript levels. Small interfering RNA-directed knockdown of AKR1C2 or vector-mediated upregulation of CYP3A4 in MDA-MB-231 model cell line had no effect on cell proliferation after paclitaxel treatment in vitro. Prognostic and predictive roles of drug-metabolizing enzymes strikingly differ between posttreatment and pretreatment breast carcinoma patients.

Thus, Adh6-regulated, SNO-CoA-mediated protein S-nitrosylation provides a regulatory mechanism paralleling protein acetylation. We also find that SNO-CoA reductases are present from bacteria to mammals, and we identify aldo-keto reductase 1A1 as the mammalian functional analog of Adh6.

AKR1A1,25279998,"""Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are promiscuous NAD(P)(H) dependent oxidoreductases implicated in the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols to the corresponding o-quinones with the concomitant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The PAH o-quinones are Michael acceptors and can form adducts but are also redox-active and enter into futile redox cycles to amplify ROS formation. Evidence exists to support this metabolic pathway in humans. The human recombinant AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C4 enzymes all catalyze the oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols to PAH o-quinones. Many human AKRs also catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of the o-quinone products to air-sensitive catechols, exacerbating ROS formation. Moreover, this pathway of PAH activation occurs in a panel of human lung cell lines, resulting in the production of ROS and oxidative DNA damage in the form of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine. Using stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, this pathway of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) metabolism was found to contribute equally with the diol-epoxide pathway to the activation of this human carcinogen in human lung cells. Evaluation of the mutagenicity of anti-B[a]P-diol epoxide with B[a]P-7,8-dione on p53 showed that the o-quinone produced by AKRs was the more potent mutagen, provided that it was permitted to redox cycle, and that the mutations observed were G to T transversions, reminiscent of those observed in human lung cancer. It is concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support the role of human AKRs in the metabolic activation of PAH in human lung cell lines and that they may contribute to the causation of human lung cancer."""
AKR1A1,25256836,"'Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a recreational and date-rape drug, for which the detection following ingestion is hampered by rapid metabolism and its endogenous presence. GHB catabolism occurs mainly by its oxidation to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), which converts to succinate and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. A high Km aldehyde reductase has previously been reported to catalyse the NADP-dependent oxidation of GHB at high concentrations. It is assumed that this enzyme is identical to the aldo-keto reductase AKR1A1, but its role in GHB oxidation has not been fully evaluated. In this study, the extent of AKR1A1 in GHB metabolism has been determined in HepG2 cells using RNA-interference technology. The gene encoding AKR1A1 was targeted by siRNA. Results demonstrate a successful knock-down of the AKR1A1 gene with 92% reduction in total mRNA and 93% reduction in protein expression. Demolishing AKR1A1 expression in HepG2 cells leads to significant 82% decrease in NADP-dependent GHB-dehydrogenase activity at high concentration (10mM) of GHB. Moreover, when exposing the cells to 50 μM of GHB for 24h, and measuring intracellular and extracellular GHB levels by GC/MS, a significant two-fold increase was observed on GHB intracellular level in silenced cells. In contrast, measuring SSA-reductase activity in silenced cells indicated that AKR1A1 is not involved in endogenous GHB production. These findings describe a pathway for GHB metabolism in the liver which should be useful in GHB exposure cases, and will enable a better understanding of the enzymes participating in its metabolism at natural and overexposed levels.'"

Cancer patients with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. We profiled the expression of anthracycline metabolizing enzymes in hearts from donors with- and without- DS.\n\nMETHODS: Cardiac expression of CBR1, CBR3, AKR1A1, AKR1C3 and AKR7A2 was examined by quantitative real time PCR, quantitative immunoblotting, and enzyme activity assays using daunorubicin. The CBR1 polymorphism rs9024 was investigated by allelic discrimination with fluorescent probes. The contribution of CBRs/AKRs proteins to daunorubicin reductase activity was examined by multiple linear regression.\n\nRESULTS: CBR1 was the most abundant transcript (average relative expression; DS: 81%, non-DS: 58%), and AKR7A2 was the most abundant protein (average relative expression; DS: 38%, non-DS: 35%). Positive associations between cardiac CBR1 protein levels and daunorubicin reductase activity were found for samples from donors with- and without- DS. Regression analysis suggests that sex, CBR1, AKR1A1, and AKR7A2 protein levels were significant contributors to cardiac daunorubicin reductase activity.

Herein, we propose a quantitative method to measure human AKR proteins in cells using mTRAQ-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). AKR peptides with multiple transitions were carefully selected upon tryptic digestion of the recombinant AKR proteins, while AKR proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE fractionation coupled with LC-MS/MS. Utilizing mTRAQ triplex labeling to produce the derivative peptides, calibration curves were generated using the mixed lysate as background, and no significantly different quantification of AKRs was elicited from the two sets of calibration curves under the mixed and single lysate as background. We employed this approach to quantitatively determine the 6 AKR proteins, AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1/C2, AKR1C3, and AKR1C4, in 7 different cancer cell lines and for the first time to obtain the absolute quantities of all the AKR proteins in each cell. The cluster plot revealed that AKR1A and AKR1B were widely distributed in most cancer cells with relatively stable abundances, whereas AKR1Cs were unevenly detected among these cells with diverse dynamic abundances. The AKR quantitative distribution in different cancer cells, therefore, may assist further exploration toward how the AKR proteins are involved in tumorigenesis.'"
AKR1A1,23305850,"'Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.'"
AKR1A1,23295227,"'Only one crystal structure is currently available for tumor marker AKR1B10, complexed with NADP(+) and tolrestat, which is an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) of the carboxylic acid type. Here, the X-ray structure of the complex of the V301L substituted AKR1B10 holoenzyme with fidarestat, an ARI of the cyclic imide type, was obtained at 1.60Å resolution by replacement soaking of crystals containing tolrestat. Previously, fidarestat was found to be safe in phase III trials for diabetic neuropathy and, consistent with its low in vivo side effects, was highly selective for aldose reductase (AR or AKR1B1) versus aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Now, inhibition studies showed that fidarestat was indeed 1300-fold more selective for AR as compared to AKR1B10, while the change of Val to Leu (found in AR) caused a 20-fold decrease in the IC50 value with fidarestat. Structural analysis of the V301L AKR1B10-fidarestat complex displayed enzyme-inhibitor interactions similar to those of the AR-fidarestat complex. However, a close inspection of both the new crystal structure and a computer model of the wild-type AKR1B10 complex with fidarestat revealed subtle changes that could affect fidarestat binding. In the crystal structure, a significant motion of loop A was observed between AR and V301L AKR1B10, linked to a Phe-122/Phe-123 side chain displacement. This was due to the presence of the more voluminous Gln-303 side chain (Ser-302 in AR) and of a water molecule buried in a subpocket located at the base of flexible loop A. In the wild-type AKR1B10 model, a short contact was predicted between the Val-301 side chain and fidarestat, but would not be present in AR or in V301L AKR1B10. Overall, these changes could contribute to the difference in inhibitory potency of fidarestat between AR and AKR1B10.'"

Human AKR enzymes are highly polymorphic, and allelic variants may contribute to different AKRs expression in individuals. Despite the importance of AKRs in PAHs metabolism, there are no studies that evaluate, in general human populations, the effect of PAHs on AKRs expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs).

AKR1A1,22555805,"'The main obstacle to cure tumors by radiotherapy has been ascribed to tumor radioresistance. To determine the mechanisms underlying resistance to irradiation, it is essential to compare proteins differentially expressed from radiotherapy-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells. Aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) was recently identified as increased in radioresistant laryngeal cancer cells by comparative proteomics approach. Here, we provide the mechanism of AKR1A1-mediated radioresistance via p53 regulation in laryngeal cancer cells. AKR1A1 induction was correlated with the radioresistant phenotype of laryngeal cancer HEp-2 cells. AKR1A1 depletion with siRNA significantly enhanced radiation sensitivity of radioresistant HEp-2 cells by promoting radiation-induced cell death and accelerated radiation-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, without affecting either the PI3K-Akt or MAPK-ERK pathways. Intriguingly, AKR1A1 depletion induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and G 2/M transition in response to irradiation. We further found that AKR1A1 interacted with p53 and this interaction was dramatically increased in the irradiated radioresistant cells compared with the control cells. AKR1A1 expression also regulated p53 stability in response to irradiation. Furthermore, AKR1A1 depletion only sensitized HCT116 cells expressing p53 to irradiation and not p53-deficient cells. Therefore, our data suggest that radiation-inducible AKR1A1 contributes to acquired radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells by suppressing p53 activation through inhibitory interaction.'"

A partial AKR1A1 cDNA was identified, sequenced and compared with AKR1A1 reported sequences in the GenBank DNA database. Constitutive AKR1A1 mRNA expression was detected mainly in liver, similarly to that of CYP1A. BaP exposure resulted in statistically significant AKR1A1 and CYP1A mRNA induction in liver (20- and 120-fold, respectively) at 24 h. On the other hand, ethoxyquin (EQ) was used as control inducer for AKR1A1 mRNA. Interestingly, EQ also induced CYP1A mRNA levels in tilapia liver.

In total, 108 DEPs were found by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and 40 DEPs were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight and liquid chromatography-MS. DEPs were classified into five clusters (Clusters 1-5), according to their expression trends using Cluster 3.0 software, involved in regulating biological processes such as the stress response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, energy metabolism, transport, and the actin cytoskeleton. The expression patterns of ten DEPs, distributed across five clusters, including AKR1A1, AGAT, ATP6V1B2, HIBADH, MDH1, MPST, NIT2, PRDX6, PSMB7, and TPI1, were validated by Western blotting. Based on Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we also found that the DEP FHL2, which was primarily expressed in the mesangial region, was down-regulated on days 3 and 5, and up-regulated on day 10. In vitro, we found that FHL2 overexpression induced mesangial cell proliferation by increasing the number of S-phase cells and decreasing G2/M-phase cells, whereas inhibiting FHL2 had the opposite effect.

Alternatively, PAHs are metabolized to (±)-anti-diol epoxides, such as (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide ((±)-anti-BPDE)), by the combined action of P4501A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase.

DNR and DOL concentrations were determined by HPLC.\n\nRESULTS: We found a large interindividual variation (up to 47-fold) in leukemic cell DNR metabolism. The specific CR1 inhibitor zeraleone analogue 5 significantly inhibited DNR metabolism with a mean inhibitory effect of 68 %. No correlation between mRNA levels of the enzymes and metabolism were found. Cellular DNR metabolism correlated significantly with CR1 protein expression, determined by western blot, (p < 0.05, R2 = 0,229) while no significant correlation was found with AKR1A1 protein expression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: DNR metabolism in AML cells shows a pronounced interindividual variability.

AKR1A1,20097305,"'Tumor suppressor SMAR1 is known to be involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptotic genes transcription. It also directly interacts and stabilizes p53 through phosphorylation at serine-15 residue. Although the functions of SMAR1 are mainly restricted to the nucleus, we report its novel function with the cytoplasm. We show that SMAR1 directly interacts and inhibits AKR1a4 enzyme activity. Interestingly, AKR1a4 enzyme activity is elevated in higher grades of breast cancer where SMAR1 expression is drastically downregulated. Higher AKR1a4 activity protects the cancer cells from anticancer drugs and free radical stress. Through increased metabolism, ARK1a4 helps fulfilling higher energy needs required by cancer cell. The present study delineates yet another facet of tumor suppressor activity of SMAR1 in the cytoplasm. We also depict that upon stress, ATM kinase leads to dissociation of SMAR1-AKR1a4 complex through nuclear translocation of SMAR1 causing elevated AKR1a4 activity. Nuclear SMAR1 causes cell cycle arrest giving ample time for DNA damage repair, while AKR1a4 scavenges the excess free radicals which may further cause DNA damage. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism of regulation of oxidative stress by ATM through modulation of SMAR1-AKR1a4 complex. Further, we show that a small peptide derived from SMAR1 induces free radical stress by inhibiting AKR1a4 enzyme activity, which can be a potential anticancer therapeutic agent.'"

AKR1A1,19497421,"'In contrast to hepatocytes, there is only limited information about the expression and activities of enzymes participating in metabolic activation of environmental mutagens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in liver progenitor cells. In rat liver ""stem-like"" WB-F344 cell line, sharing many characteristics with rat liver progenitor cells, PAHs are efficiently activated to their ultimate genotoxic metabolites forming DNA adducts. The present study aimed to characterize expression/activities of enzymes of two major pathways involved in the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP): cytochrome P450 (CYP) family 1 enzymes and cytosolic aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). We report here that, apart from induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression and the corresponding enzymatic activity, both BaP and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induced rat 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C9) expression and activity. In contrast, the aldehyde reductase AKR1A1 was not induced by either treatment. Thus, both CYP1 and AKR metabolic pathways were inducible in the model of liver progenitor cells. BaP and TCDD were efficient inducers of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression and activity in WB-F344 cells, a principal enzyme of cellular antioxidant defense. Both compounds also induced expression of transcription factor NRF2, involved in control of enzymes protecting cells from oxidative stress. However, although BaP induced a significant formation of reactive oxygen species, it did not induce expression of heme oxygenase-1, suggesting that induction of oxidative stress by BaP was limited. Using shRNA against the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), we found that similar to CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, the AKR1C9 induction was AhR-dependent. Moreover, constitutive AKR1C9 levels in AhR-deficient rat BP8 hepatoma cells were significantly lower than in their AhR-positive 5L variant, thus supporting possible role of AhR in regulation of AKR1C9 expression. Taken together, both CYP1 and AKR1C9 appear to be AhR-regulated metabolic pathways, which may contribute to formation of pro-carcinogenic PAH metabolites in liver progenitor cells.'"
AKR1A1,19480738,"'PURPOSE: Increased flux of glucose via the polyol pathway, oxidative stress and ischaemia lead to the upregulation of the aldose reductase (AR), the key enzyme of the polyol pathway. This adversely affects the organism and can in part be reduced by inhibition of the enzyme.\n\nMETHODS: In this study, we examined the effect of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on the expression of aldose reductase (AR, AKR1B1), aldehyde reductase (AldR, AKR1A1) and small intestine reductase (SIR, AKR1B10) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) by RT-PCR.\n\nRESULTS: In HUVEC, atorvastatin reduces the expression of aldehyde reductase and aldose reductase compared with control medium (-20% and -12% respectively, P < 0.05), while small intestine reductase is not expressed. In PTEC no regulation of aldehyde reductase and aldose reductase by atorvastatin could be measured, while the expression of small intestine reductase was reduced by 37% compared with control medium (P < 0.05). The reduction observed was not abolished by the addition of mevalonic acid.\n\nCONCLUSION: The reduction of members of the aldo-keto-reductase family by atorvastatin is a novel way to influence the polyol pathway and a new pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin.'"

After comparing the results, 11 genes were significantly increased by the mechanical asphyxia treatment in the mouse lung. Of those genes, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1), TGF-beta stimulated gene 22, domain family protein 3 (TSC22d3) and Luc7 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-like (Luc7l) after asphyxia were more significantly increased than those after decapitation. Dusp1 inactivated mitogen activated protein kinase, which functions in cell proliferation. However, the consumption of oxygen had a disadvantageous effect on survival, because tissue or cells were not able to produce energy by internal respiration under the suddenly hypoxic condition following asphyxia. The increased transcripts of Dusp1 following asphyxia suppressed oxygen consumption. TSC22d3 was isolated as a TGF-beta-inducible gene and it is also identified as a glucocorticoid (GC)-induced leucine zipper (GILZ). GC was released from the adrenal gland via HPA axis under the hypoxic condition. Especially in acute suffocation, GC rapidly increased. Therefore, the increase in TSC22d3 may be induced by the increased GC following asphyxia. We were unable to clarify the Luc7l increase, because there are no reports in relation to asphyxia. In addition, GILZ mediates the antiproliferative activity of glucocorticoids. We thought that the increasing TSC22d3 may lead to the suppression of oxygen consumption to avoid wasting energy, as in proliferation, the same as the increase in Dusp1. Our data indicated that the determination of the protein product level in the lung could help in diagnosing asphyxia. In addition, these data may contribute to revealing the patho-physiology of asphyxia and to help diagnose asphyxia, including hanging.'"

Overall, 39 of 58 evaluated CMEs were found to be expressed at the transcript level. Together the transformed cell lines showed altered transcription of eight CME genes compared to NBK, substantiating earlier results. Serum increased transcript levels of ALDH1A3, DHRS3, HPGD and AKR1A1, and decreased those of ALDH4A1 in NBK; of these, the transformed, TSD-deficient cell lines partly retained regulation of ALDH1A3 and DHRS3. Activity measurements in crude cell lysates, including relevant enzymatic inhibitors, indicated significant capacity for CME-mediated xenobiotic metabolism among the cell lines, notably with an increase in serum-differentiated NBK.

Recent reports on close relationships between ARK1C3 and various cancers including breast and prostate cancers implicate the involvement of AKR1C3 in cancer development or progression. We previously described the characterization of an isoform-specific monoclonal antibody against AKR1C3 that does not cross-react with related, >86% sequence identity, human AKR1C1, AKR1C2, or AKR1C4, human aldehyde reductase AKR1A1, or rat 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C9). In this study, a clone of murine monoclonal antibody raised against AKR1C3 was identified and characterized for its recognition of rat homolog. Tissue distribution of human AKR1C3 and its rat homolog in adult genitourinary systems including kidney, bladder, prostate, and testis was studied by IHC. A strong immunoreactivity was detected not only in classically hormone-associated tissues such as prostate and testis but also in non-hormone-associated tissues such as kidney and bladder in humans and rats.

Reconstituted in vitro systems were used to compare the steady-state kinetic constants for human P450 (P450 1A1 and 1B1) and AKR (AKR1A1, AKR1C1-1C4) mediated metabolism of (+/-)- trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[ a]pyrene ((+/-)-B[ a]P-7,8-diol) at physiological pH. It was found that P450 isoforms yielded much greater k cat/ K m values than AKR enzymes. Initial rates of (+/-)-B[ a]P-7,8-diol oxidation were measured for AKR1A1, AKR1C2, P450 1A1, and P450 1B1 as the ratio of NADPH/NAD (+) cofactors was varied to determine the redox state necessary for AKRs to successfully compete for trans-dihydrodiols. P450 and AKR enzymes equally competed for (+/-)-B[ a]P-7,8-diol substrate at an NADPH/NAD (+) ratio equal to 0.001. The resting NADPH/NAD (+) ratio was determined in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells to be 0.28. These data suggest that the P450 pathway would be favored over the AKR pathway if the enzymes were equally expressed. Basal mRNA transcript levels of AKR1C1-1C3 exceed those of both basal and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced P450 1A1 and 1B1 by up to 90-fold in A549 cells as measured by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. AKR expression levels were comparable to TCDD-induced P450 1A1 and 1B1 in HBEC-KT immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Functional assays of both A549 and HBEC-KT cell lysates demonstrated a lack of TCDD-inducible P450 1A1/1B1 activity but robust basal expression of AKR1A1 and AKR1C activities, where the functional assay for P450 detection is 300-fold more sensitive than the functional assay for AKR isoforms.

The alcohol metabolites of DAUN and DOX, daunorubicinol (DAUNol) and doxorubicinol (DOXol), respectively, are generated through reduction of the C-13 carbonyl function, which is reportedly mediated by members of the aldo-keto reductase and carbonyl reductase families of proteins. In our search for potential biomarkers for the occurrence of this side effect, we examined the activity of recombinant aldo-keto reductase enzymes, aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1A1 and AKR1C2, with DAUN and DOX as substrates. Using purified histidine-tagged recombinant proteins and the direct measurement of metabolite formation with a high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence assay, we did not observe DAUNol or DOXol generation in vitro by AKR1C2, whereas AKR1A1 did catalyze the reduction reactions. DAUNol was generated by AKR1A1 at a rate of 1.71 +/- 0.09 nmol/min/mg protein, and a low level of DOXol was produced by AKR1A1; however, it was below the limits of quantification for the method.

AKR1A1,18276838,"'Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are a class of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that have been linked to metabolism of the anthracyclines doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAUN). Although widely used, cardiotoxicity continues to be a serious side effect that may be linked to metabolites or reactive intermediates generated in their metabolism. In this study we examine the little known effects of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms of human AKR1A1 on the metabolism of these drugs to their alcohol metabolites. Expressed and purified from bacteria using affinity chromatography, the AKR1A1 protein with a single histidine (6x-His) tag exhibited the greatest activity using two test substrates: p-nitrobenzaldehyde (5.09 +/- 0.16 micromol/min/mg of purified protein) and DL-glyceraldehyde (1.24 +/- 0.17 micromol/min/mg). These activities are in agreement with published literature values of nontagged human AKR1A1. The 6x-His-tagged AKR1A1 wild type and allelic variants, E55D and N52S, were subsequently examined for metabolic activity using DAUN and DOX. The tagged variants showed significantly reduced activities (1.10 +/- 0.42 and 0.72 +/- 0.47 nmol of daunorubicinol (DAUNol) formed/min/mg of purified protein for E55D and N52S, respectively) compared with the wild type (2.34 +/- 0.71 nmol/min/mg). The wild type and E55D variant metabolized DOX to doxorubicinol (DOXol); however, the levels fell below the limit of quantitation (25 nM). The N52S variant yielded no detectable DOXol. A kinetic analysis of the DAUN reductase activities revealed that both amino acid substitutions lead to reduced substrate affinity, measured as significant increases in the measured K(m) for the reduction reaction by AKR1A1. Hence, it is possible that these allelic variants can act as genetic biomarkers for the clinical development of DAUN-induced cardiotoxicity.'"

Whereas most research projects in this field rely on phosphorylation-dependent tau-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the phosphorylation patterns recognized by these mAbs are often not characterized in detail. Therefore, we synthesized unphosphorylated, two monophosphorylated (pThr231, pSer235), and the bisphosphorylated (pThr231+pSer235) tau226-240 peptides. The phosphopeptides were ligated via an N-terminal cysteine to the thioester-activated C-terminus of human aldo/keto reductase AKR1A1. After purification by preparative gel electrophoresis, the ligation products were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau mAbs HPT-101, HPT-103, HPT-104, and HPT-110.

Adsorption of wild-type AKR1A1 to streptavidin templates and of biotinylated AKR1A1 to uncoated templates was used to study randomly immobilised enzymes. Investigation of the kinetic parameters revealed remarkably improved activity for the site-specifically immobilised enzyme, which was comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme in solution and 60-300-fold greater than that of the randomly immobilized enzymes.

Elevated levels of carbonyl-reducing enzymes in cancer cells may therefore contribute to the development of DRC chemoresistance and affect the clinical outcome. In the present investigation, human pancreas carcinoma cells were transfected with three important DRC reductases, namely carbonyl reductase (CBR1), aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) and aldose reductase (AKR1B1), and levels of resistance towards DCR determined. Overexpression of all three reductases lead to a higher DRC inactivation and to an elevation of chemoresistance (7-fold for CBR1, 4.5-fold for AKR1A1 and 3.7-fold for AKR1B1), when IC(50)-values were considered.

In AKR1A1-transfected H358 cells, (+)-anti-trans-B[a]PDE-N2-dGuo was also the major adduct with a 3 h lag phase before significant adduct formation was detected. In AKR1A1-transfected H358 cells with induced P450 1A1/P450 1B1, (+)-anti-trans-B[a]PDE-N2-dGuo was formed with no lag phase in amounts similar to those in the H358 cells with up-regulated P450 1A1/P450 1B1.

The proximate carcinogens PAH-diols can be converted to o-quinones by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) or to diol-epoxides by cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. We assessed the effect of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol (BPD) on proliferation in p53-null bronchoalveolar carcinoma H358 cells. BPD treatment led to a significant inhibition of proliferation and arrest in G2/M in H358 cells. The relative contribution of the AKR and P450 pathways to cell cycle arrest was assessed. Overexpression of AKR1A1 did not affect cell proliferation or cell cycle progression, and benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione did not cause any noticeable effect on cell growth, suggesting that AKR1A1 metabolic products were not involved in the antiproliferative effect of BPD. On the other hand, blockade of P450 induction or inhibition of P450 activity greatly impaired the effect of BPD. Moreover, P450 induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effect of BPD. Mechanistic studies revealed that BPD caused a DNA damage response, Chk1 activation, and accumulation of phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15) in H358 cells, effects that were impaired by an ataxia-telangectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM-related (ATR) inhibitor. Similar results were observed in human bronchoepithelial BEAS-2B cells, arguing for analogous mechanisms in tumorigenic and immortalized nontumorigenic cells lacking functional p53.

To determine the effect of this mutation on oxidative stress marker genes, we performed oligonucleotide array analysis (Affymetrix), and compared the results in Atp7b m/m rats with those of a sibling line with the Atp7b w/w genotype. We focused our studies on the expression of the aldo-keto reductase 1 family B7 (AKR1B7)-like protein gene, since this gene codes for reductase enzymes involved in the detoxification of oxidizing compounds (e.g., aldehydes) and was differentially expressed in Atp7b m/m and Atp7b w/w rat liver. Akr1B7 mRNA expression was significantly increased in comparison with the expression of 4 other known oxidative stress responsive genes, haem-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), thioredoxin (Trx), aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). By searching binding motifs, five nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding sites were located in the 5'-upstream region of the akr1b7 gene. Transient co-transfection with both I-kappaBalpha and the Akr1b7 6 kb promoter (p6.0-AKR-Luc) inhibited luciferase activity of p6.0-AKR-Luc in HepG2 cells.

Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 oxidative stress genes (AKR1A1, AKR1C1, CYBA, GPX, MPO, NOS2A, NOS3, OGG1, PPARG and SOD2) were genotyped in 1172 NHL cases and 982 population-based controls from a USA multicenter case-control study. For NHL and five subtypes (diffuse large B-cell, follicular, marginal zone, small lymphocytic and T-cell), SNP associations were calculated. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for sex, age (<45, 45-64, 65+ years), race (white, black, other) and study site. Overall, the oxidative stress pathway was associated significantly with the B-cell NHL subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (global P-value=0.003). Specifically, for nitric oxide synthase (NOS2A Ser608Leu, rs2297518) Leu/Leu homozygotes, there was a 2-fold risk increase for NHL (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.1-4.4) (referent=Ser/Ser and Ser/Leu). This risk increase was consistent by cell lineage (B- and T-cell NHL) and pronounced for the two most common subtypes, diffuse large B-cell (OR=3.4, 95% CI=1.5-7.8) and follicular lymphoma (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.0-6.8).

Genetic variations that result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species appear to increase risk for NHL and its major subtypes, particularly DLBCL. Independent replication of our findings are warranted and further evaluation of oxidative stress in the context of inflammation, DNA repair and the induction of the NF-kappaB pathway may further reveal important clues for lymphomagenesis.'"

Metabolite formation was confirmed by HPLC/MS and quantitatively measured by HPLC/UV/beta-RAM. In TCDD-treated H358 cells (P4501B1 expression), the anti-BPDE hydrolysis product BP-tetrol-1 increased over 3-12 h to a constant level. In H358 AKR1A1 transfectants, formation of BP-7,8-dione was elevated for 3-12 h but significantly decreased after 24 h. Interestingly, BP-tetrols were also detected in AKR1A1 transfectants even though they do not constitutively express P4501A1/P4501B1 enzymes. Northern and Western blotting confirmed the induction of P4501B1 by BP-7,8-dione in parental cells and the induction of P4501B1 by BP-7,8-diol in AKR1A1-transfected cells. P4501B1 induction was blocked in AKR1A1 transfectants by the AKR1A1 inhibitor (sulfonylnitromethane), the o-quinone scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine), or the cytosolic AhR antagonist (diflubenzuron). Attenuation of P4501B1 induction in these cells was verified by measuring a decrease in BP-tetrol formation. Our studies show that the formation of BP-7,8-dione by AKR1A1 in human bronchoalveolar cells leads to an induction of P4501B1 and that a functional consequence of this induction is elevated anti-BPDE production as detected by increased BP-tetrol formation. Therefore, the role of AKR1A1 in the activation of BP-7,8-diol is bifunctional; that is, it directly activates BP-7,8-diol to the reactive and redox-active PAH o-quinone (BP-7,8-dione) and it indirectly trans-activates the P4501B1 gene by generating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand BP-7,8-dione.'"

The inhibition was uncompetitive for both inhibitors and irreversible in the case of flufenamic acid.'"
AKR1A1,16289176,"'The reductive metabolism of trans, trans-muconaldehyde, a cytotoxic metabolite of benzene, was studied in mouse liver. Using an HPLC-based stopped assay, the primary reduced metabolite was identified as 6-hydroxy-trans, trans-2,4-hexadienal (OH/CHO) and the secondary metabolite as 1,6-dihydroxy-trans, trans-2,4-hexadiene (OH/OH). The main enzymes responsible for the highest levels of reductase activity towards trans, trans-muconaldehyde were purified from mouse liver soluble fraction first by Q-sepharose chromatography followed by either blue or red dye affinity chromatography. In mouse liver, trans, trans-muconaldehyde is predominantly reduced by an NADH-dependent enzyme, which was identified as alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1). Kinetic constants obtained for trans, trans-muconaldehyde with the native Adh1 enzyme showed a Vmax of 2141+/-500 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 11+/-4 microM. This enzyme was inhibited by pyrazole with a KI of 3.1+/-0.57 microM. Other fractions were found to contain muconaldehyde reductase activity independent of Adh1, and one enzyme was identified as the NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase AKR1A4. This showed a Vmax of 115 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 15+/-2 microM and was not inhibited by pyrazole.'"
AKR1A1,15720144,"'(+/-)-7,8-Dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BP-7,8-diol), a proximate carcinogen derived from benzo[a]pyrene (BP) requires further metabolic activation to exert its carcinogenic effects. Two principal pathways have been implicated, and these involve either the formation of (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-9alpha,10alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-BPDE) catalyzed by P450 1A1/P450 1B1 (NADPH-dependent monoxygenases) or the formation of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione (BP-7,8-dione) catalyzed by human aldo-keto reductases AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C4 [NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases]. The relative contributions of the two pathways to PAH activation are unknown. In this study, BP-7,8-diol metabolism was studied in human bronchoalveolar H358 cell extracts. Parental H358 cells do not constitutively express P450 1A1/P450 1B1 or AKRs but were manipulated by induction with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) to express P450 1A1/P450 1B1 or by stable transfection to express AKR1A1 (aldehyde reductase). TCDD induction of AKR1A1 transfectants provided a cell line that expressed both pathways. Extracts derived from parental H358 cells plus TCDD (P450 induction) produced electrophilic anti-BPDE, which hydrolyzed to benzo[a]pyrene tetrahydrotetrols (BP-tetrols), extracts derived from AKR1A1-transfected cells (AKR1A1 expression) produced reactive and redox-active BP-7,8-dione, which was trapped in situ as its mono(thioether) conjugate, and extracts derived from AKR1A1 transfectants plus TCDD (coexpression of P450 1A1/P450 1B1 and AKR1A1) produced both anti-BPDE and BP-7,8-dione. The competing activation of BP-7,8-diol by P450 1A1/P450 1B1 and AKR1A1 was studied with varied NADPH:NAD+ ratios. The system with a relatively higher concentration of NADPH favored formation of anti-BPDE via P450 1A1/P450 1B1, while the system with the higher concentration of NAD+ favored formation of BP-7,8-dione via AKR1A1. Under conditions that mimic the cellular redox state, 10 microM NADPH and 1 mM NAD+, equal amounts of BP-tetrols and BP-7,8-dione were formed. This suggests that P450 1A1/P450 1B1 and AKR1A1 play competing roles in the metabolic activation of BP-7,8-diol and that the dominant pathway of BP-7,8-diol activation depends on the redox state of the cells. These model systems provide a cellular context in which the dominant DNA adducts/lesions formed by either pathway may be compared.'"
AKR1A1,15582534,"'Human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3 (type 2 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/type 5 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) catalyzes the reduction of Delta(4)-androstene-3,17-dione to yield testosterone, the reduction of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone to yield 3alpha- and 3beta-androstanediol, and the reduction of estrone to yield 17beta-estradiol. Relatively, high mRNA expression of AKR1C3 was found in human prostate and mammary gland where it is implicated in regulating ligand access to the androgen and estrogen receptor, respectively. AKR1C3 shares high sequence identity >86% with related plastic human 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1), type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C2) and type 1 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C4), and reagents are urgently needed to discriminate between these enzymes at the mRNA, protein and functional level. We describe the characterization of a high-titer isoform specific monoclonal antibody (Ab) for AKR1C3. It does not cross react with human AKR1C1, AKR1C2 or AKR1C4, human aldehyde reductase AKR1A1 or rat 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C9) on immunoblot analysis. The monoclonal Ab can be used to detect AKR1C3 expression by immunohistochemistry in sections of paraffin-embedded mammary gland and prostate. In the breast enzyme staining was detected in ductal carcinoma in situ where the cancerous cells were strongly immunoreactive. In normal prostate immunoreactivity was limited to stromal cells with only faint staining in the epithelial cells. In adenocarcinoma of the prostate elevated staining was observed in the endothelial cells and carcinoma cells. The reagent thus has utility to access the localized expression of AKR1C3 in hormonal dependent malignancies of the breast and prostate.'"
AKR1A1,11535067,"'Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are metabolized to trans-dihydrodiol proximate carcinogens by human epoxide hydrolase (EH) and CYP1A1. Human dihydrodiol dehydrogenase isoforms (AKR1C1-AKR1C4), members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, activate trans-dihydrodiols by converting them to reactive and redox-active o-quinones. We now show that the constitutively and widely expressed human AKR, aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), will oxidize potent proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiols to their corresponding o-quinones. cDNA encoding AKR1A1 was isolated from HepG2 cells, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. AKR1A1 oxidized the potent proximate carcinogen (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene with a higher utilization ratio (V(max)/K(m)) than any other human AKR. AKR1A1 also displayed a high V(max)/K(m) for the oxidation of 5-methylchrysene-7,8-diol, benz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, 7-methylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol. AKR1A1 displayed rigid regioselectivity by preferentially oxidizing non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols. The enzyme was stereoselective and oxidized 50% of each racemic PAH trans-dihydrodiol tested. The absolute stereochemistries of the reactions were assigned by circular dichroism spectrometry. AKR1A1 preferentially oxidized the metabolically relevant (-)-benzo[a]pyrene-7(R),8(R)-dihydrodiol. AKR1A1 also preferred (-)-benz[a]anthracene-3(R),4(R)-dihydrodiol, (+)-7-methylbenz[a]anthracene-3(S),4(S)-dihydrodiol, and (-)-7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3(R),4(R)-dihydrodiol. The product of the AKR1A1-catalyzed oxidation of (+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene was trapped with 2-mercaptoethanol and characterized as a thioether conjugate of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione by LC/MS. Multiple human tissue expression array analysis showed coexpression of AKR1A1, CYP1A1, and EH, indicating that trans-dihydrodiol substrates are formed in the same tissues in which AKR1A1 is expressed. The ability of this general metabolic enzyme to divert trans-dihydrodiols to o-quinones suggests that this pathway of PAH activation may be widespread in human tissues.'"
AKR1A1,11399028,"'Several forms of diacetyl-reducing enzyme were found to exist in the human liver cytosol. Three (DAR-2, DAR-5, and DAR-7) of them were purified as a single band on SDS-PAGE by a combination of a few kinds of column chromatographies. The in-gel tryptic digests of the purified enzymes were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography (LC)/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS), which provided peptide masses at a ppm-level accuracy. The enzymes, DAR-2, DAR-5, and DAR-7, were identified as alcohol dehydrogenase beta subunit (ADH2), carbonyl reductase (CBR1), and aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), respectively, by peptide mass fingerprinting. In addition, an alternating-scan acquisition of nano-LC/FT ICR mass spectra, i.e., switching of normal acquisition conditions and in-source fragmentation conditions scan by scan, provided sets of parent and fragment ion masses of many of the tryptic peptides in a single LC/MS run. The peptide sequence-tag information at the ppm-level accuracy was used to further confirm the protein identities. It was demonstrated that nano-LC/FT ICR MS can be used for rigorous protein identification at a subpicomole level as an alternative technique to nano-LC/MS/MS.'"
AKR1A1,11306097,"'Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are metabolized to trans-dihydrodiol proximate carcinogens by CYP1A1 and epoxide hydrolase (EH). CYP1A1 or aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) from the 1C subfamily can further activate the trans-dihydrodiols by forming either anti-diol-epoxides or reactive and redox active o-quinones, respectively. To determine whether other AKR superfamily members can divert trans-dihydrodiols to o-quinones, the cDNA encoding human aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1) was isolated from hepatoma HepG2 cells using RT-PCR, subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector, overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity in milligram amounts. Studies revealed that AKR1A1 preferentially oxidized the metabolically relevant (-)-[3R,4R]-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrobenz[a]anthracene. AKR1A1 also displayed high utilization ratios (V(max)/K(m)) for the following PAH trans-dihydrodiols: (+/-)trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydro-7-methylbenz[a]anthracene, (+/-)trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydro-7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and (+/-)trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro-5-methylchrysene. Multiple tissue expression (MTE) arrays were used to measure the co-expressed of CYP1A1, EH and AKR1A1. All the three enzymes co-expressed to sites of PAH activation. The high catalytic efficiency of AKR1A1 for potent proximate carcinogen trans-dihydrodiols and its presence in tissues that contain CYP1A1 and EH suggests that it plays an important role in this alternative pathway of PAH activation (supported by CA39504).'"
AKR1A1,11060293,"'The human aldo-keto reductase AKR1C1 (20alpha(3alpha)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is induced by electrophilic Michael acceptors and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a presumptive antioxidant response element (Burczynski, M. E., Lin, H. K., and Penning, T. M. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 607-614). Physiologically, AKR1C1 regulates progesterone action by converting the hormone into its inactive metabolite 20alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and toxicologically this enzyme activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols to redox-cycling o-quinones. However, the significance of its potent induction by Michael acceptors and oxidative stress is unknown. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and other alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation were reduced by AKR1C1 with high catalytic efficiency. Kinetic studies revealed that AKR1C1 reduced HNE (K(m) = 34 microm, k(cat) = 8.8 min(-1)) with a k(cat)/K(m) similar to that for 20alpha-hydroxysteroids. Six other homogeneous recombinant AKRs were examined for their ability to reduce HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 possessed one of the highest specific activities and was the only isoform induced by oxidative stress and by agents that deplete glutathione (ethacrynic acid). Several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the AKR1C subfamily catalyzed the reduction of HNE with higher activity than aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). NMR spectroscopy identified the product of the NADPH-dependent reduction of HNE as 1,4-dihydroxy-2-nonene. The K(m) of recombinant AKR1C1 for nicotinamide cofactors (K(m) NADPH approximately 6 microm, K(m)(app) NADH >6 mm) suggested that it is primed for reductive metabolism of HNE. Isoform-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that exposure of HepG2 cells to HNE resulted in elevated levels of AKR1C1 mRNA. Thus, HNE induces its own metabolism via AKR1C1, and this enzyme may play a hitherto unrecognized role in a response mounted to counter oxidative stress. AKRs represent alternative GSH-independent/NADPH-dependent routes for the reductive elimination of HNE. Of these, AKR1C1 provides an inducible cytosolic barrier to HNE following ROS exposure.'"
AKR1A1,10510318,"'Complementary DNA clones encoding human aflatoxin B(1) aldehyde reductase (AKR7A2), aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), aldose reductase (AKR1B1), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 1 (AKR1C1) and chlordecone reductase (AKR1C4) have been expressed in Escherichia coli. These members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily have been purified from E. coli as recombinant proteins. The recently identified AKR7A2 was shown to differ from the AKR1 isoenzymes in being able to catalyse the reduction of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde. Also, AKR7A2 was found to exhibit a narrow substrate specificity, with activity being restricted to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine-2-aldehyde, isatin, 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone. In contrast, AKR1A1 reduces a broad spectrum of carbonyl-containing compounds, displaying highest specific activity for SSA, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine-3-aldehyde, pyridine-4-aldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, phenylglyoxal, methylglyoxal, 2,3-hexanedione, 1, 2-NQ, 16-ketoestrone and d-glucuronic acid. Comparison between the kinetic properties of AKR7A2 and AKR1A1 showed that both recombinant enzymes exhibited roughly similar k(cat)/K(m) values for SSA, 1,2-NQ and 16-ketoestrone. Many of the compounds which are substrates for AKR1A1 also serve as substrates for AKR1B1, though the latter enzyme was shown to display a specific activity significantly less than that of AKR1A1 for most of the aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes studied. Neither AKR1C1 nor AKR1C4 was found to possess high reductase activity towards aliphatic aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes, aldoses or dicarbonyls. However, unlike AKR1A1 and AKR1B1, both AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 were able to catalyse the oxidation of 1-acenaphthenol and, in addition, AKR1C4 could oxidize di- and tri-hydroxylated bile acids. Specific antibodies raised against AKR7A2, AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 have been used to show the presence of all of the reductases in human hepatic cytosol; the levels of AKR1B1 and AKR1C1 were markedly elevated in livers with alcohol-associated injury, and indeed AKR1B1 was only detectable in livers with evidence of alcoholic liver disease. Western blotting of extracts from brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spleen and testis showed that AKR7A2 is present in all of the organs examined, and AKR1B1 is similarly widely distributed in human tissues. These experiments revealed however, that the expression of AKR1A1 is restricted primarily to brain, kidney, liver and small intestine. The AKR1C family members proved not to be as widely expressed as the other reductases, with AKR1C1 being observed in only kidney, liver and testis, and AKR1C4 being found in liver alone. As human kidney is a rich source of AKR, the isoenzymes in this organ have been studied further. Anion-exchange chromatography of human renal cytosol on Q-Sepharose allowed resolution of AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1 and AKR7A2, as identified by substrate specificity and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry of human kidney demonstrated that AKR7A2 is expressed in a similar fashion to the AKR1 family members in proximal and distal convoluted renal tubules. Furthermore, both AKR7A2 and AKR1 members were expressed in renal carcinoma cells, suggesting that these groups of isoenzymes may be engaged in related physiological functions.'"
AKR1A1,10486210,"""Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2; AKR1A1) is involved in the reduction of biogenic and xenobiotic aldehydes and is present in virtually every tissue. To study the regulation of its expression, the human aldehyde reductase gene and promoter were cloned and characterized. The protein coding region consists of eight exons, with two additional upstream exons, separated by a large intron of 9.4 kb, that code for the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA. Two mRNA transcripts that encode the same protein and that originate from alternative splicing were identified. The shorter transcript is the major form as shown by Northern blots and reverse transcription-PCR experiments. Northern blots of multiple tissues indicate that aldehyde reductase mRNA is present in all tissues examined and is most abundant in kidney, liver, and thyroid, which is consistent with the tissue enzyme distribution. The two mRNA transcripts do not exhibit differential tissue distribution. A construct containing a promoter region insert in a pGL3 vector drives transcription of a luciferase reporter gene and is 290-fold more active than a control vector without insert in transfected HepG2 cells. The activity of the full promoter construct is comparable to that of a pGL3 vector containing the SV40 promoter with an enhancer. The promoter does not contain a TATA box, but contains multiple GC-rich islands and exhibits bidirectional activity in transfection studies. The major active promoter element was localized by nested deletions and mutations to a DNA element (TGCAAT, -59 to -54) that presumptively binds the transcription factor CHOP [CAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein]. Comparison of the aldehyde reductase gene structure to all other characterized human genes of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (aldose reductase, bile acid binder, and type I and type II 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases) indicates that it is more distantly related to these genes than they are among themselves."""

AKR1A1,9310340,"'The aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) represent a growing oxidoreductase superfamily. Forty proteins have been identified and characterized as AKRs, and an additional fourteen genes may encode proteins related to the superfamily. Found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the AKRs metabolize a wide range of substrates, including aliphatic aldehydes, monosaccharides, steroids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. This broad substrate specificity has caused problems in naming these proteins. Enzymes capable of these reactions have been referred to as aldehyde reductase (ALR1), aldose reductase (ALR2), and carbonyl reductase (ALR3); however, ALR3 is not a member of the AKR superfamily. Also, some AKRs have multiple names based upon substrate specificity. For example, human 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3apha-HSD) type I is also known as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 4 and chlordecone reductase. To address these issues, we propose a new nomenclature system for the AKR superfamily based on amino acid sequence identities. Cluster analysis of the AKRs shows seven distinct families at the 40% amino acid identity level. The largest family (AKR1) contains the aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases, and HSDs. Other families include the prokaryotic AKRs, the plant chalcone reductases, the Shaker channels, and the ethoxyquin-inducible aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase. At the level of 60% amino acid identity, subfamilies are discernible. For example, the AKR1 family includes five subfamilies: (A) aldehyde reductases (mammalian); (B) aldose reductases; (C) HSDs; (D) delta4-3-ketosteroid-5beta-reductases; and (E) aldehyde reductases (plant). This cluster analysis forms the basis for our nomenclature system. Recommendations for naming an aldo-keto reductase include the root symbol ""AKR,"" an Arabic number designating the family, a letter indicating the subfamily when multiple subfamilies exist, and an Arabic numeral representing the unique protein sequence. For example, human aldehyde reductase would be assigned as AKR1A1. Our nomenclature is both systematic and expandable, thereby allowing assignment of consistent designations for newly identified members of the superfamily.'"
