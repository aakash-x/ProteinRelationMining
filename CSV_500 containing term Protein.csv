30220108	2018	"""Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the world's largest source of natural fiber and dominates the global textile industry. Hybrid cotton varieties exhibit strong heterosis that confers high fiber yields, yet the genome-wide effects of artificial selection that have influenced Upland cotton during its breeding history are poorly understood. Here, we re-sequenced Upland cotton genomes and constructed a variation map of an intact breeding pedigree comprising seven elite and 19 backbone parents. Compared to wild accessions, the 26 pedigree accessions underwent strong artificial selection during domestication that has resulted in reduced genetic diversity but stronger linkage disequilibrium and higher extents of selective sweeps. In contrast to the backbone parents, the elite parents have acquired significantly improved agronomic traits, with an especially pronounced increase in the lint percentage. Notably, identify by descent (IBD) tracking revealed that the elite parents inherited abundant beneficial trait segments and loci from the backbone parents and our combined analyses led to the identification of a core genomic segment which was inherited in the elite lines from the parents Zhong 7263 and Ejing 1 and that was strongly associated with lint percentage. Additionally, SNP correlation analysis of this core segment showed that a nonsynonymous SNP (A-to-G) site in a gene encoding the cell-wall-associated receptor-like kinase 3 (GhWAKL3) protein was highly correlated with increased lint percentage. Our results substantially increase the valuable genomics resources available for future genetic and functional genomics studies of cotton and reveal insights that will facilitate yield increases in the molecular breeding of cotton.

30220106	2018	'Mounting evidence points to increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Endothelial dysfunction (loss of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in response to pro-vasodilatory stimuli) constitutes an early pathophysiological event in atherogenesis and CVD. Both HIV-1 infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are implicated in the development of endothelial dysfunction; however, conclusions are frequently drawn from associations shown in epidemiological studies. In this narrative review of mainly in vitro and animal studies, we report on the current understanding of how various HIV-1 proteins, HIV-1-induced proinflammatory cytokines and common antiretroviral drugs directly impact vascular endothelial cells. Proposed cellular mechanisms underlying the switch to a dysfunctional state are discussed, including oxidative stress, impaired expression and regulation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and increased expression of vascular adhesion molecules. From the literature, it appears that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, linked to decreased NO bioavailability and ensuing endothelial dysfunction, may be proposed as a putative final common pathway afflicting the vascular endothelium in PLWHA. The HIV-1-proteins Tat, Gp120 and Nef in particular, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and the antiretroviral drugs Efavirenz and Lopinavir, most commonly postulated to be primary causal agents of endothelial dysfunction, are also discussed. We conclude that, despite existing evidence from basic research papers, a significant gap remains in terms of the exact underlying cellular mechanisms involved in HIV-1 and ART induced endothelial dysfunction. Bridging this gap could help pave the way for future strategies to prevent and treat early cardiovascular changes in PLWHA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'
30220089	2018	'Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a general plant basal defense strategy against viruses. In this study, we showed that infection by Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) triggered ROS burst in Nicotiana benthamiana and in the natural citrus host, the extent of which was virus-dose dependent. Using Agrobacterium-mediated expression of CTV-encoded proteins in N. benthamiana, we found that p33, a unique viral protein, contributed to the induction of ROS accumulation and programmed cell death. The role of p33 in CTV pathogenicity was dissected by the gene knockout and complementation in N. benthamiana. In the citrus-CTV pathosystem, deletion of the p33 open reading frame in a CTV variant resulted in a significant decrease in ROS production, compared to that of the wild type CTV, which correlated with the invasion of the mutant virus into the immature xylem tracheid cells and abnormal differentiation of the vascular system. In contrast, the wild type CTV exhibited phloem-limited distribution and minor effect on the vasculature. We conclude that the p33 protein is a CTV effector that negatively affects virus pathogenicity and suggest that the plant recognizes p33 to activate the host immune response to restrict CTV into the phloem tissue and minimize the disease syndrome.

30220083	2018	'B7 family members and their receptors play a central role in the regulation of T cell responses through T cell costimulation and coinhibition pathways that constitute very attractive targets for the development of immunotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we report that VSIG-3/IGSF11 is a ligand of B7 family member VISTA/PD-1H and inhibits human T cell functions through a novel VSIG-3/VISTA pathway. An extensive functional ELISA binding screening assay reveals that VSIG-3 does bind to the new B7 family member VISTA but does not interact with other known members of the B7 family. Under the same experimental condition, we did not observe any significant interaction between VSIG-8 and VISTA. In addition, VSIG-3 inhibits human T cell proliferation in the presence of T cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, VSIG-3 significantly reduces cytokine and chemokine production by human T cells including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-17, CCL5/Rantes, CCL3/MIP-1α, and CXCL11/I-TAC. Anti-VISTA neutralization antibodies attenuate the binding of VSIG-3 and VISTA, as well as VSIG-3 induced T cell inhibition. Thus, we have identified a novel ligand for VISTA that is able to inhibit human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. This unique VSIG-3/VISTA coinhibitory pathway may provide new strategies for the treatment of human cancers, autoimmune disorders, infection, and transplant rejection and may aid in the design of better vaccines.

30220059	2018	'Astrocytes express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) but its functions in these cells are not well defined. This study shows that the sustained exposure (8-72\xa0h) of mouse astrocytes to NMDA decreases the expression of the functional astroglia-specific proteins, glutamine synthetase (GS), and the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and also reduces GS activity. Similar to rat astrocytes (Obara-Michlewska et al. Neurochem Int 88:20-25, 2015), the exposure of mouse astrocytes to NMDA also decreased the expression of the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1. NMDA failed to elicit the effects in those cells incubated in the absence of Ca and in those in which the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR was silenced with GluN1 siRNA. The downregulation of GS, AQP4, and Kir4.1 observed in vitro may reflect NMDAR-mediated alterations of astrocytic functions noted in central nervous system pathologies associated with increased glutamate (Glu) release and excitotoxic tissue damage.'
30220058	2018	'Rett syndrome (RTT) is a postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects girls, with 95% of RTT cases resulting from mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Choline, a dietary micronutrient found in most foods, has been shown to be important for brain development and function. However, the exact effects and mechanisms are still unknown. We found that 13\xa0mg/day (1.7\u2009× required daily intake) of postnatal choline treatment to Mecp2-conditional knockout mice rescued not only deficits in motor coordination, but also their anxiety-like behaviour and reduced social preference. Cortical neurons in the brains of Mecp2-conditional knockout mice supplemented with choline showed enhanced neuronal morphology and increased density of dendritic spines. Modelling RTT in vitro by knocking down the expression of the MeCP2 protein with shRNA, we found that choline supplementation to MeCP2-knockdown neurons increased their soma sizes and the complexity of their dendritic arbors. Rescue of the morphological defects could lead to enhanced neurotransmission, as suggested by an observed trend of increased expression of synaptic proteins and restored miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency in choline-supplemented MeCP2-knockdown neurons. Through the use of specific inhibitors targeting each of the known physiological pathways of choline, synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline was found to be essential in bringing about the changes seen in the choline-supplemented MeCP2-knockdown neurons. Taken together, these data reveal a role of choline in modulating neuronal plasticity, possibly leading to behavioural changes, and hence, a potential for using choline to treat RTT.'
30220054	2018	'PURPOSE: Metaplastic breast carcinomas are an aggressive subtype of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in which part or all of the adenocarcinoma transforms into a non-glandular component (e.g., spindled, squamous, or heterologous). We discovered that mammary-specific Ccn6/Wisp3 knockout mice develop mammary\xa0carcinomas with spindle and squamous differentiation that share upregulation of the oncofetal proteins IGF2BP2 (IMP2) and HMGA2 with human metaplastic carcinomas. Here, we investigated the functional\xa0relationship between CCN6,\xa0IGF2BP2, and HMGA2 proteins\xa0in vitro and in vivo, and\xa0their expression in human tissue samples.\n\nMETHODS: MMTV-cre;Ccn6 tumors and spindle TNBC cell lines were treated with recombinant CCN6 protein or vehicle. IGF2BP2 was downregulated using shRNAs\xa0in\xa0HME cells with stable CCN6 shRNA knockdown, and subjected to invasion and adhesion assays.\xa0Thirty-one human\xa0metaplastic carcinomas\xa0were arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) and immunostained for CCN6, IGF2BP2, and HMGA2.\n\nRESULTS: CCN6 regulates IGF2BP2 and HMGA2 protein expression in MMTV-cre;Ccn6\xa0tumors, in MDA-MB-231 and -\u2009468, and in HME cells. CCN6 recombinant protein reduced IGF2BP2 and HMGA2 protein\xa0expression, and decreased growth of MMTV-cre;Ccn6 tumors in vivo. IGF2BP2 shRNA knockdown was sufficient to reverse the invasive abilities conferred by CCN6 knockdown in HME cells. Analyses of the TCGA Breast Cancer Cohort (n\u2009=\u20091238) showed that IGF2BP2 and HMGA2 are significantly upregulated in metaplastic carcinoma compared to other breast cancer\xa0subtypes. In clinical samples, low CCN6 is frequent in tumors\xa0with\xa0high IGF2BP2/HMGA2 with spindle and squamous differentiation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data shed light into the pathogenesis of metaplastic carcinoma and demonstrate a novel CCN6/IGF2BP2/HMGA2 oncogenic pathway with biomarker and\xa0therapeutic implications.'
30220049	2018	"""Ensemble methods are gaining more importance in structure-based approaches as single protein-ligand complexes strongly influence the outcomes of virtual screening. Structure-based pharmacophore modeling based on a single protein-ligand complex with complex feature combinations is often limited to certain chemical classes. The REPHARMBLE (receptor pharmacophore ensemble) approach presented here examines the ability of an ensemble of selected protein-ligand complexes to populate pharmacophore space in the ligand binding site, rigorously assesses the importance of pharmacophore features using Poisson statistic and information theory-based entropy calculations, and generates pharmacophore models with high probabilities. In addition, an ensemble scoring function that combines all the resultant high-scoring pharmacophore models to score molecules is derived. The REPHARMBLE approach was evaluated on ten DUD-E benchmark datasets and afforded good screening performance, as measured by receiver operating characteristic, enrichment factor and Güner-Henry score. Although one of the high-scoring models achieved superior statistical results in each dataset, the ensemble scoring function balanced the shortcomings of each model and passed with close performance measures. This approach offers a reliable way of choosing the best-scoring features to build four-feature pharmacophore queries and customize a target-biased 'pharmacophore ensemble' scoring function for subsequent virtual screening."""
30220037	2018	'Advances in molecular techniques used in viral metagenomics coupled with high throughput sequencing is rapidly expanding our knowledge of plant-associated virus diversity. Applying such approaches, we have identified five novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses from Poaceae and Apiaceae plant from South Africa and New Zealand. These viruses have a simple genomic organization, including two open reading frames that likely encode a Rep and a capsid protein (CP), a conserved nonanucleotide motif on the apex of a putative stem loop structure, and conserved rolling-circle replication and helicase motifs within their likely Rep: all suggesting that they replicate through rolling-circle replication. The Reps and the CPs putatively encoded by these five novel viruses share low to moderate degrees of similarity (22.1 - 44.6%) with other CRESS DNA viruses.'
30220032	2018	"""A novel double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, which was provisionally named Arthrocladiella mougeotii endornavirus (AmEV), was isolated from Arthrocladiella mougeotii, the phytopathogenic fungus infecting Lycium chinense in Beijing, China. The genome of AmEV is 11,683 nucleotides in length with a 5' and 3' non-coding region of 16 and 50 nt, respectively, as well as a single 11,617-nt long open reading frame potentially encoding a putative protein of 3,871 amino acids with conserved Helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the the amino acid sequence of the RdRp showed that AmEV is most closely related to Erysiphe cichoracearum endornavirus (EcEV)."""
30220031	2018	'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimer of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and its key role in the regulation of cellular responses to hypoxia has been well-demonstrated. The participation of HIF-1α in apoptosis has been reported in mammals, however, a little information is available on the role of HIF-1α in the progression of apoptosis in fish. In this study, to know the role of HIF-1α in the apoptosis of fish cells, we produced HIF-1α knockout Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells using a CRISPR/Cas9 vector, and a single cell clone showing a heterozygous insertion/deletion (indel) mutation (one nucleotide insertion and one nucleotide deletion in HIF-1α gene) was chosen for further experiments. To confirm the knockout of HIF-1α, cells were transfected with a hypoxia reporting vector containing hypoxic response elements (HREs). EPC cells transfected with the reporting plasmids showed significantly increased luminescence by exposure to cobalt chloride, a prolyl hydroxylases inhibitor. On the other hand, HIF-1α knockout EPC cells showed a non-responsiveness to a cobalt chloride exposure, suggesting that functional HIF-1α protein was not produced in the HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. Apoptosis progression induced by camptothecin and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection was severely inhibited by HIF-1α knockout, and the replication of VHSV was significantly retarded in HIF-1α knockout EPC cells. These results suggest that HIF-1α in EPC cells acts as a pro-apoptotic factor in the progression of apoptosis triggered by a DNA damaging agent and rhabdoviral infection.'
30220025	2018	'PURPOSE: Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia (PE) and associated with the human vitamin E-binding protein afamin. The aim of this study was, therefore, to analyse afamin in the first trimester of patients developing PE later in pregnancy and in control subjects without pregnancy complications.\n\nMETHODS: In this retrospective study, 137 serum samples from the first trimester of pregnancy were analysed in a case-control study design. 39 patients developed PE (10 patients with early-onset and 29 patients with late onset disease) and 98 women had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Mann-Whitney U test, t test, logistic regression and ROC analyses were performed for statistical evaluation.\n\nRESULTS: Pregnant women developing PE presented with higher afamin concentrations in the first trimester [median 101.81\xa0mg/L; interquartile range (IQR) 88.94-113.26] compared to subjects with uncomplicated pregnancy (median 86.40; IQR 75.26-96.92; p\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting for confounders, the odds ratio per afamin standard deviation was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.04-2.58; p\u2009=\u20090.04). An afamin threshold concentration of 87.8\xa0mg/L exhibited the best sensitivity (79.5%) and specificity (57.1%) in predicting PE. Subgroup analysis of early- and late-onset disease resulted in substantially higher afamin concentrations in women with developing late-onset PE compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with an odds ratio per afamin standard deviation of 1.62 (95% CI: 0.98-2.70; p\u2009=\u20090.06).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum afamin concentrations are elevated in the first trimester among patients developing PE compared to controls. Substantial differences were observed mainly among patients with late-onset PE.'
30220021	2018	"""Previous study revealed that microRNA (miR)-150 might function as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma partially by targeting Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 mRNA-Binding Protein 1 (IGF2BP1). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-150-IGF2BP1 axis in human osteosarcoma which remains unclear. At first, expression levels of miR-150, and IGF2BP1 mRNA and protein in 20 osteosarcoma and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues were respectively detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Then, subcellular localization and expression pattern of IGF2BP1 protein in 100 osteosarcoma tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry. Associations of miR-150/IGF2BP1 expression with various clinicopathological features and patients' prognosis were also statistically evaluated. As a result, miR-150 expression was significantly decreased, while IGF2BP1 mRNA and protein expression were dramatically increased in osteosarcoma tissues compared to matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). Immunostaining of IGF2BP1 protein was localized in cytoplasm of tumor cells in osteosarcoma tissues. Statistically, low miR-150 expression and/or high IGF2BP1 protein immunoreactive score were all significantly associated with high tumor grade, presence of metastasis and recurrence, as well as poor response to chemotherapy (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, miR-150, IGF2BP1 and combined miR-150/IGF2BP1 expressions were all identified as independent prognostic factors for overall and disease-free survivals of osteosarcoma patients (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). In conclusion, our data suggest that miR-150 and its downstream target IGF2BP1 may be a crucial axis for the development, progression and patients' prognosis of ostesarcoma. The newly identified miR-150/IGF2BP1 axis might be a novel potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment."""
30220016	2018	"'The present study aimed to isolate and identify the potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditionally fermented wheat flour dough known as ""babroo."" A total of 26 lactic isolates were obtained from 50 different samples collected from different locations of the Himalayan province (Himachal Pradesh). To ascertain non-pathogenic nature, the isolates were screened by hemolytic activity leading to 20 non-hemolytic strains which were subjected to tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Seven different strains were selected based on their tolerance to gastrointestinal conditions. All the selected seven isolates were found to be susceptible to ampicillin and resistant to gentamicin. The phylogenetic analysis revealed three different strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, and two of Pediococcus acidilactici. The isolates exhibit different degrees of cell surface hydrophobicity (20.0-42.0%), cellular autoaggregation (5.0-41.0%), and adhesion to mucin (35.0-78.0%). The different lactic strains also possessed higher antioxidant properties (87.6-92.9%) determined in terms of free radical scavenging activity, bile salt hydrolase activity, cholesterol lowering activity (49.0-75.0%), and exopolysaccharide production. The principal component analysis (PCA) on probiotic attributes indicated that L. plantarum K90, L. fermentum K75, and L. fermentum K78 can be used as potential probiotic candidates.'"
30219981	2018	'Bovine mastitis causes severe economic losses to dairy farmers. Staphylococcus aureus, is one of the most important pathogen implicated in etiology of clinical and subclinical mastitis in bovines. In view of increasing antimicrobial resistance alternatives to antibiotic therapy are much needed. The present decade has witnessed a renewed interest in phage based therapeutics and diagnostics. The present study, describes isolation and characterization of two lytic phages SAJK-IND and MSP against Staphylococcus aureus having a potential to be used in therapy against mastitis. SAJK-IND and MSP phages belonged to Myoviridae and Podoviridae families, respectively. TEM imaging of the two phages revealed an iscosahedral head. MSP phage has a short non contractile tail. SAJK-IND and MSP have a burst size of 44\u2009±\u20093 and 25\u2009±\u20095 PFU/ infected cell, respectively. SAJK-IND and MSP phages revealed ̴ 12 and ̴16 proteins, respectively on SDS-PAGE analysis. The lytic activity of the phages was specific for Staphylococcus aureus. SAJK-IND revealed 100% lytic activity against several strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from mastitis milk samples whereas, MSP had only 40% lytic activity. SAJK-IND phage genome was sequenced, assembled and deposited in Genbank under accession no MG010123.'
30219967	2018	"""Bone fractures represent a significant medical morbidity among aged population with osteoporosis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are suggested to have therapeutic potential to enhance fracture healing in such patients. Though BMP-mediated fracture healing has been well-documented in preclinical models, there has been no clinical study that demonstrated unequivocally that indeed a BMP when presented with an appropriate scaffold could provide basis for robust outcome for delayed or non-union diaphyseal bone fractures. This review presents a comprehensive insight towards the existing knowledge on the role of BMP signaling in bone formation and maintenance. Also therapeutic options based on BMP biology are discussed.A novel osteoinductive autologous bone graft substitute (ABGS) aimed to accelerate bone regeneration was developed and is currently being tested in the clinical setting. It comprises of a biologically compatible autologous carrier made from the patient's peripheral blood (autologous blood coagulum, ABC) and of rhBMP6 as an active ingredient. Such formulation circumvents the use of animal-derived materials, significantly limits inflammatory processes common in commercial bone devices and renders the carrier flexible, malleable, and injectable ensuring the ease of use. The ongoing clinical trials result will provide more detailed insights into the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bone healing effects in humans and potentially provide novel and safe therapeutic options for bone repair."""
30219962	2018	'PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with renal impairs. As a novel pathophysiological hallmark of OSA, chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) enhances apoptosis and autophagy. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of telmisartan on CIH-induced kidney apoptosis and autophagy in a mouse model of OSA.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were randomly allocated to normoxia, CIH, and CIH+telmisartan groups (n\xa0=\u200912 in each group). The CIH exposure duration was 12\xa0weeks. Mice in the CIH+telmisartan group received telmisartan administration. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and western blotting of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were conducted for evaluating apoptosis in kidney tissue. While the autophagy-related proteins, beclin-1 and LC3, were also observed via western blotting.\n\nRESULTS: The percentage of apoptotic cell in the CIH group was significantly higher than that of normoxia group; meanwhile, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels were increased in the CIH group than those of normoxia group (all p\xa0<\u20090.05). Compared with the normoxia group, mice in the CIH group had greater autophagy-related proteins (beclin-1 and LC3) expression. When compared to the CIH group, both the renal apoptosis and autophagy in the CIH+telmisartan group were decreased.\n\nCONCLUSION: The CIH accelerates renal apoptosis and autophagy levels. Telmisartan ameliorating those levels suggests that it might prevent renal impairs from the CIH in OSA patients.'
30219960	2018	'MAIN CONCLUSION: Oleanolic acid glucuronosyltransferase (OAGT) genes synthesizing the direct precursor of oleanane-type ginsenosides were discovered. The four recombinant proteins of OAGT were able to transfer glucuronic acid at C-3 of oleanolic acid that yields oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide. Ginsenosides are the primary active components in the genus Panax, and great efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms underlying dammarane-type ginsenoside biosynthesis. However, there is limited information on oleanane-type ginsenosides. Here, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that oleanane-type ginsenosides (particularly ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin IV and IVa) are the abundant ginsenosides in Panax zingiberensis, an extremely endangered Panax species in southwest China. These ginsenosides are derived from oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide, which may be formed from oleanolic acid catalyzed by an unknown oleanolic acid glucuronosyltransferase (OAGT). Transcriptomic analysis of leaves, stems, main roots, and fibrous roots of P. zingiberensis was performed, and a total of 46,098 unigenes were obtained, including all the identified homologous genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. The most upstream genes were highly expressed in the leaves, and the UDP-glucosyltransferase genes were highly expressed in the roots. This finding indicated that the precursors of ginsenosides are mainly synthesized in the leaves and transported to different parts for the formation of particular ginsenosides. For the first time, enzyme activity assay characterized four genes (three from P. zingiberensis and one from P. japonicus var. major, another Panax species with oleanane-type ginsenosides) encoding OAGT, which particularly transfer glucuronic acid at C-3 of oleanolic acid to form oleanolic acid 3-O-β-glucuronide. Taken together, our study provides valuable genetic information for P. zingiberensis and the genes responsible for synthesizing the direct precursor of oleanane-type ginsenosides.'
30219955	2018	'Patients presenting with neurological deficits and/or pain due to spinal metastasis usually require immediate or subacute surgical treatment. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether or not side effects of primary cancer location might influence postoperative complication rate. We therefore analyzed our spinal database to identify factors influencing early postoperative complications after surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases. From 2013 to 2017, 163 consecutive patients suffering from symptomatic spinal metastases were treated at our department. Early postoperative complications were defined as any postoperative event requiring additional medical or surgical treatment within 30\xa0days of spinal surgery. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for postoperative complications after surgery for spinal metastasis. Overall, 39 of 163 patients who underwent spinal surgery for spinal metastasis developed early postoperative complications throughout the treatment course (24%). Preoperative ASA score ≥\u20093 (p\u2009=\u20090.003), preoperative C-reactive protein level >\u200910\xa0mg/l (p\u2009=\u20090.008), preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score <\u200960% (p\u2009=\u20090.03), radiation treatment within 2\xa0months of surgery (p\u2009=\u20090.01), presence of diabetes mellitus (p\u2009=\u20090.008), and preoperative complete neurological impairment (p\u2009=\u20090.04) were significant and independent predictors for early postoperative complications in patients with surgery for spinal metastasis. The ability to preoperatively predict postoperative complication risk is valuable to select critically ill patients at higher risk requiring special attention. Therefore, the present study identified several significant and independent risk factors for the development of early postoperative complication in patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastasis.'
30219944	2018	'Mammalian hibernation is a natural process in which the brain undergoes profound adaptive changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme hypoxia and hypothermia. In addition to a virtual cessation of neural and metabolic activity, these changes include a decrease in adult neurogenesis; the retraction of neuronal dendritic trees; changes in dendritic spines and synaptic connections; fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus; and the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Furthermore, alterations of microglial cells also occur in torpor. Importantly, all of these changes are rapidly and fully reversed when the animals arouse from torpor state, with no apparent brain damage occurring. Thus, hibernating animals are excellent natural models to study different aspects of brain plasticity. The axon initial segment (AIS) is critical for the initiation of action potentials in neurons and is an efficient site for the regulation of neural activity. This specialized structure-characterized by the expression of different types of ion channels and adhesion, scaffolding and cytoskeleton proteins-is subjected to morpho-functional plastic changes upon variations in neural activity or in pathological conditions. Here, we used immunocytochemistry and 3D confocal microscopy reconstruction techniques to measure the possible morphological differences in the AIS of neocortical (layers II-III and V) and hippocampal (CA1) neurons during the hibernation of the Syrian hamster. Our results indicate that the general integrity of the AIS is resistant to the ischemia/hypoxia conditions that are characteristic of the torpor phase of hibernation. In addition, the length of the AIS significantly increased in all the regions studied-by about 16-20% in torpor animals compared to controls, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms in response to a decrease in neuronal activity during the torpor phase of hibernation. Furthermore, in double-labeling experiment, we found that the AIS in layer V of torpid animals was longer in neurons expressing phospho-tau than in those not labeled for phospho-tau. This suggests that AIS plastic changes were more marked in phospho-tau accumulating neurons. Overall, the results further emphasize that mammalian hibernation is a good physiological model to study AIS plasticity mechanisms in non-pathological conditions.'
30219925	2018	'Peroxisomes are key metabolic organelles, which contribute to cellular lipid metabolism, e.g. the β-oxidation of fatty acids and the synthesis of myelin sheath lipids, as well as cellular redox balance. Peroxisomal dysfunction has been linked to severe metabolic disorders in man, but peroxisomes are now also recognized as protective organelles with a wider significance in human health and potential impact on a large number of globally important human diseases such as neurodegeneration, obesity, cancer, and age-related disorders. Therefore, the interest in peroxisomes and their physiological functions has significantly increased in recent years. In this review, we intend to highlight recent discoveries, advancements and trends in peroxisome research, and present an update as well as a continuation of two former review articles addressing the unsolved mysteries of this astonishing organelle. We summarize novel findings on the biological functions of peroxisomes, their biogenesis, formation, membrane dynamics and division, as well as on peroxisome-organelle contacts and cooperation. Furthermore, novel peroxisomal proteins and machineries at the peroxisomal membrane are discussed. Finally, we address recent findings on the role of peroxisomes in the brain, in neurological disorders, and in the development of cancer.'
30219914	2018	'The central dogma of molecular biology explains the fundamental flow of genetic information for life. Although genome sequence (DNA) itself is a static chemical signature, it includes multiple layers of information composed of messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small RNAs, all of which are involved in protein synthesis, and is passing from parents to offspring via DNA. Methylation is a biologically important modification, because DNA, RNAs, and proteins, components of the central dogma, are methylated by a set of methyltransferases. Recent works focused on understanding a variety of biological methylation have shed light on new regulation of cellular functions. In this review, we briefly discuss some of those recent findings of methylation, including DNA, RNAs, and proteins.'
30219905	2018	'The Varroa destructor (Acari Varroidae) mite is a serious threat to honey bee due to hemolymph feeding and virus transmission. Mite salivary proteins are involved in these interactions. However, the salivary secretome has not been previously characterized. In this paper, the saliva of V. destructor was found to be toxic to the worker larvae of Apis cerana (Hymenoptera Apidae) in the absence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and to stimulate the development of deformed wings in Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera Apidae) adults in the presence of DWV. The salivary secretome was analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS). A search of the resulting data against peptide databases using the software Mascot yielded 356, 53, and 9 matched proteins from V. destructor, A. mellifera, and DWV, respectively. The saliva contained Varroa mite proteins identified as important for potential virulence to A. cerana larvae, for the inhibition of harmful microorganisms, for the utilization of bee nutrients, and for antioxidant, oxidation-reduction and detoxification functions as well as A. mellifera proteins identified as nutrients important for mite reproduction. The saliva proteins also contained viral proteins from one virus, DWV. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding the interactions among the Varroa mite, honeybee, and DWV.'
30219894	2018	'DEAD-Box proteins (DBPs) constitute a prominent class of RNA remodeling factors that play a role in virtually all aspects of RNA metabolism. To better define their cellular functions, deletions in the genes encoding each of the Escherichia coli DBPs were combined with mutations in genes encoding different Ribonucleases (RNases). Significantly, double-deletion strains lacking Ribonuclease R (RNase R) and either the DeaD or SrmB DBP were found to display growth defects and an enhanced accumulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments. As RNase R is known to play a key role in removing rRNA degradation products, these observations initially suggested that these two DBPs could be directly involved in the same process. However, additional investigations indicated that DeaD and SrmB-dependent rRNA breakdown is caused by delays in ribosome assembly that increase the exposure of nascent RNAs to endonucleolytic cleavage. Consistent with this notion, mutations in factors known to be important for ribosome assembly also resulted in enhanced rRNA breakdown. Additionally, significant levels of rRNA breakdown products could be visualized in growing cells even in the absence of assembly defects. These findings reveal a hitherto unappreciated mechanism of rRNA degradation under conditions of both normal and abnormal ribosome assembly.'
30219888	2018	'Background: Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is an effective treatment for certain patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Tumour response is highly variable; no biomarker in clinical practice has been demonstrated to reliably predict outcome. The Inflammation-Based Index (IBI), derived from serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels, predicts survival and response to treatment in patients in a number of cancer types and was therefore explored in this setting.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Clinico-pathological data from patients undergoing PRRT for metastatic NETs were collected at baseline and during treatment. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) with a secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis tested associations between baseline variables and their dynamic changes, and PFS and OS. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the net benefit associated with a treatment strategy determined by the baseline IBI and non-response to PRRT.\n\nResults: Fifty-five patients were recruited. Baseline IBI >0 was associated with inferior PFS (HR 14.2 (95% CI 5.25-38.5), p<0.001) and OS (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed an independent association between IBI and PFS (p=0.001). DCA indicated a net clinical benefit at risk thresholds between 0.03 and 0.58.\n\nConclusion: Baseline IBI score and its dynamic change through treatment are associated with both PFS and OS. At a risk threshold equivalent to the currently accepted rate of non-response to therapy, implementation of this easily derived score could avoid a significant number of futile treatments. These findings should be validated in additional independent cohorts.'
30219871	2018	'Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the disease-causing gene. This mutation leads to an abnormal polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-3, resulting in formation of mutant ataxin-3 aggregates. Despite several attempts to develop a therapeutic option for MJD, currently there are no available therapies capable of delaying or stopping disease progression. Recently, our group reported that reducing the expression levels of mutant ataxin-3 lead to a mitigation of several MJD-related behavior and neuropathological abnormalities. Aiming a more rapid translation to the human clinics, in this study we investigate a pharmacological inhibitor of translation - cordycepin - in several preclinical models. We found that cordycepin treatment significantly reduced: i) the levels of mutant ataxin-3; ii) the neuropathological abnormalities in a lentiviral mouse model; iii) the motor and neuropathological deficits in a transgenic mouse model and iv) the number of ubiquitin aggregates in a human neural model. We hypothesize that the effect cordycepin is mediated by the increase of phosphorylated AMPK levels, which is accompanied by a reduction in the global translation levels and by a significant activation of the autophagy pathway. Overall, this study suggests that cordycepin might constitute an effective and safe therapeutic approach for MJD, and probably for the other polyglutamine diseases.'

To develop such a switch, we rewired the signal pathway of human G-protein coupled receptor 40 to a chimeric promoter triggering gene expression through an increase of intracellular calcium concentration.\xa0This synthetic gene switch is responsive to physiologically relevant FFA concentrations in different mammalian cell types grown in culture or in a bioreactor, or implanted into mice. Animal recipients of microencapsulated sensor cells containing this switch exhibited significant transgene induction following consumption of dietary fat (such as Swiss cheese) or under hyperlipidaemic conditions, including obesity, diabetes and lipodystrophy.'
30219851	2018	'The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a domesticated cyprinid teleost closely related to the crucian carp. Goldfish domestication occurred in South China around 1,000 years ago. At least 180 variants and 70 genetically established strains are currently produced. These strains possess diverse phenotypes in body shape, coloration, scales, and fin, eye, and hood morphology. These include biologically interesting phenotypes that have not been observed in mutants of zebrafish or medaka. In addition, goldfish strains have been maintained in a non-wild environment for several hundreds of generations, and certain goldfish strains have phenotypes similar to some human diseases. The recent progress in the assembly of the whole genome sequence of goldfish provides strong tools for a genetic analysis of these phenotypes. The whole genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the goldfish genome 8-14 million years ago; this is one of the latest WGD in vertebrates. Goldfish are a useful model for studying genome evolution after the WGD event. This review focuses on the potential for goldfish as a model system in understanding the molecular basis of vertebrate development and evolution and human diseases.'
30219847	2018	"""Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a central player in Parkinson's disease (PD) but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain unclear. It has recently been suggested that nuclear aSyn may modulate gene expression, possibly via interactions with DNA. However, the biological behavior of aSyn in the nucleus and the factors affecting its transcriptional role are not known. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying aSyn-mediated transcription deregulation by assessing its effects in the nucleus and the impact of phosphorylation in these dynamics. We found that aSyn induced severe transcriptional deregulation, including the downregulation of important cell cycle-related genes. Importantly, transcriptional deregulation was concomitant with reduced binding of aSyn to DNA. By forcing the nuclear presence of aSyn in the nucleus (aSyn-NLS), we found the accumulation of high molecular weight aSyn species altered gene expression and reduced toxicity when compared to the wild-type or exclusively cytosolic protein. Interestingly, nuclear localization of aSyn, and the effect on gene expression and cytotoxicity, was also modulated by phosphorylation on serine 129. Thus, we hypothesize that the role of aSyn on gene expression and, ultimately, toxicity, may be modulated by the phosphorylation status and nuclear presence of different aSyn species. Our findings shed new light onto the subcellular dynamics of aSyn and unveil an intricate interplay between subcellular location, phosphorylation, and toxicity, opening novel avenues for the design of future strategies for therapeutic intervention in PD and other synucleinopathies."""
30219846	2018	'Background and aims: Mucosal healing is an emerging therapeutic goal that could result in clinical remission of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We sought to determine the role of engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1) in wound healing in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the underlying pathways.\n\nMethods: RNA transcriptome sequencing was performed to detect the expression profiles of mRNA between inflamed tissues and corresponding non-inflamed tissues of IBD patients, followed by GEO datasets and western blot analysis. The effects of ELMO1 overexpression or knockdown on cell migration and proliferation were determined. The dependence of these effects on Rac1 was assessed using a Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) and a Rac1 pull-down assay. We identified the underlying pathways involved by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model was established to evaluate the role of ELMO1 in colonic mucosal healing.\n\nResults: ELMO1 was upregulated in inflamed tissues compared with corresponding non-inflamed tissues. ELMO1 overexpression increased cell migration in a Rac1-dependent manner. Depletion of ELMO1 or NSC23766 administration abolished this effect. GO analysis revealed that ELMO1 overexpression preferentially affected pathways involved in cytoskeletal regulation and wound healing, which was demonstrated by enhanced F-actin staining and increased numbers of extending lamellipodia in cells overexpressing ELMO1. In DSS-induced colitis, systemic delivery of pSin-EF2-ELMO1-Pur attenuated colonic inflammation and promoted recovery from colonic injury. The protective effect of ELMO1 was dependent on Rac1 activation.\n\nConclusions: ELMO1 protects against DSS-induced colonic injury in mice through its effect on epithelial migration via Rac1 activation.'
30219844	2018	'Motivation: Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that may act individually or interact with others in a phenomenon termed PTM cross-talk. Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs co-exist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides.\n\nResults: Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.\n\nAvailability: TCellXTalk is available at https://www.tcellxtalk.org.

30219816	2018	'BACKGROUND: In hemodialysis (HD) patients, impaired gut barrier and alteration in microbiota in the gut is thought to increase the risk of bacterial translocation and chronic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase reactant that mediates immune responses triggered by microbial products. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of LBP, and various metabolic and inflammatory markers in HD patients. Besides, we also aim to determine its relationship among -patients with different body mass index.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 123 HD patients were stratified into three -tertiles, according to serum LBP level. The LBP and inflammatory markers were determined using immunoassay methods. A bioimpedance spectroscopy device was used for body composition measurement.\n\nRESULTS: The serum levels of the two proinflammatory markers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, were significantly higher in patients in the upper tertile when compared with the rest of the tertiles. In HD patients, a significant positive correlation was found between serum LBP levels and CRP, IL-6, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and fasting blood glucose levels. Patients with metabolic syndrome and pre-existing cardiovascular disease had higher LBP levels than those without metabolic syndrome. Besides, obese patients were also associated with higher serum LBP levels. Multivariate regression analyses showed that IL-6 level was the strongest correlate of LBP level, followed by hsCRP level and sCD14.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that elevated plasma LBP was associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. In addition, increased LBP level was correlated positively to markers of inflammation, and sCD14 levels.'

In clinical practice, it is very difficult to remove bilirubin, the most widely studied toxin, and particularly the unconjugated form, strongly albumin-bound. The aim of this in vitro study was to assess irreversible bilirubin adsorption as a protein-bound compound marker, using Cytosorb® (Cytosorbents Corp.), a new hemoadsorption device designed to remove cytokines.\n\nMETHODS: We performed 4 in vitro experiments, dynamic and static, with different albumin-bilirubin solutions.\n\nRESULTS: All experiments showed the resin's ability to break the albumin-bilirubin complex (Experiment 1, 2), leading to efficient bilirubin removal for 24 h (Removal Rate: 90% Experiment 3) with minimal albumin loss. No sign of bilirubin release from the charged resin was detected (Experiment 4).\n\nCONCLUSION: Cytosorb® seems a promising artificial liver support, thanks to its ability to adsorb bilirubin and its proven ability to modulate the cytokines involved in hepatic dysfunction."""
30219812	2018	'OBJECTIVE: <br>We evaluated whether gamma gap is associated with cognitive function among older adults and whether physical activity is favorably associated with cognition among those with an elevated gamma gap. <br> Materials (Subjects) and Methods<br>Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES were used to identify 2,352 older adults, ages 60-85. The gamma gap was evaluated from subtracting albumin from total protein (i.e., Gamma Gap = Total Protein (g/dl) - Albumin (g/dl). Those at or above 3.1 g/dl (31.0 g/L) were considered to have an elevated gamma gap.

30219799	2018	'Ovarian cancer has resulted in over 140,000 deaths reported annually, worldwide. This is often attributed to cellular changes in the microenvironment, including increased migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate metastasis. Recently, the ability of exosomes to communicate signals between cells (and promote cancer progression) has been established. In this study, we explored the effect of exosomes on cells present in the tumour microenvironment. Exosomes were isolated from ovarian cancer cells with different invasive capacity (high=SKOV-3 and low=OVCAR-3) by differential and buoyant density centrifugation and characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis, western blot and electron microscopy. Exosome secretion was positively correlated with invasiveness of releasing cells. Proteomic analyses identified common and unique proteins between exosomes from SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 with gene ontology analyses revealing that these exosomes are involved in the regulation of cell migration. Since the tumour microenvironment contains multiple cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells, we examined the effect of these exosomes on MSC and EC migration.\xa0Exosomes promoted MSC and EC migration in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect of exosomes isolated from SKOV-3 on cell migration was significantly higher compared to exosomes from OVCAR-3. Thus, we suggest that exosomes from ovarian cancer cells contain a specific set of proteins that are representative of its cell of origin and the invasive capacity.'

Moreover, ACPA-IgG and RF-IgM were additionally determined in HOSTAS and HC. The prevalence of autoantibodies was compared between HOA and HC and between erosive and nonerosive HOA. In HOSTAS, hand radiographs were scored (Kellgren-Lawrence, Osteoarthritis Research Society International osteophyte and joint space narrowing) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, representing inflammation, were assessed. Groups were compared using nonparametric tests.\n\nRESULTS: The prevalence of anti-CarP was low and not significantly different between the total HOA group and HC (6.6% vs 3.6%, p = 0.12). In HOSTAS, the prevalence of all tested autoantibodies was low (anti-CarP 7.1%, ACPA 0.8%, RF 6.1%), and there were no significant differences observed between HOA patients and HC or between erosive and nonerosive HOA. Further, radiographic damage and CRP levels were similar in anti-CarP+ and anti-CarP-, and RF+ and RF- HOSTAS patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of autoantibodies is similar in HOA patients and HC, and these autoantibodies are not associated with erosive disease, structural damage, or inflammation in patients with HOA, indicating that another mechanism is driving erosive disease.'
30219765	2018	"'OBJECTIVE: Recommendations regarding ""treat to target"" in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have stated that the target should be remission or inactive disease. Potential definitions include very low disease activity (VLDA), PsA Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) near remission, Disease Activity Index for PsA (DAPSA) or clinical DAPSA (cDAPSA) remission. Our aim was to investigate the proportion of patients who fulfill these definitions and how much residual active disease remained.\n\nMETHODS: This analysis used 2 datasets: first, trial data from the Tight Control of PsA (TICOPA) study, which included 206 patients with recent-onset (< 2 yrs) PsA receiving standard and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD); and second, an observational clinical dataset from Italy of patients receiving biological DMARD. Proportions achieving each of the 4 potential targets were calculated in each dataset and comparisons between treatment groups were performed in the TICOPA dataset. Levels of residual disease were established for key clinical domains of PsA.\n\nRESULTS: All measures could differentiate the TICOPA trial treatment groups (p < 0.03). Lower proportions of patients fulfilled the VLDA criteria compared to DAPSA or cDAPSA remission. PASDAS results were different between the cohorts. Residual active disease was low across all definitions although higher levels were seen in DAPSA and cDAPSA compared to VLDA, particularly for psoriasis. In all measures, the proportion with elevated C-reactive protein was similar and low.\n\nCONCLUSION: VLDA appears the most stringent measure. It ensures that significant active arthritis, enthesitis, and psoriasis are not present, in contrast with DAPSA and PASDAS, in which composite scores can ""hide"" active disease in some domains.'"
30219732	2018	'Social isolation in adolescence leads to lasting deficits in hippocampal-dependent tasks. The reported effects of isolation on learning and memory in the Morris water maze and synaptic-related proteins have been inconsistent. Moreover, the autophagy level and its effect on cognition in the isolation model are also not clear. In the present study, we did an extended isolation period up to six months to establish a stable and appropriate isolation model to investigate the cognitive changes associated with it. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was systemically administered to mice to determine the roles of autophagy activation on cognitive changes. We discovered that long-term post-weaning social isolation (L-PWSI) produced marked deficits in spatial learning and memory and inhibited CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP), but paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and input/output (I/O) curve were unaffected. The results further showed that the L-PWSI significantly decreased the protein expression levels of PSD-95, GluA1, NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus, and no significant changes in the extracellular release of glutamate and the protein expression levels of synaptophysin, synapsin I, GAP-43, NR2A and GABA. Moreover, we found that L-PWSI increased the protein expression of p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR and p62, whereas the protein levels of LC3B and Beclin1 were decreased indicating an inhibition in autophagy activity. Intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin significantly potentiated fEPSP slope and cognition-related proteins expression in the L-PWSI mice. These results therefore suggest that L-PWSI induces postsynaptic dysfunction by disrupting the interaction between AMPAR, NMDAR and PSD-95, and inhibit the autophagy activity which led to impaired spatial memory and cognitive function.'
30219731	2018	"""Diabetes mellitus (DM) can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients. However, no effective approaches are available to prevent its progression and development. Recently, autophagy dysfunction was identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This study was designed to investigate the effect of metformin on hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in diabetic encephalopathy (DE) by regulating autophagy clearance. db/db mice were randomly divided into four groups, db/+ mice were used as control group. Twelve-week old male db/db mice received consecutive intraperitoneal injection of 200\u202fmg/kg/d metformin or (and) 10\u202fmg/kg/d chloroquine for eight weeks. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to test cognitive functions before the mice were euthanized. Metformin attenuated cognitive impairment in db/db mice, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, restored the impaired autophagy in diabetic mice, all of which were reversed by inhibiting of autophagy activity. In high glucose-cultured HT22 cells, metformin increased autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, metformin enhanced autophagy activity in an AMPK dependent manner. These data show that metformin may reduce tauopathy and improve cognitive impairment in db/db mice by modulating autophagy through the AMPK dependent pathway. These findings highlight metformin as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DE."""
30219722	2018	'Enzymes are highly specific and selective due to their precise, intricate three-dimensional catalytic- structure. Electron transfer in enzymes normally occurs through an active-metal centers or tunneling events that are highly insulated by the surrounding globular protein structure. In case of electrochemically active enzymes/proteins, the distance between the redox-active cofactor and the electrode surface plays key role during direct communication. Therefore, the long electron-tunneling distance can be overcome by introducing mobile redox mediators such as nanostructures specially nanowires which can diffuse into and out of the enzyme active site, ferrying reducing or oxidizing equivalents with them. Therefore, nanowire-conjugated enzymes have gained great interest in the development of biosensor devices and other electrocatalytic-biological applications. Herein we present a comprehensive review about the electrochemical enzyme-based sensor using nanowires. Over the past decade, nanowires were investigated as a versatile platform for various applications including sensors and biosensors because of their high aspect ratio and a high surface-to-volume ratio. This review aimed to summarize some of the recent developments in the enzyme based sensor research that have been achieved with various metallic and non-metallic one-dimensional nanostructure i.e. nanowires. Due to low or no toxicity and biocompatibility, enzymes conjugated with nanowires are still highly specific, sensitive and biologically active. This review demonstrates the potential usability of nanowired-enzymes for the bioanalytical applications. The review includes various types of nanowires, mode of the enzyme integration or immobilization methodologies, probe modification, biosensor fabrication and real or spiked sample testing. Biosensor parameters such as linear range and sensitivity, selectivity and detection limit of reported sensors were also considered herein. We also introduce some of the new nanowire materials which have not yet been used for biosensing or biosensor application. The limitations, challenges and prospects for the use of nanowired-enzymes in electrochemical and other real-time sensing systems as well as fabrication technologies are also discussed in this review.'

30219717	2018	'BACKGROUND: Suicide is a fatal outcome for subjects with mental ill-health. Genetic factors and psychological correlates are believed to contribute to the risk of suicide attempts (SA), whereas both factors are reported to exert a small effect. This study therefore tried to investigate if combination of the two aspects can enhance the explanation of variance in SA.\n\nMETHODS: A common variant rs7713917 in HOMER1 gene was genotyped for 333 Chinese psychiatric patients with or without SA. Multifactorial risk models comprised of this variant and psychological correlates were identified by logistic regression analysis (LRA) and Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method separately, and then evaluated for their performance by biostatistical methods.\n\nRESULTS: An association of A-carrier genotypes in rs7713917 with an increased risk of SA was observed (OR\u202f=\u202f1.79, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.08-2.98). Although with a medium effect size, this variant alone could only explain 1.9% variance of SA. Interestingly, this study was the first time to show that the association of the rs7713917 and SA was significantly mediated by the NEO conscientiousness (NEOC) dimension (p-value\u202f=\u202f0.002), with a greater genetic effect observed in subjects with a low NEO-C level (OR\u202f=\u202f2.89, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.16-7.18) but not in subjects with an average or high level. Upon the LRA method, the multifactorial risk model constituted of the two interacted factors and their interaction effect could explain up to 17.0% variance, which was almost 9-fold higher than the one explained by the rs7713917 alone. Furthermore, this model owned a higher effectiveness than the three models identified by the MDR method (p-value\u202f<\u202f0.0007).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study identified an effective multifactorial risk model, in which the combination of the HOMER1 variant and the NEO-C dimension could enhance explanation of the variance of SA in Chinese. This pilot study may provide a novel avenue to investigate the pathogenesis of SA in psychiatric patients.'

In this study, SYT-SSX1 fusion protein sequence was retrieved from Uniprot and 3D structure was generated using I-TASSER modeling program. A structure based computational screening approach has been employed using Glide docking software to identify potential SYT-SSX1 small molecule inhibitors that bind to the junction region of the fusion protein. The obtained inhibitors were further filtered based on the docking score and ADME/T properties. Ten best fit compounds were chosen for in vitro studies. The anti-proliferative activities of these 10 compounds were screened in Yamato, ASKA (carries SYT-SSX1 fusion protein) and other sarcoma cell lines such as A673, 143B to understand the specificity of inhibition of the chosen compounds. The in vitro activity was compared against HEK293 cell lines. The compound 5-fluoro-3-(1-phenyl-1H-tetraazol-5-yl)-1H-indole (FPTI) was found to be selectively cytotoxic in synovial sarcoma cell lines (Yamato and ASKA) and this compound also showed insignificant anti proliferative activity on other cell lines. Further, target gene expression study confirmed that FPTI treatment down-regulated SYT-SSX1 and modulated its downstream target genes. Cell cycle analysis revealed the involvement of an apoptotic mechanism of cell death. Further experimental validations may elucidate the therapeutic potentials of FPTI against SYT-SSX1 fusion protein.'
30219713	2018	'The occurrence of triclosan (TCS) in the eggs of wild avian species is an emerging concern. We previously evaluated the effects of in ovo exposure to TCS on the liver transcriptome of chicken embryos and proposed adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). However, the key molecular events identified to be affected need to be verified at the protein level. Herein, we investigated the changes in the spectrum of hepatic proteins in TCS-treated chicken embryos by proteomic analysis to validate the key signaling pathways involved in the AOPs. We identified and quantified 894 unique proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. In the 0.1 (low dose), 1 (median dose), and 10\u202fμg triclosan/g egg (high dose) groups, TCS caused significant changes in the levels of 195, 233, and 233 proteins in males and 237, 188, and 156 proteins in females, respectively (fold changes > 1.3 or < 0.7). TCS exposure modulated the expression of proteins, predominantly involved in signaling pathways of lipid and energy metabolism in both genders. Among the proteins associated with TCS metabolism in the liver, phase I (e.g., CYP2C23a) and phase II (e.g., UGT1A1) enzymes mediated by chicken xenobiotic receptor, were only induced in males. In consonance with the malondialdehyde levels, which were increased upon TCS exposure in females in a dose-dependent manner, a battery of antioxidant enzymes, notably SOD2, GST, GSTz1, and PRDX1, was decreased and SOD1 and GSTK1 were increased in the embryos. Taken together, this proteome analysis complements the transcriptome profiling reported in our previous study and authenticates the AOPs proposed for chicken embryos in ovo exposed to TCS.'

30219702	2018	'Increased oxidative damage and disrupted redox signalling are consistently associated with age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Redox signalling can directly regulate biogenesis and degradation pathways and indirectly via activation of key transcription factors. Contracting skeletal muscle fibres endogenously generate free radicals (e.g. superoxide) and non-radical derivatives (e.g. hydrogen peroxide). Exercise induced redox signalling can promote beneficial adaptive responses that are disrupted by age-related redox changes. Identifying and quantifying the redox signalling pathways responsible for successful adaptation to exercise makes skeletal muscle an attractive physiological model for redox proteomic approaches. Site specific identification of the redox modification and quantification of site occupancy in the context of protein abundance remains a crucial concept for redox proteomics approaches. Notwithstanding, the technical limitations associated with skeletal muscle for proteomic analysis, we discuss current approaches for the identification and quantification of transient and stable redox modifications that have been employed to date in ageing research. We also discuss recent developments in proteomic approaches in skeletal muscle and potential implications and opportunities for investigating disrupted redox signalling in skeletal muscle ageing.'
30219679	2018	'Despite the advances in the discovery of various types of anticancer drugs for curing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), their toxicity and unfavorable side effects remained as big limitations for therapeutical applications. In this regard, natural products such as Streptomyces -derived agents have shown potential applications as anticancer drugs. The present study deals with evaluating the anti-carcinogenic activity of the ether extracted metabolites derived from Streptomyces on nalm-6 and molt-4 ALL cell lines. MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity effect of Streptomyces sp on nalm-6 and molt-4 cell lines. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by Flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to investigate the effect of these metabolites on the mRNA and protein expression levels of P53, Bax, and Bcl2. In both cell lines, extracted metabolites significantly inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis. Although P53, Bax mRNA and protein expressions were increased, Bcl-2 expression decreased in treated cells compared with control. In addition, the G0/G1 arrest of Nalm-6 cells was induced. These findings of this work show that the ether-extracted metabolites from Streptomyces levis ABRIINW111 can be used as an anti-carcinogenic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.'
30219676	2018	'Drug-resistant cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis, and targeting glycolysis is considered as a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) has been found to be a regulator of glycolysis, however, the role of PTBP1 in drug resistance remains to be elucidated. Herein, we found that PTBP1 was highly expressed in two drug-resistant colon cancer cell lines, vincristine-resistant HCT-8 cell line (HCT-8/V) and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cell line (HCT116/L-OHP). The levels of glucose consumption and lactate production as well as expression of pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) and hexokinase II (HK2) were elevated, while PKM1 level was reduced in HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells when compared with the HCT-8 and HCT116 cells. PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin, and caused reduction in glucose consumption and lactate production. PKM2 expression, but not HK2, was decreased and PKM1 expression level was increased in cells transfected with si-PTBP1. In addition, PTBP1 overexpression significantly induced glycolysis and reduced drug sensitivity, whereas the effects were attenuated by si-PKM2. Treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) also attenuated the effect of PTBP1 overexpression on drug sensitivity. In conclusion, PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of drug-resistant colon cancer cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin through repression of glycolysis. Our study provided a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in colon cancer cells.'

30219651	2018	'The fibrillins are large extracellular matrix molecules that polymerize to form microfibrils. Fibrillin microfibrils are distinctive architectural elements that are both ubiquitous in the connective tissue space and also unique, displaying tissue-specific patterns. Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) result in multiple distinct pleiotropic disorders. Most of the more than 3000 mutations known today in FBN1 cause the Marfan syndrome. Marfan mutations can occur in any of the 56 domains that compose fibrillin-1. In contrast, rare mutations in FBN1 that are confined to only certain domains cause several different types of acromelic dysplasia. These genetic disorders demonstrate that specific domains of fibrillin-1 perform roles important to musculoskeletal growth. Many of the phenotypes of acromelic dysplasias are the opposite of those found in Marfan syndrome. Knowledge of the functions and structural organization of fibrillin molecules within microfibrils is required to understand how one protein and one gene can be the basis for multiple genetic disorders.'

The latter is present in hemolytic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, whose carriers have hypocholesterolemia and low incidence of coronary artery disease.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize cholesterol fractions in patients with sickle cell disease and explore the relationship among lipoproteins, varying degrees of hemolysis, and its biomarkers.\n\nMETHODS: We recruited 37 healthy individuals, 39 with hemoglobin SC disease, and 40 with sickle cell anemia and quantified cholesterol fractions, heme resulting from hemoglobin breakdown, and its main scavenger protein hemopexin.\n\nRESULTS: Hypocholesterolemia was most significant in patients with sickle cell anemia, and cholesterol levels correlated positively with hemopexin. Nevertheless, patients still had higher relative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation than healthy subjects. Analysis of lipoproteins isolated by density ultracentrifugation showed that the LDL fraction contained higher concentrations of heme than the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, whereas HDL contained more hemopexin than LDL, albeit greatly reduced in patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings show that the abnormally low lipoprotein levels in sickle cell anemia correlate with hemolysis markers, particularly with hemopexin concentrations, along with significant reduction of this heme scavenger in HDL fractions. This may suggest an important role for HDL in the defense against heme-induced endothelial dysfunction in hemolytic diseases.'
30219639	2018	"""Inflammatory markers including C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are increasingly used within research and clinical settings. Yet, varying methodologies for cleaning immunoassay data with out of range (OOR) samples may alter characteristic levels of CRP, thereby obscuring interpretation and reliability. This study investigated the influence of eight immunoassay OOR data treatment techniques on salivary CRP (sCRP) samples from at-risk adolescents. Participants from the 'Sleep and Education: learning New Skills Early' (SENSE) Study were 86 adolescents at-risk for depression (50 female), aged 14.29 years (SD\u2009=\u20091.04). ANOVA results showed no statistically significant differences in average morning (F(7, 590)\u2009=\u20091.24, p\u2009=\u2009.28) and evening (F(7, 599)=1.29, p\u2009=\u2009.25) values produced by each OOR data cleaning technique. However, varying techniques produced differences in the magnitude of Pearson's correlations between consecutive saliva samples (r's between 0.27-0.78), and influenced the significance of a sCRP diurnal pattern; two techniques produced statistically higher morning than evening sCRP levels (t(85)\u2009=\u20092.70, p\u2009=\u2009.01 and t(85)\u2009=\u20092.67, p\u2009=\u2009.01), whereas six techniques failed to find statistical differences between morning and evening sCRP levels (p's >.05). Varying techniques also produced statistically divergent associations between sCRP and age and depressive symptoms. Results from this study provide evidence for the temporal stability of sCRP among adolescents, show winsorization as an effective OOR data management technique, and highlight the influence of methodological decisions in cleaning salivary biomarker data and the need for consistency within the field."""
30219637	2018	'OBJECTIVE: Identification of molecular signatures having key roles in hypobaric hypoxia by analysing the salivary proteome. Saliva holds a promising future in the search for new clinical biomarkers that are easily accessible, less complex, accurate, and cost effective as well as being non-invasive.\n\nMETHODOLOGY: We employed qualitative proteomics approach to develop discriminatory biomarker signatures from human saliva exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. Salivary proteins were analyzed and compared between age-matched healthy subjects exposed to high altitude (∼13700\u2009ft) for seven days (HAD7) with control subjects at sea level (Normoxia) by using 2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis/Mass Spectrometry approach.\n\nRESULTS: Several proteins with significant differential expression were found. The up-regulated proteins were apoptosis inducing factor-2, cystatin S, cystatin SN and carbonic anhydrase 6. The down regulated proteins were polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, alpha-enolase and prolactin-inducible protein. Further confirmation of the altered proteins such as alpha enolase, carbonic anhydrase 6, prolactin-inducible protein, apoptosis inducing factor 2, cystatin S and cystatin SN were performed using immunoblotting. The expression patterns of the selected proteins observed by immunoblot were in concurrence with 2-Dimesional gel electrophoresis results, therefore affirming the authenticity of the proteomic investigation.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the proof of concept of salivary biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of hypobaric hypoxia induced effects. It is highly feasible to turn these biomarkers into an applicable clinical test after large scale validation.'

Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between dyslipidaemia and IVDD, and to identify the possible mechanism by which dyslipidaemia aggravates the degeneration of intervertebral discs.\n\nMETHODS: Hyperlipidaemia rats were induced, thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: normal chow diet control group (CON) and high-fat diet group (HFD) for 8 weeks. And then, a rat disc degeneration model was established, rats were divided into three experimental groups: the normal chow diet\xa0+\xa0sham surgery group (CON-Sham); the normal chow diet\xa0+\xa0needle puncture group (CON-NP); and the high-fat diet\xa0+\xa0needle puncture group (HFD-NP), all rats were continually fed with normal chow diet or HFD 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the discs were harvested and histomorphological analysis, immunohistochemistry staining, real-time PCR and western blot were performed for all groups.\n\nRESULTS: The degenerative histological score of disc in the HFD-NP group was significantly higher than the CON-NP group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed remarkable reductions in aggrecan and collagen type II expressions, and significant increases in IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-13, HIF-1α and P65 expression in the HFD-NP group. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the mRNA levels and protein expressions of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 were higher in the HFD-NP group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperlipidaemia resulted in an exaggerated degenerative changes and altered expression and transcription of the degeneration-associated molecules in the rat disc tissue. These results raise the possibility that hyperlipidaemia may accelerate the progression of disc degeneration.'

30219599	2018	"""N6-methyladenosine (mA) is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Until now, two RNA demethylases have been identified, including FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) and ALKBH5 (α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homologue 5). As a mammalian mA demethylase, ALKBH5 significantly affects mRNA export and RNA metabolism as well as the assembly of mRNA processing factors in nuclear speckles, and ALKBH5 may play a significant role in these biological processes. Nevertheless, no modulator of ALKBH5 has been reported. The reason for that may be the lack of in vitro assays for ALKBH5 inhibitor screening. Herein, we describe the development of two homogeneous assays for ALKBH5 using N6-methyladenosine as substrate with different principles. Using ALKBH5 recombinant, we developed a formaldehyde dehydrogenase coupled fluorescence based assay and an antibody based assay for the activity evaluation of ALKBH5. These robust coupled assays are suitable for screening ALKBH5 inhibitors in 384-well format (Z' factors of 0.74), facilitating the discovery of modulators in the quest for the regulation of biological processes."""
30219582	2018	"""Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a Parkinson's disease (PD) related gene, translocates to impaired mitochondria and drives their elimination via autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. Mitochondrial pro-fusion protein Mitofusins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) were found to be a target for Parkin mediated ubiquitination. Mfns are transmembrane GTPase embedded in the outer membrane of mitochondria, which are required on adjacent mitochondria to mediate fusion. In mammals, Mfn2 also forms complexes that are capable of tethering mitochondria to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a structural feature essential for mitochondrial energy metabolism, calcium (Ca) transfer between the organelles and Ca dependent cell death. Despite its fundamental physiological role, the molecular mechanisms that control ER-mitochondria cross talk are obscure. Ubiquitination has recently emerged as a powerful tool to modulate protein function, via regulation of protein subcellular localization and protein ability to interact with other proteins. Ubiquitination is also a reversible mechanism, which can be actively controlled by opposing ubiquitination-deubiquitination events. In this work we found that in Parkin deficient cells and parkin mutant human fibroblasts, the tether between ER and mitochondria is decreased. We identified the site of Parkin dependent ubiquitination and showed that the non-ubiquitinatable Mfn2 mutant fails to restore ER-mitochondria physical and functional interaction. Finally, we took advantage of an established in vivo model of PD to demonstrate that manipulation of ER-mitochondria tethering by expressing an ER-mitochondria synthetic linker is sufficient to rescue the locomotor deficit associated to an in vivo Drosophila model of PD."""

The MIC and MBC for DMD was 78.1 and 156.3\u2009μg/ml, respectively. DMD also showed the ability to eliminate the clinical bacteria isolates with resistance to methicillin and vancomycin. The DNA polymerase and gyrase inhibition evoked by DMD for bacterial lethality was proposed. In the activated keratinocytes, DMD stopped the upregulation of chemokines (CCL5 and CCL17) and increased the expression of differentiation proteins (filaggrin, involucrin, and integrin β-1). Topical application of DMD facilely penetrated into the skin, with AD-like skin displaying 2.5-fold greater permeation than healthy skin. The in vivo assessment using the mouse model with OVA sensitization and MRSA inoculation revealed a reduction of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and bacterial burden by DMD by about 2- and 100-fold, respectively. Differentiation proteins were also restored after topical DMD delivery.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated an advanced concept of AD treatment by combined barrier repair and bacterial eradication with a sole agent for ameliorating the overall complications.'
30219519	2018	"""BACKGROUND: Recently, environmental pollutants have become a concern not only for respiratory organs but also for skin-related human health, because skin is localized at the border between the human body and the external environment and is easily influenced by environmental pollutants.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the effects of a novel pantothenic acid (PA) derivative, ethyl 2,4-dicarboethoxy pantothenate (EDCEP), on a diesel particulate extract (DPE) as a representative environmental pollutant that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling.\n\nMETHODS: We characterized the effects of PA and EDCEP on normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) exposed to DPE or HO as a general oxidative stress stimulator. Cell viability and intracellular ROS levels were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay, respectively. Further, we investigated the substantial effects and the underlying mechanism of EDCEP, which elicited a reduction of intracellular ROS.\n\nRESULTS: PA and EDCEP restored the decreases of cell viability induced by DPE and also repressed the up-regulation of CYP1A1 mRNA expression induced by DPE. Interestingly, the effects of PA and EDCEP on intracellular ROS levels showed different responses. EDCEP reduced intracellular ROS levels stimulated by DPE or by exposure to HO. EDCEP suppressed the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and reduced the level carbonylated proteins in reconstructed human epidermal equivalents topically treated with DPE. EDCEP up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), γ-glutamyl cysteine synthase (γ-GCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and in addition, increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels.\n\nCONCLUSION: EDCEP reduces cellular damage initiated by environmental pollutants by stimulating the intracellular defense system against ROS through the activation of Nrf2, and by interfering with AHR signaling pathway activation."""

Prepartum diets were formulated to provide a dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) of -21 (NEG) or -2 (NEU) mEq/100 g of dry matter (NEU) with either 1.3% or 1.8% Ca. After calving, cows remained on trial through 63 d in milk (DIM) and were fed a common lactation diet. Urine pH was lower for NEG compared with NEU and tended to be lower for 1.8% Ca compared with 1.3% Ca. Fractional excretion of Ca and Mg in urine was greater for NEG than for NEU. Prepartum plasma bicarbonate was lower and P was higher for NEG compared with NEU. Prepartum plasma P and blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio was higher for 1.3% compared with 1.8% Ca. Postpartum, concentrations of plasma total protein, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, Mg, and ionized Mg (iMg) were higher and Na was lower for NEU compared with NEG. An interaction of DCAD and Ca was observed for plasma creatinine, which was highest for cows fed NEU and 1.3% Ca compared with all other treatments. Interactions of DCAD and DIM were observed for plasma bicarbonate and iMg. Bicarbonate was higher at 3 DIM and lower at 14 DIM for NEU compared with NEG. Concentrations of iMg were higher at 1, 2, and 14 DIM for NEU compared with NEG. Interactions of Ca and DIM were observed for plasma Ca, Cl, and anion gap. Compared with cows fed 1.5% Ca, those fed 1.3% Ca had lower Ca and anion gap and higher Cl at 1 DIM and lower Cl and higher anion gap at 14 DIM. No differences were observed in body weight or body condition score due to DCAD or Ca. Prepartum dry matter intake (DMI) was lower for NEG compared with NEU and lower for 1.8% compared with 1.3% Ca. Postpartum DMI was not different among treatments. An interaction was observed for DCAD and DIM due to higher milk yield after 45 DIM for NEG compared with NEU. No differences were observed in milk component percentage or yield among treatments. There was an interaction of DIM and Ca for milk urea concentrations, which were higher at 5 wk and lower at 6 wk for 1.3% Ca compared with 1.8% Ca. These results suggest that feeding NEG prepartum alters plasma and urine mineral concentrations compared with feeding NEU and supports increased milk yield after 45 DIM. Feeding 1.8% Ca prepartum only improved plasma Ca at 1 DIM. Feeding either NEG or 1.8% Ca reduced DMI prepartum compared with NEU or 1.3% Ca.'

To validate the effects of these candidate variants on milk composition and to estimate their effects on cheesemaking properties, a genome-wide association study was performed on milk protein, fatty acid and mineral composition, as well as on 9 cheesemaking traits (3 laboratory cheese yields, 5 coagulation traits, and milk pH). All the traits were predicted from midinfrared spectra in the Montbéliarde cow population of the Franche-Comté region. A total of 194 candidate variants located in 24 genes and 17 genomic regions were imputed on 19,862 cows with phenotypes and genotyped with either the BovineSNP50 (Illumina Inc.) or the EuroG10K BeadChip. We then tested the effect of each SNP in a mixed linear model including random polygenic effects estimated with a genomic relationship matrix. We confirm here the effects of candidate causative variants located in 17 functional candidate genes on both cheesemaking properties and milk composition traits. In each candidate gene, we identified the most plausible causative variant: 4 are missense in the ALPL, SLC26A4, CSN3, and SCD genes, 7 are located in 5'UTR (AGPAT6), 3' untranslated region (GPT), or upstream (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, PAEP, DGAT1, and PICALM) regions, and 6 are located in introns of the SLC37A1, MGST1, CSN2, BRI3BP, FASN, and ANKH genes."""

This proposed bacteria detection method was able to detect E. coli O157:H7 as low as 12 cfu/mL when the large volume (10 mL) of bacterial sample was used, and the recovery of E. coli O157:H7 in the spiked milk samples ranged from 97.4 to 100.6%. This proposed bacteria-detection method has shown great potential to detect lower concentration of E. coli O157:H7 from larger volumes of sample.'
30219419	2018	'Essential amino acids (EAA) play an important role in promoting milk protein synthesis in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC). However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in the relationship between EAA and milk protein synthesis have not been fully explored. This study examined the effects of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS) on EAA-stimulated β-casein synthesis, cell proliferation, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) system in BMEC. First, BMEC were cultured in medium either lacking all EAA (-EAA) or that included all EAA (+EAA) for 12 h. The BMEC were then supplemented with the opposing treatments (-EAA supplemented with +EAA and vice versa) for 0 h, 10 min, 0.5 h, 1 h, 6 h, or 12 h, respectively. After the treatment-specific time allotment, proteins were collected for Western blotting. Subsequently, a 2 × 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the interactive of SARS inhibition (control or SARS inhibited) and EAA supply (+EAA or -EAA) on gene and protein abundance, cell viability, and cell cycle in BMEC. Based on the data obtained in the first experiment, the changes in protein abundance of β-casein and SARS depended on EAA treatment time in similar patterns. The protein abundance of β-casein, SARS, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related proteins, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and the mRNA abundance of cyclin D1 (CCND1, cell cycle progression marker) and marker of proliferation Ki-67 (MKI67, cell proliferation marker) were stimulated by the presence of EAA. Correspondingly, when cells were deprived of EAA, cell proliferation and abundance of these proteins and genes were reduced overall. Moreover, the decreases in these aspects were further exacerbated by inhibiting SARS, suggesting that an interaction between EAA and SARS is important for regulating protein synthesis. The results indicated that SARS stimulated the mTOR signaling pathway when EAA were present, enhanced EAA-stimulated cell proliferation, and contributed to increased β-casein production in BMEC.'
30219410	2018	"""Drug-fortified cationic liposomes of 6‑methoxy‑2‑naphthylacetic acid (6‑MNA) were prepared and characterized by various techniques. The residence time of drug-fortified liposomes in joint cavity was evaluated by intra-articular (IA) administration of the radio-labeled (Tc) liposomal formulation in the inflamed joints in rats. The cationic liposomal formulation composed of 6‑MNA (3) as an active agent, its double salt (4) with the lipid 1,2‑distearoyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as hydrogenated soyabean phospatidylcholine (HSPC) and 1,2‑dioleyloxy‑3‑trimethylammoniumpropane chloride (DOTAP) were developed using thin film hydration technique. The cryo-TEM analysis confirmed that the prepared optimized liposomal formulation (DFL-2) was a mixture of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). In addition, the TEM analysis confirmed that the prepared liposomes were of spherical in shape having liposome size in the range of 500-900\u202fnm and zeta potential of about +30\u202fmV. The developed cationic liposomes exhibited sustained release profile of payload of 6‑MNA for over >12\u202fh and about five times higher retention in the inflamed animal joints after 24\u202fh (by scintigraphy of the joints) as compared to the plain 6‑MNA solution when administered by IA route. The anti-inflammatory activity of prepared liposomal composition is evaluated by Freund's adjuvant induced arthritic model in rats. The liposomal formulation was well tolerated by all animals indicating good biocompatibility. Further, the cationic liposomal formulation treated group showed decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level in comparison to the control and the standard groups in the in vivo study. The improved efficacy of the drug-fortified liposomal formulation was due to the coupled effect of longer retention and sustained release of the active drug 6‑MNA in the joints. From the obtained results it could be concluded that the combined effect of the cationic charge on the drug-fortified liposomes and the inherent affinity of the active agent towards the synovial joint tissues, coupled with slow release of the active drug due to double salt approach at the site of administration could potentially decrease the frequency of IA drug administration. Hence such a formulation could prove to be a therapeutic boon for the management of late stage arthritis."""
30219386	2018	'Raf is a member in the Ras/Raf/MAPKK/MAPK signaling transduction pathway. To obtain a better understanding of Raf in the interaction between the Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the sequence of cDNA of Raf from F. chinensis (FcRaf) was obtained. The FcRaf gene contained a 2421 bp open reading frame (ORF). The FcRaf shared most characteristic of Raf protein, such as the Raf-like Ras-binding domain (RBD), phorbol esters/diacylglycerol binding domain (C1 domain), and catalytic domain of the serine/threonine kinases, Raf (STKc_Raf). The sequence of functional domains of Raf protein was relatively conserved. The FcRaf mRNA was detected in the tissues of gill, muscle, and hepatopancreas from normal F. chinensis. The mRNA abundance level of FcRaf in the gill was the highest, which was 2.7-fold the level in the hepatopancreas. The expression level of FcRaf was significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) up-regulated in the tissues of gill, muscle, and hepatopancreas post WSSV-infection, which suggested that FcRaf might be involved in the interaction between F. chinensis and WSSV. Two SNP loci were identified in the ORF, one of which was a C-T mis-sense mutation, where an Ala was replaced by a Val, and induced the predicted protein secondary structure change. Considering the relatively low MAF (0.07), whether this mis-sense mutation was a detrimental mutation needs further investigation.'
30219369	2018	'Better tools are necessary to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Modeling studies for regional Leishmania elimination indicate that an effective vaccine is a critical tool. Dogs are the reservoir host of L. infantum in Brazil and the Mediterranean basin, and therefore are an important target for public health interventions as well as a relevant disease model for human VL. No vaccine has been efficacious as an immunotherapy to prevent progression of already diagnostically positive individuals to symptomatic leishmaniasis. We performed a double-blinded, block-randomized, placebo-controlled, vaccine immunotherapy trial testing the efficacy of a recombinant Leishmania A2 protein, saponin-adjuvanted, vaccine, LeishTec®, in owned hunting dogs infected with L. infantum. The primary outcome was reduction of clinical progression, with reduction of mortality as a secondary outcome. Vaccination as an immunotherapy reduced the risk of progression to clinically overt leishmaniasis by 25% in asymptomatic dogs (RR: 1.33 95% C.I. 1.009-1.786 p-value: 0.0450). Receiving vaccine vs. placebo reduced all-cause mortality in younger asymptomatic dogs by 70% (RR: 3.19 95% C.I.: 1.185-8.502 p-value\u202f=\u202f0.0245). Vaccination of infected-healthy animals with an anti-Leishmania vaccine significantly reduced clinical progression and decreased all-cause mortality. Use of vaccination in infected-healthy dogs can be a tool for Leishmania control.'
30219368	2018	'BACKGROUND: Low efficacy of rotavirus (RV) vaccines in developing African and Asian countries, where malnutrition is prevalent, remains a major concern and a challenge for global health.\n\nMETHODS: To understand the effects of protein malnutrition on RV vaccine efficacy, we elucidated the innate, T cell and cytokine immune responses to attenuated human RV (AttHRV) vaccine and virulent human RV (VirHRV) challenge in germ-free (GF) pigs or human infant fecal microbiota (HIFM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs fed protein-deficient or -sufficient bovine milk diets. We also analyzed serum levels of tryptophan (TRP), a predictor of malnutrition, and kynurenine (KYN).\n\nRESULTS: Protein-deficient pigs vaccinated with oral AttHRV vaccine had lower protection rates against diarrhea post-VirHRV challenge and significantly increased fecal virus shedding titers (HIFM transplanted but not GF pigs) compared with their protein-sufficient counterparts. Reduced vaccine efficacy in protein-deficient pigs coincided with altered serum IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-γ responses to oral AttHRV vaccine and the suppression of multiple innate immune parameters and HRV-specific IFN-γ producing T cells post-challenge. In protein-deficient HIFM transplanted pigs, decreased serum KYN, but not TRP levels were observed throughout the experiment, suggesting an association between the altered TRP metabolism and immune responses.\n\nCONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings confirm the negative effects of protein deficiency, which were exacerbated in the HIFM transplanted pigs, on innate, T cell and cytokine immune responses to HRV and on vaccine efficacy, as well as on TRP-KYN metabolism.'
30219362	2018	'The effects of thawing methods (refrigeration thawing (RT, 4\u202f°C), water immersion thawing (WT, 18\u202f°C), vacuum thawing (VT, 25\u202f°C), ultrasonic thawing (UT, 20\u202f°C) and microwave thawing (MT)) on the conformation and gel qualities of myofibrillar protein (MP) obtained from porcine longissimus muscle were investigated. The results showed that MP conformation and gel qualities of porcine longissimus muscles by VT and UT were insignificantly changed compared to fresh meat (FM). A significant decrease in free amino groups of MP from MT illustrated that MT induced protein aggregation and oxidation (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The results of circular dichroism (CD) spectra analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy indirectly proved that thawing can cause protein cross-linking and degradation, secondary structure destruction, non-hydrophilic domain exposed and conformational change of samples. The largest changes in solubility, surface hydrophobicity and particle size were obtained with MT. The effects on the conformation and gel quality of MP were verified during thawing process.'
30219355	2018	'The impact of high intensity ultrasound (US, 45 and 20\u202fkHz) on a purified macromolecular fraction (more than 85% of polymeric procyanidins) from grape seed extract was investigated. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI-TOF), Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed a modification in the chemical structure of these macromolecules treated by US and, particularly, bath US produced a considerable increase of up to 49, 41 and 35%, respectively, of catechins and oligomeric and polymeric procyanidin contents of the treated purified fraction. Bath US also produced an important increase in the number of procyanidins with higher molecular mass (up to decamers) and an overall increase in the mass signal intensities in most of the detected B-type procyanidin series, as well as an important increase of the antioxidant activity of the macromolecular fraction of procyanidins. These results could be ascribed to a certain disaggregation of procyanidins linked to other biopolymers, such as proteins and/or polysaccharides, indicating that US is an efficient technology to modify the chemical structure and hence the bioactivity of tannins.'
30219335	2018	'In this study, we have reported a novel fabrication technique for human serum albumin (HSA) imprinted composite bacterial cellulose nanofibers (MIP-cBCNFs) used for the depletion of HSA selectively from artificial blood plasma for proteomic applications. Molecular imprinting was achieved by using metal ion coordination interactions of N‑methacryloyl‑(l)‑histidinemethylester (MAH) monomer and Cu(II) ions. MAH-Cu(II)-HSA complex was polymerized with bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs) under constant stirring at room temperature. The characterization of the MIP-cBCNFs was carried out by FTIR-ATR, SEM, contact angle measurements and surface area measurements. The adsorption experiments of HSA onto the MIP-BCNFs and NIP-BCNFs from aqueous HSA solutions were investigated in a batch system. The selectivity of the MIP-cBCNFs was investigated by using non-template human transferrin (HTR), and myoglobin (Myo). The relative selectivity coefficients of the MIP-cBCNFs were calculated as 4.73 and 3.02 for HSA/HTR and HSA/Myo molecules, respectively. In addition, the depletion of HSA from artificial human plasma was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and 2-D gel electrophoresis. As a result, it has been shown that metal ion coordination interactions contribute to specific binding of template when preparing MIP-cBCNFs for the depletion of HSA with a high adsorption capacity, significant selectivity and reusability.'
30219292	2018	"""Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been hypothesized to play a key role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the question of whether AD itself contributes to loss of BBB integrity is still uncertain, as many in-vivo studies have failed to detect signs of AD-related BBB breakdown. We hypothesize AD-related BBB damage is subtle, and that these negative results arise from a lack of measurement sensitivity. With the aim of developing a more sensitive measure of BBB breakdown, we have designed a novel MRI scanning protocol to quantify the trans-BBB exchange of endogenous water. Using this method, we detect increased BBB water permeability in a rat model of AD that is associated with reduced expression of the tight junction protein occludin. BBB permeability to MRI contrast agent, assessed using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, did not differ between transgenic and wild-type animals and was uncorrelated with occludin expression. Our data supports the occurrence of AD-related BBB breakdown, and indicates that such BBB pathology is subtle and may be undetectable using existing 'tracer leakage' methods. Our validated water-exchange MRI method provides a new powerful tool with which to study BBB damage in-vivo."""
30219286	2018	"""The saga of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) illustrates how disparate technical developments impact science. Starting with the classic 1976 Axelrod et\xa0al. work in Biophysical Journal, FRAP (originally fluorescence photobleaching recovery) opened the door to extraction of quantitative information from photobleaching experiments, laying the experimental and theoretical groundwork for quantifying both the mobility and the mobile fraction of a labeled population of proteins. Over the ensuing years, FRAP's reach dramatically expanded, with new developments in GFP technology and turn-key confocal microscopy, which enabled measurement of protein diffusion and binding/dissociation rates in virtually every compartment within the cell. The FRAP technique and data catalyzed an exchange of ideas between biophysicists studying membrane dynamics, cell biologists focused on intracellular dynamics, and systems biologists modeling the dynamics of cell activity. The outcome transformed the field of cellular biology, leading to a fundamental rethinking of long-held theories of cellular dynamism. Here, we review the pivotal FRAP studies that made these developments and conceptual changes possible, which gave rise to current models of complex cell dynamics."""
30219284	2018	'Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a microbial proton pump that is ubiquitous in marine environments and may play an important role in the oceanic carbon cycle. Photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore in PR leads to a series of proton transfers between specific acidic amino acid residues and the Schiff base of retinal, culminating in a proton motive force to facilitate ATP synthesis. The proton donor in a similar retinal protein, bacteriorhodopsin, acts as a latch to allow the influx of bulk water. However, it is unclear if the proton donor in PR, E108, utilizes the same latch mechanism to become internally hydrated. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to model the changes in internal hydration of the blue variant of PR during photoactivation with the proton donor in protonated and deprotonated states. We find that there is a stark contrast in the levels of internal hydration of the cytoplasmic half of PR based on the protonation state of E108. Instead of a latch mechanism, deprotonation of E108 acts as a gate, taking advantage of a nearby polar residue (S61) to promote the formation of a stable water wire from bulk cytoplasm to the retinal-binding pocket over hundreds of nanoseconds. No large-scale conformational changes occur in PR over the microsecond timescale. This subtle yet clear difference in the effect of deprotonation of the proton donor in PR may help explain why the photointermediates that involve the proton donor (i.e., M and N states) have timescales that are orders of magnitude different from the archaeal proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin. In general, our study highlights the importance of understanding how structural fluctuations lead to differences in the way that retinal proteins accomplish the same task.'
30219277	2018	'Therapeutic vaccination is and remains a major challenge, particularly in cancer treatment. In this process, the effective activation of dendritic cells by a combination of distinctly acting adjuvants and an antigen is crucial for success. While most common vaccine formulations lack the efficiency to trigger sufficient T cell responses in a therapeutic tumor treatment, nanovaccines offer unique properties to tackle that challenge. Here, we report the stepwise development of a nanocapsule for vaccination approaches, comprising a shell consisting of antigen and loaded with a superadditive adjuvant combination. In a first initial step, we identified the combination of resiquimod (R848) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) to have a superadditive stimulatory potential. Particulated in Spermine-modified dextran-nanoparticles, the dual-adjuvant maintains its superadditive character and stimulates murine dendritic cells (DC) stronger than the soluble equivalents. The second step was to evaluate a protein-based nanocapsule as suitable antigen source for the induction of antigen-specific T cell responses. Therefore, the DC-mediated antigen-specific T cell proliferation upon treatment with nanocapsules, whose shell consists of ovalbumin (OVA), was assessed. At least, the superadditive adjuvant combination was encapsulated into OVA-nanocapsules to create the final nanovaccine. Its immunostimulatory potential for DC was extensively tested by measuring the expression of co-stimulatory surface markers, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the capability to mediate OVA-specific T cell responses. The developed nanovaccine triggers strong superadditive dendritic cell stimulation and potent antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation. Combined with a high modifiability, an excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity and an enormous loading capacity, the introduced antigen-nanocapsule provides an enormous potential for the effective delivery of superadditive adjuvant combinations, particularly when they target intracellular receptors.'
30219269	2018	'Extracellular small RNAs (sRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), are promising biomarkers for diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), although their biological relevance is largely unknown. To investigate the relationship between intracellular and extracellular sRNA levels on a global scale, we performed sRNA sequencing in four muscle types and serum from wild-type, dystrophic mdx, and mdx mice in which dystrophin protein expression was restored by exon skipping. Differentially abundant sRNAs were identified in serum (mapping to miRNA, small nuclear RNA [snRNA], and PIWI-interacting RNA [piRNA] loci). One novel candidate biomarker, miR-483, was increased in both mdx serum and muscle, and also elevated in DMD patient sera. Dystrophin restoration induced global shifts in miRNA (including miR-483) and snRNA-fragment abundance toward wild-type levels. Specific serum piRNA-like sRNAs also responded to exon skipping therapy. Absolute miRNA expression in muscle was positively correlated with abundance in the circulation, although multiple highly expressed miRNAs in muscle were not elevated in mdx serum, suggesting that both passive and selective release mechanisms contribute to serum miRNA levels. In conclusion, this study has revealed new insights into the sRNA biology of dystrophin deficiency and identified novel DMD biomarkers.'
30219263	2018	'The current view of the neurobiology of learning and memory suggests that long-term memory (LTM) depends not only on the de novo protein synthesis but also on the synthesis of mRNA even hours after the acquisition of memory, as well as that the regulation of transcription through the histone acetylation is essential for the memory establishment. Our previous studies showed that protein synthesis inhibition around the time of training and 5 to 7\u2009hours after acquisition in the insular cortex (IC) prevents the consolidation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), a well-established learning and memory paradigm in which an animal learns to associate a novel taste with nausea. However, the participation of mRNA synthesis and the epigenetic regulation through histone acetylation in this process remains unexplored. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the inhibition of transcription as well as deacetylation of histones at two temporal windows on the consolidation of CTA. Thus, immediately or seven hours after CTA acquisition animals received a microinfusion of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or MS-275 in the IC, respectively. The present results show that transcription inhibition immediately and 7\u2009hours after acquisition impairs the CTA memory consolidation, whereas the inhibition of histone deacetylation strengths this memory at those temporal windows. These findings reveal that CTA memory requires recurrent rounds of transcriptional modulation events in the IC in order to consolidate this memory trace, demonstrating that transcriptional and epigenetic modulation substantially contribute to memory-consolidation-related functions performed by a neocortical area even several hours after memory acquisition.'
30219247	2018	"""New discoveries providing insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics, their dynamic interactions as well as their role in cellular homeostasis have dramatically advanced our understanding of the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease (PD). Respiratory chain impairment is a key feature in sporadic PD patients and there is growing evidence that links proteins encoded by PD-associated genes to disturbances in mitochondrial function. Against the backdrop of latest advances in the development of PD treatments that target mitochondria, we aim to give an overview of the literature published in the last three decades on the significance of mitochondria in the pathogenesis of PD. We describe the contribution of mitochondrial genome alterations and PD-associated genes to mitochondrial maintenance. We highlight mitophagy as a key mechanism in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we focus on the reciprocal interaction between alpha-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We discuss a novel trafficking pathway involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles within the context of PD and provide a synopsis of the most recently emerging topics in PD research with respect to mitochondria. This includes the relationship between mitochondria and cell-mediated immunity, the ER-mitochondria axis, sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial stress response and the role of micro RNAs in the aetiology of PD. In addition, recent studies have challenged the neuro-centric view of PD pathology, moving microglia and astrocytes into the research spotlight. Greater insights into these mechanisms may hold the key for the development of novel targeted therapies, addressing the need for a disease-modifying treatment, which has remained elusive to date."""
30219234	2018	'β/γ-Crystallins are predominant structural proteins in vertebrate lens with unique properties of extremely high solubility, long-term stability and resistance to UV damage. Four conserved Trp residues in β/γ-crystallins account for UV absorbance and thereafter fluorescence quenching to avoid photodamage. Herein we found that βB2-crystallin Trp fluorescence was greatly enhanced by the introduction of an extra unquenched Trp fluorophore by cataract-associated mutations S31W and R145W. Both mutations impaired oligomerization, decreased stability and promote thermal aggregation, while S31W was more deleterious. S31W accelerated βB2-crystallin aggregation under UV damaging conditions, whereas R145W delayed. These observations suggested that the introduction of an extra Trp fluorophore had complicated effects on βB2-crystallin stability and aggregation against various stresses. Our findings highlight that the number of Trp fluorophores in β/γ-crystallin is evolutionarily optimized to exquisitely perform their structural roles in the lens.'
30219232	2018	'The aim of the present study is to investigate the expression and function of miR-613 in colon cancer (CC) and illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-613-regulated CC progression. Our data demonstrated that miR-613 was upregulated in CC tissue samples (P\u202f=\u202f0.009) and human CC cell lines (HCT-116 and Lovo; P\u202f=\u202f0.001 and P\u202f=\u202f0.003, respectively), which also promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of CC cells (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Atonal homolog1 (ATOH1) was the target mRNA of miR-613. Rescue experiments showed that ATOH1 overexpression vector significantly reversed the stimulative effects of miR-613 mimic on the progression of HCT-116 and Lovo cells (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Positive ATOH1 expression in CC tissues was significantly associated with lower grade (χ\u202f=\u202f3.592, P\u202f=\u202f0.043), lower TNM stage (χ\u202f=\u202f3.537, P\u202f=\u202f0.048) and better overall survival (P=0.041). Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) pathway and Mucin 2 (MUC2) were the potential downstream proteins of miR-613/ATOH1. miR-613 is an oncogene in CC and promotes the proliferation, invasion and migration of CC cells by targeting ATOH1 likely via activating JNK1 pathway and upregulating MUC2.'

However, whether necroptosis is involved in RA articular cartilage damage processes remain unclear. The aim of present study was to investigate the dynamic changes in arthritic chondrocyte necroptosis and the effect of RIP1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) inhibitor amiloride on arthritic cartilage injury and acid-induced chondrocyte necroptosis. Our results demonstrated that the expression of RIP1, RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein phosphorylation (p-MLKL) were increased in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat articular cartilage in\xa0vivo and acid-induced chondrocytes in\xa0vitro. High co-expression of ASIC1a and RIP1 showed in AA rat articular cartilage. Moreover, Nec-1 and amiloride could reduce articular cartilage damage and necroinflammation in AA rats. In addition, acid-induced increase in necroptosis markers RIP1/RIP3 were inhibited by Nec-1, ASIC1a-specific blocker psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx-1) or ASIC1a-short hairpin RNA respectively, which revealed that necroptosis is triggered in acid-induced chondrocytes and mediated by ASIC1a. These findings indicated that blocking ASIC1a-mediated chondrocyte necroptosis may provide potential therapeutic strategies for RA treatment.'
30219206	2018	'We have a large body of evidence showing that hyperglycemia is a cardiovascular risk factor and that its reduction decreases the risk for cardiovascular events. Indeed, epidemiological studies have clearly shown that hyperglycemia is a strong and independent factor for cardiovascular disease. In addition, we have many pathophysiological studies demonstrating the direct role of hyperglycemia in the development of atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia, by stimulating protein kinase C, increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, of adhesion molecules and of endothelin-1 and, by stimulating the polyol pathway, promotes the oxidative stress. Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia leads to the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products that modify the structure of the arterial wall and, as a consequence, will increase the risk for the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, prolonged intervention studies have shown that reduction of hyperglycemia is associated with a significant decrease in the risk for major cardiovascular events. Thus, hyperglycemia is a cardiovascular risk factor which is characterized by the fact that it induces profound modifications of the arterial wall and that it is necessary to correct hyperglycemia during enough time to obtain a cardiovascular benefit.'

Genetic testing for sequence changes in BRCA1 frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on cancer risk and on the molecular function of BRCA1 is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for the homology-directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a critical activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here, we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay for concurrently measuring the effects of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 for their role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we characterized the effects of 1,056 amino acid substitutions in the first 192 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects on DNA repair function or on cancer predisposition, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign missense variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.'
30219159	2018	'BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the interactions between silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in intraplaque angiogenesis and their potential mechanisms through in vivo and in vitro studies.\n\nMETHODS: An atherosclerosis model was established in 12 rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. The rabbits were equally divided into 3 groups: a control group (high-lipid diet), RAP group (high-lipid diet supplemented with rapamycin) and RAP + NAM group (high-lipid diet supplemented with rapamycin and nicotinamide). At the end of 4 weeks, the area of plaques in the aorta was determined and the protein expression of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected through hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. For in vitro study, a hypoxia model was established in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by using the chemical method (CoCl). The MTT assay, scratch assay and tube formation assay were performed to evaluate the proliferation and angiogenesis abilities of HUVECs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of SIRT1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), mTOR and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K). Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of SIRT1, HIF-1α, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-raptor and p-p70S6K.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the in vivo study indicated a significant inhibitory effect of rapamycin on plaque size and intraplaque angiogenesis (0.05 ± 0.02mm versus 5.44 ± 0.50mm, P < 0.05). This effect was attenuated by nicotinamide (0.76 ± 0.15mm versus 0.05 ± 0.02mm, P < 0.05). Compared with the RAP group, CD31- and VEGF-positive vessels were abundant in the RAP + NAM group. The RAP group showed lower expression of p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and HIF-1α than did the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the RAP + NAM group showed slightly higher expression of these factors than did the RAP group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the angiogenic ability of HUVECs and its significant inhibitory effects on the protein level of HIF-1α and the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the mTORC1 pathway, including mTOR, raptor and p70S6K (P < 0.05), were enhanced by cotreatment with SRT1720 and rapamycin (P < 0.05). In contrast to mTOR and SIRT1, the mRNA levels of p70S6K and HIF-1α were reduced by rapamycin (P < 0.05) and further reduced by cotreatment with SRT1720 and rapamycin.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate that SIRT1 might negatively regulate atherosclerotic angiogenesis via mTORC1 and HIF-1α signaling pathway and cointervention of SIRT1 and mTOR may serve as a crucial therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular medicine.'

Here, we explored the combined genetic effects of coding and noncoding variants in CFH, rs6677604 and rs800292 on complement activation in IgAN.\n\nMETHODS: In total, 1,194 IgAN patients and 900 healthy controls who were the same as the Beijing Discovery Cohort in our recent IgAN-GWAS were recruited. The genotyping information of rs800292 and rs6677604 were extracted from GWAS data, while the information regarding plasma C3 levels and mesangial C3 deposits were collected from medical records.\n\nRESULTS: We found both rs800292-GG and rs6677604-GG were risk genotypes for complement activation in IgAN patients, as represented by lower plasma C3 levels in IgAN patients with rs800292-GG and a higher intensity of glomerular C3 deposits in those with rs6677604-GG, respectively. Additionally, IgAN patients with 2 risk genotypes (rs800292-GG and rs6677604-GG) showed a higher degree of complement activation compared to those with no risk genotypes (rs800292-AA/AG and rs6677604-AA/AG), as represented by both lower plasma C3 levels and a higher intensity of glomerular C3 deposits. Moreover, when compared to rs800292 or rs6677604 alone, the combined genetic effects of rs800292 and rs6677604 showed a stronger association with IgAN susceptibility.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that both coding and noncoding variants in CFH acted synergistically to regulate the degree of complement activation and thereby contributed to IgAN susceptibility.'
30219115	2018	'BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy is a striking example of the multiple changes in the physiological state of humans and animals induced by microgravity. Previous studies have shown that a blood circulation disorder may be a cause of this atrophy, and traditional Chinese medicine has been regarded as a potential countermeasure to reverse the atrophy in China. This study was carried out to test the effects of Xuefuzhuyu capsules (XFZY) on the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by simulated microgravity.\n\nMETHODS: The mass and cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle were compared in rats treated with XFZY that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (XFZY-TS group), untreated rats that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (TS group), and control rats (CON group). The expression and phosphorylation levels of key proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system were also measured.\n\nRESULTS: Treatment with XFZY attenuated the loss of muscle mass and cross-sectional area induced by hindlimb unloading. Western blot analysis showed that the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase/phospho-Akt (PI3K/p-Akt) pathways were down-regulated after 30 d in the TS group compared with the CON group. This effect was partly reversed by XFZY. Hindlimb unloading increased the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Caspase 12. Treatment with XFZY alleviated this increased protein expression.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our results suggest that XFZY could partially reverse the effects of hindlimb unloading on muscle atrophy and perhaps target the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system, possibly through the GRP78-CHOP-JNK-Caspase 12 pathway.Zhang S, Yuan M, Cheng C, Xia D, Wu S.

30219099	2018	'BACKGROUND: The formation of intrafusal muscle (IM) fibers and their contact with afferent proprioceptive axons is critical for construction, function, and maintenance of the stretch reflex. Many factors affect the formation of IM fibers. Finding new factors and mechanisms of IM fiber formation is essential for the reconstruction of stretch reflex arc after injury.\n\nMETHODS: We established a coculture system of organotypic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and dissociated skeletal muscle (SKM) cells. The formation of IM fibers was observed in this coculture system after neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) incubation.\n\nRESULTS: We found that NRG-1β promoted outgrowth of neurites and migration of neurons from the organotypic DRG explants and that this correlated with an induction of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression. NRG-1β also increased the amount of nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers by elevating the proportion of tyrosine kinase receptor C (TrkC) phenotypic DRG neurons. In addition, we found that the effects of NRG-1β could be blocked by inhibiting ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.\n\nCONCLUSION: These data imply that NRG-1β promoted neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration from the organotypic DRG explants and that this correlated with an induction of GAP-43 expression. The modulating effects of NRG-1β on TrkC DRG neuronal phenotype may link to promote IM fiber formation. The effects produced by NRG-1β in this neuromuscular coculture system provide new data for the therapeutic potential on IM fiber formation after muscle injury.'
30219098	2018	'BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms can contribute to phenotypic differences amongst individuals, including disease risk and drug response. Characterization of genetic polymorphisms that modulate gene expression and/or protein function may facilitate the identification of the causal variants. Here, we present the architecture of genetic polymorphisms in the human genome focusing on those predicted to be potentially functional/under natural selection and the pathways that they reside.\n\nRESULTS: In the human genome, polymorphisms that directly affect protein sequences and potentially affect function are the most constrained variants with the lowest single-nucleotide variant (SNV) density, least population differentiation and most significant enrichment of rare alleles. SNVs which potentially alter various regulatory sites, e.g. splicing regulatory elements, are also generally under negative selection. Interestingly, genes that regulate the expression of transcription/splicing factors and histones are conserved as a higher proportion of these genes is non-polymorphic, contain ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and/or has no non-synonymous SNVs (nsSNVs)/coding INDELs. On the other hand, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are the most polymorphic with SNVs potentially affecting the binding of transcription/splicing factors and microRNAs (miRNA) exhibiting recent positive selection (RPS). The drug transporter genes carry the most number of potentially deleterious nsSNVs and exhibit signatures of RPS and/or population differentiation. These observations suggest that genes that interact with the environment are highly polymorphic and targeted by RPS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, selective constraints are observed in coding regions, master regulator genes, and potentially functional SNVs. In contrast, genes that modulate response to the environment are highly polymorphic and under positive selection.'
30219084	2018	'BACKGROUND: Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue (CCSST) and clear cell sarcoma-like gastrointestinal tumor (CCSLGT) are malignant mesenchymal tumors that share some pathological features, but they also have several different characteristics. They are well known to express chimeric fusions of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) family members; namely, EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and EWSR1-CREB1. In addition, recent studies have suggested the presence of other fusions.\n\nMETHODS: We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect specific rearrangements including EWSR1, ATF1, CREB1, and cAMP response element modulator (CREM) in 16 CCSST and 6 CCSLGT cases. We also used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific chimeric fusions of EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 using fresh tumor samples in available cases.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 15 of 16 CCSST cases (93.8%) had EWSR1 rearrangement, of which 11 (68.8%) also had ATF1 rearrangement, suggestive of the presence of EWSR1-ATF1 fusions. One CCSST case (6.3%) was found to have EWSR1 and CREM rearrangements, and 4 of 6 CCSLGT cases (66.7%) had EWSR1 rearrangement, of which 2 (33.3%) showed ATF1 rearrangement and the other 2 cases (33.3%) showed CREB1 rearrangement. These cases most likely had EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 fusions, respectively. RT-PCR was performed in 8 available cases, including 6 CCSSTs and 2 CCSLGTs. All CCSSTs showed EWSR1-ATF1 fusions. Among the 2 CCSLGT cases, one had EWSR1-ATF1 fusion and the other had EWSR1-CREB1 fusion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Rearrangements of EWSR1 and ATF1 or EWSR1-ATF1 fusion were predominantly found in CCSST, whereas those of EWSR1 and CREB1 or EWSR1-CREB1 tended to be detected in CCSLGT. A novel CREM fusion was also detected in a few cases of CCSST and CCSLGT. The cases in which EWSR1 rearrangement was detected without definitive partner genes should be considered for the presence of CREM rearrangement.'
30219082	2018	'BACKGROUND: Chromium histidinate (CrHis) and biotin are micronutrients commonly used to improve health by athletes and control glycaemia by patients with diabetes. This study investigates the effects of 8-week regular exercise training in rats together with dietary CrHis and biotin supplementation on glucose, lipids and transaminases levels, as well as protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB).\n\nMETHODS: A total of 56 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 groups of 7 animals each and treated as follows: Control, CrHis, Biotin, CrHis+Biotin, Exercise, CrHis+Exercise, Biotin+Exercise, and CrHis+Biotin+Exercise. The doses of CrHis and biotin were 400\xa0μg/kg and 6\xa0mg/kg of diet, respectively. The training program consisted of running at 30\xa0m/min for 30\xa0min/day at 0% grade level, 5\xa0days per week, once a day for 6\xa0weeks. Serum glucose, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured with an automatic biochemical analyzer. Muscle and liver PPAR-γ, IRS-1 and NF-κB expressions were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction.\n\nRESULTS: Regular exercise significantly (p\xa0<\u20090.001) decreased glucose, TC and TG levels, but increased HDL cholesterol. Dietary CrHis and biotin supplementation exhibited a significant (p\xa0<\u20090.001) decrease in glucose (effect size\u2009=\u2009large; ƞ2\u2009=\xa00.773) and TG (effect size\u2009=\u2009large; ƞ2\u2009=\u20090.802) levels, and increase in HDL cholesterol compared with the exercise group. No significant change in AST and ALT (effect size\u2009=\u2009none) levels was recorded in all groups (p\xa0>\u20090.05). CrHis/biotin improves the proteins expression levels of IRS-1, PPAR-γ, and NF-κB (effect size: large for all) in the liver and muscle of sedentary and regular exercise-trained rats (p\xa0<\u20090.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CrHis/biotin supplementation improved serum glucose and lipid levels as well as proteins expression levels of PPAR-γ, IRS-1 and NF-κB in the liver and muscle of exercise-trained rats, with the highest efficiency when administered together. CrHis/biotin may represent an effective nutritional therapy to improve health.'
30219077	2018	'BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Asia; however, the molecular mechanism in its tumorigenesis remains unclear. Abnormal expression of claudins (CLDNs), a family of tight junction (TJ) proteins, plays an important role in the metastatic phenotype of epithelial-derived tumors by affecting tight junction structure, function and related cellular signaling pathways. In a previous study, we used a tissue chip assay to identify CLDN17 as an upregulated gene in HCC. Here we aimed to use molecular biology technology to explore the effect of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HCC and the underlying molecular mechanism, with the objective of identifying a new target for HCC treatment and the control of HCC metastasis.\n\nMETHOD: The expression levels of CLDN17 in HCC tissues and histologically non-neoplastic hepatic tissues were explored by immunohistochemistry. Stable transfection of the hepatocyte line HL7702 with CLDN17 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of CLDN17 on the malignant phenotype of HL7702 cells in vitro was assessed by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, a Transwell assay and a wound-healing experiment. Western blotting was utilized to detect the activation state of Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) / signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) pathway. A Tyk2 RNA interference (RNAi) was utilized to determine the impact of the Tyk2/Stat3 signaling pathway on the malignant phenotype of hepatocytes.\n\nRESULTS: In this work, our research group first found that CLDN17 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, we demonstrated that CLDN17 affected the Stat3 signaling pathway via Tyk2 and ultimately enhanced the migration ability of hepatocytes.\n\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, we confirmed that the upregulated expression of CLDN17 significantly enhances the migration ability of hepatocytes in vitro and we found that the activation of the Stat3 pathway by Tyk2 may an important mechanism by which CLDN17 promotes aggressiveness in hepatocytes.'
30219064	2018	'BACKGROUND: In this research, we aimed to investigate the biological functions of LIM domain only 3 (LMO3) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and uncover the underlying molecular mechanism in it.\n\nMETHODS: HCC tissue microarray (n\u2009=\u2009180) was used to analyze the correlation between LMO3 expression and clinicopathological findings. In vitro transwell matrigel invasion assay and annexin V anoikis assay in HCC cells were conducted to investigate LMO3 related biological functions. In vivo intrahepatic and lung metastasis models were used to determine the role of LMO3 in HCC metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were performed to investigate the expression and mechanism of LMO3 in HCC.\n\nRESULTS: We found that the expression of LMO3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, and it was closely related to clinicopathological findings and patient prognoses. Knockdown of LMO3 suppressed the invasion and anoikis inhibition of HCC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, the metastasis of SMMC-7721 cells was also suppressed by LMO3 knockdown in vivo. Furthermore, we found that LMO3 knockdown increased the phosphorylation of YAP and LATS1, and decrease Rho GTPases activities. LMO3 directly interacted with LATS1, and thus suppressed Hippo signaling. Recombinant LMO3 (rLMO3) protein administration decreased the phosphorylation of YAP and LATS1, and increased Rho GTPases activities. The inhibitors of the Hippo pathway abrogated rLMO3 protein-induced HCC cell invasion and anoikis inhibition.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LMO3 promotes HCC cell invasion and anoikis inhibition by interacting with LATS1 and suppressing Hippo signaling. LMO3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC in future.'
30219059	2018	'BACKGROUND: Upon ingestion, nanoparticles can interact with the intestinal epithelial barrier potentially resulting in systemic uptake of nanoparticles. Nanoparticle properties have been described to influence the protein corona formation and subsequent cellular adhesion, uptake and transport. Here, we aimed to study the effects of nanoparticle size and surface chemistry on the protein corona formation and subsequent cellular adhesion, uptake and transport. Caco-2 intestinal cells, were exposed to negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) (50 and 200\xa0nm), functionalized with sulfone or carboxyl groups, at nine nominal concentrations (15-250\xa0μg/ml) for 10 up to 120\xa0min. The protein coronas were analysed by LC-MS/MS.\n\nRESULTS: Subtle differences in the protein composition of the two PSNPs with different surface chemistry were noted. High-content imaging analysis demonstrated that sulfone PSNPs were associated with the cells to a significantly higher extent than the other PSNPs. The apparent cellular adhesion and uptake of 200\xa0nm PSNPs was not significantly increased compared to 50\xa0nm PSNPs with the same surface charge and chemistry. Surface chemistry outweighs the impact of size on the observed PSNP cellular associations. Also transport of the sulfone PSNPs through the monolayer of cells was significantly higher than that of carboxyl PSNPs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the composition of the protein corona and the PSNP surface chemistry influences cellular adhesion, uptake and monolayer transport, which might be predictive of the intestinal transport potency of NPs.'
30219058	2018	'BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease. Repetitive injury and reprogramming of the lung epithelium are thought to be critical drivers of disease progression, contributing to fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and subsequently loss of lung architecture and function. To date, Pirfenidone and Nintedanib are the only approved drugs known to decelerate disease progression, however, if and how these drugs affect lung epithelial cell function, remains largely unexplored.\n\nMETHODS: We treated murine and human 3D ex vivo lung tissue cultures (3D-LTCs; generated from precision cut lung slices (PCLS)) as well as primary murine alveolar epithelial type II (pmATII) cells with Pirfenidone or Nintedanib. Murine 3D-LTCs or pmATII cells were derived from the bleomycin model of fibrosis. Early fibrotic changes were induced in human 3D-LTCs by a mixture of profibrotic factors. Epithelial and mesenchymal cell function was determined by qPCR, Western blotting, Immunofluorescent staining, and ELISA.\n\nRESULTS: Low μM concentrations of Nintedanib (1\xa0μM) and mM concentrations of Pirfenidone (2.5\xa0mM) reduced fibrotic gene expression including Collagen 1a1 and Fibronectin in murine and human 3D-LTCs as well as pmATII cells. Notably, Nintedanib stabilized expression of distal lung epithelial cell markers, especially Surfactant Protein C in pmATII cells as well as in murine and human 3D-LTCs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone and Nintedanib exhibit distinct effects on murine and human epithelial cells, which might contribute to their anti-fibrotic action. Human 3D-LTCs represent a valuable tool to assess anti-fibrotic mechanisms of potential drugs for the treatment of IPF patients.'
30219048	2018	"'BACKGROUND: Dramatic progress has recently been made in cryo-electron microscopy technologies, which now make possible the reconstruction of a growing number of biomolecular structures to near-atomic resolution. However, the need persists for fitting and refinement approaches that address those cases that require modeling assistance.\n\nMETHODS: In this paper, we describe algorithms to optimize the performance of such medium-resolution refinement methods. These algorithms aim to automatically optimize the parameters that define the density shape of the flexibly fitted model, as well as the time-dependent damper cutoff distance. Atomic distance constraints can be prescribed for cases where extra containment of parts of the structure is helpful, such as in regions where the density map is poorly defined. Also, we propose a simple stopping criterion that estimates the probable onset of overfitting during the simulation.\n\nRESULTS: The new set of algorithms produce more accurate fitting and refinement results, and yield a faster rate of convergence of the trajectory toward the fitted conformation. The latter is also more reliable due to the overfitting warning provided to the user.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The algorithms described here were implemented in the new Damped-Dynamics Flexible Fitting simulation tool ""DDforge"" in the Situs package.'"

Although pseudogenes lost the ability to produce protein, it still exert import biological function, and play important role in the pathogenesis of a wide varity of tumors; However, the role of pseudogenes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is poorly understood.\n\nMETHODS: TUSC2P function in ESCC were explored using both in vitro and in vivo experiments cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis assay was performed to evaluated the effect of TUSC2P on the tumor biology of ESCC. Expression of relative genes was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting in EC109 and TE-1 cell, as well as ESCC patients. 3'UTR luciferase assay was used to confirm the direct binding of miRNAs with TUSC2 and TUSC2P 3'UTR. Relation betweenTUSC2P, TUSC2 and ESCC prognosis was predicted by survival analysis (n\u2009=\u200956).\n\nRESULTS: Pseudogene TUSC2P was down regulated in ESCC tissues compared with paired normal adjacent tissues, and the expression of TUSC2P was significantly correlated with survivalof ESCC patients. Over expression of TUSC2P in EC109 and TE-1 cells resulted in altered expression of TUSC2, thus inhibited proliferation, invasion and promoted apoptosis. Dual luciferase assay demonstrated that TUSC2P 3'UTR decoyed miR-17-5p, miR-520a-3p, miR-608, miR-661 from binding to TUSC2.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TUSC2P can suppresses the tumor function of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating TUSC2 expression and may also serve as a prognostic factor for ESCC patients."""
30219026	2018	'BACKGROUND: Spanins are phage lysis proteins required to disrupt the outer membrane. Phages employ either two-component spanins or unimolecular spanins in this final step of Gram-negative host lysis. Two-component spanins like Rz-Rz1 from phage lambda consist of an integral inner membrane protein: i-spanin, and an outer membrane lipoprotein: o-spanin, that form a complex spanning the periplasm. Two-component spanins exist in three different genetic architectures; embedded, overlapped and separated. In contrast, the unimolecular spanins, like gp11 from phage T1, have an N-terminal lipoylation signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane domain to account for the topology requirements. Our proposed model for spanin function, for both spanin types, follows a common theme of the outer membrane getting fused with the inner membrane, effecting the release of progeny virions.\n\nRESULTS: Here we present a SpaninDataBase which consists of 528 two-component spanins and 58 unimolecular spanins identified in this analysis. Primary analysis revealed significant differences in the secondary structure predictions for the periplasmic domains of the two-component and unimolecular spanin types, as well as within the three different genetic architectures of the two-component spanins. Using a threshold of 40% sequence identity over 40% sequence length, we were able to group the spanins into 143 i-spanin, 125 o-spanin and 13 u-spanin families. More than 40% of these families from each type were singletons, underlining the extreme diversity of this class of lysis proteins. Multiple sequence alignments of periplasmic domains demonstrated conserved secondary structure patterns and domain organization within family members. Furthermore, analysis of families with members from different architecture allowed us to interpret the evolutionary dynamics of spanin gene arrangement. Also, the potential universal role of intermolecular disulfide bonds in two-component spanin function was substantiated through bioinformatic and genetic approaches. Additionally, a novel lipobox motif, AWAC, was identified and experimentally verified.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings from this bioinformatic approach gave us instructive insights into spanin function, evolution, domain organization and provide a platform for future spanin annotation, as well as biochemical and genetic experiments. They also establish that spanins, like viral membrane fusion proteins, adopt different strategies to achieve fusion of the inner and outer membranes.'
30218980	2018	'Iron deficiency is routinely treated with oral or systemic iron supplements, which are highly reactive and could induce oxidative stress via augmenting the activity of proinflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO). To investigate the extent to which MPO is involved in iron-induced toxicity, acute (24 h) iron toxicity was induced by intraperitoneal administration of FeSO (25 mg/kg body weight) to MPO-deficient (MpoKO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Acute iron toxicity was also assessed in WT mice pretreated with an MPO inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide. Systemic iron administration up-regulated circulating MPO and neutrophil elastase and elevated systemic inflammatory and organ damage markers in WT mice. However, genetic deletion of MPO or its inhibition significantly reduced iron-induced organ damage and systemic inflammatory responses. In contrast to the acute model, 8 weeks of 2% carbonyl iron diet feeding to WT mice did not change the levels of circulating MPO and neutrophil elastase but promoted their accumulation in the liver. Even though both MpoKO and WT mice displayed similar levels of diet-induced hyperferremia, MpoKO mice showed significantly reduced inflammatory response and oxidative stress than the WT mice. In addition, WT bone-marrow-derived neutrophils (BMDN) generated more reactive oxygen species than MPO-deficient BMDN upon iron stimulation. Altogether, genetic deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of MPO substantially attenuated acute and chronic iron-induced toxicity. Our results suggest that targeting MPO during iron supplementation is a promising approach to reduce iron-induced toxicity/side effects in vulnerable population.'
30218979	2018	"'We aimed to investigate the effect of linoleic acid (LA) treatment on the blood pressure and function of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR were treated daily with LA (15 mg/kg) or vehicle (control) for 15 days. Compared with controls, LA treatment decreased blood pressure and showed the following in MRA: (1) increased lumen and external diameter, (2) decreased wall:lumen ratio and wall thickness, (3) decreased stiffness and (4) less collagen deposition. LA treatment reduced the contractile response to phenylephrine, although there were no changes observed in MRA in regard to the acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside responses. Incubation with L-NAME left-shifted the reactivity to phenylephrine only in the MRA treated group, suggesting that LA treatment can improve NO bioavailability. This result was accompanied by an increase ""in situ"" NO production. Incubation with tiron decreased vascular reactivity to phenylephrine in MRA in LA rats, which was accompanied by decreased superoxide anion production. Moreover, incubation with indomethacin (non-selective COX inhibitor, 10 μM), NS 398 (COX-2 specific inhibitor, 1 μM), furegrelate (TXA synthase inhibitor, 1 μM), SQ 29.548 (TP receptor antagonist, 1 μM) and SC 19220 (EP1 receptor antagonist, 10 μM) reduced the vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in MRA in the treated group. These results were accompanied by a reduction in COX-2 protein expression. In conclusion, these findings show that LA treatment decreases blood pressure. In addition, the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and structural changes in this hypertension model may be responsible for the reduction in blood pressure.'"
30218965	2018	'Wide use of AlO nanoparticles (NPs) leading to their possible escape into environment and their interaction with living organisms demands immediate attention. We evaluated impact of nanoparticulate (AlO-NPs) and ionic (Al) forms of aluminium on early seedling growth of Vigna radiata. While Al inhibited growth of seedlings, AlO-NPs did not affect it negatively. Unlike enhancement in proline, malondialdehyde and HO levels in roots and shoots induced by Al, these stress markers remained unaltered by AlO-NPs. No signs of membrane damage were recorded in roots of seedlings raised in presence of AlO-NPs; this was witnessed from insignificant electrolyte leakage and Evans blue uptake. Activities of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismustase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase in root and shoot were enhanced by Al. However, they were unaffected by AlO-NPs. Al enhanced levels of non-protein thiols, phenolics and ascorbate, with no alterations induced by AlO-NPs. These findings revealed that, AlO-NPs did not induce oxidative stress in seedlings. Seedlings raised in Al showed higher uptake of Al than those grown in AlO-NPs; Al content was higher in roots. Al was not detected in shoots of seedlings grown in AlO-NPs. Lower translocation of Al in seedlings raised in AlO-NPs was due to adsorption/restriction of AlO-NPs on root surface. Al caused ruptures on root epidermis of seedlings and inhibited root-hair formation, whereas no structural damage was caused by AlO-NPs. Our findings revealed that while ionic Al is highly toxic, nanoparticulate form of Al is non-toxic to growth of V. radiata.'
30218961	2018	'Bisphenol F (BPF) is a substitute of bisphenol A in the production of epoxy resin and polycarbonate. Its extensive use in consumer products leads to a wide human exposure at high levels. Although the adverse effects of BPF on animal health are of increasing public concern, its risks on systematic glucose metabolism and blood glucose concentrations still remain largely unknown. Using zebrafish larvae as the model animal, we investigated the disturbance of BPF exposure on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish larvae at 96\u202fh post fertilization were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100\u202fμg/L of BPF for 48\u202fh. Compared with the control group, glucose levels of larvae increased significantly in the 10 and 100\u202fμg/L exposure groups, which are associated with enhancement of gluconeogenesis and suppression of glycolysis induced by high doses of BPF. Additionally, both mRNA expressions and protein levels of insulin increased significantly in the 10 and 100\u202fμg/L exposure groups, while transcription levels of genes encoding insulin receptor substrates decreased significantly in these groups, indicating a possibly decreased insulin sensitivity due to impairment of insulin signaling transduction downstream of insulin receptor. Further, compared with BPF alone, co-exposure of larvae to BPF and rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, significantly attenuates increases in both glucose levels and mRNA expressions of a key gluconeogenesis enzyme. Our data therefore indicate impairing insulin signaling transduction may be the main mechanism through which BPF disrupts glucose metabolism and induces hyperglycemia. Results of the present study inform the health risk assessment of BPF and also suggest the use of zebrafish larvae in large-scale screening of chemicals with possible glucose metabolism disturbing effect.'
30218952	2018	'BACKGROUND: Inflammation, oxidative stress and epithelial barrier dysfunction have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathology. The targeted inhibition of these features may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for IBD. Polydatin is an effective natural antioxidant that possesses strong antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. Thus, we studied the protective effects of polydatin treatments on a mouse model of experimental colitis.\n\nMETHODS: Acute colitis was experimentally induced by adding 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to the drinking water provided to mice for 7\u202fdays and by administering different doses of polydatin (15, 30, or 45\u202fmg/kg) during the same period. Mice were also treated with the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway inhibitor cyclopamine to estimate the efficacy of polydatin and Shh inhibitors on colitis. The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histology, levels of oxidative and apoptotic mediators and levels of Shh pathway components were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: The polydatin treatment significantly attenuated the DAI, colon shortening and histological damage. In addition, polydatin administration effectively decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Polydatin also inhibited apoptosis in mice with colitis by downregulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, polydatin modulated Shh signaling pathway activation. After polydatin treatment, the main components of the Shh pathway, including Shh, Patched (Ptc), Smoothened (Smo), and glioblastoma-1 (Gli1), were upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Blockade of the Shh pathway using cyclopamine abolished the effects of polydatin on mice with colitis.\n\nCONCLUSION: Based on these observations, polydatin may suppress experimental colitis at least partially by regulating the Shh signaling pathway.'

Result represented that NH-N and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were high of 99.1% and 94.3% in the SBF-MBR. Protein (PN) contents from SND-biofilm were reduced by 10.5% and 44.3% in TB-EPS and LB-EPS, while polysaccharides (PS) were reduced by 45.8% and 34.8%, respectively. 3D-EEM spectra indicated that protein-like, humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances were the main components in EPS and their peak intensities were reduced. Additionally, membrane fouling of SBF-MBR was improved after the achievement of biofilm. Microbial community analysis showed that Simplicispira, Thauera, Desulfovibrio, Dechlorobacter and Acinetobacter were dominant genus, which indicated co-existence of nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers in the SBF-MBR.'
30218928	2018	"""BACKGROUND/AIM: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncovirus that is commonly associated with the development of lymphomas and epithelial carcinomas. In the era of immunotherapy, histological evaluation of EBV-related cancers is currently a multi-sample, multi-technique process requiring separate time-consuming detection of EBV-encoded small RNAs by in situ hybridisation (ISH), and parallel labelling of sections for cancer-associated protein markers.\n\nMETHODS: Using EBV-associated tumours as proof-of-concept for feasibility, here we developed an approach that allows simultaneous detection of EBV RNAs and multiple protein markers such as PD-L1, EBV-LMP, CD8, CD4, CD20, CD30 and CD15on a single tissue section based on our recently reported automated staining protocol.\n\nRESULTS: We successfully combined multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to detect 3 abovementioned protein markers involved in cancer, with ISH, and applied the protocol to f tissue samples from patients diagnosed with EBV-associated pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC), gastric carcinoma and Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Empowered by the Vectra 3 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, we demonstrate the utility and potential of this integrated approach to concurrently detect and quantitate viral RNA and protein biomarkers of immune and tumour cells.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study represents an important step forward in the research and diagnosis of EBV-associated cancers, and could be readily modified to include other proteins and RNA markers to apply to other malignancies. More importantly, the novel automated ISH-mIF protocol that we detailly described here could also be readily reproduced by most of the diagnostic and research lab to future projects that aim to look at both RNA and protein markers."""
30218926	2018	'Anodic electroactive biofilms (EABs) need to overcome low current densities for applications such as microbial fuel cells or biosensors. EABs can store charge in self-produced redox proteins when temporarily left in open circuit, and discharge them once the electrode is appropriately repolarized, thus behaving as pseudocapacitors. Here we investigated the effect of such periodic polarization on the intrinsic nature of the EABs during their entire growth (i.e. starting from inoculation and for 10 days) on glassy carbon electrodes. An optimal periodic polarization (half-period of 10\u202fs) greatly increased the maximum steady-state current density delivered by the Geobacter-dominated EABs (up to 1.10\u202f±\u202f0.02\u202fmA\u202fcm, n\u202f=\u202f3 electrodes) when compared to continuously polarized EABs (0.41\u202f±\u202f0.04\u202fmA\u202fcm); and increased the amount of electric charges produced per hour by 69\u202f±\u202f17% even taking into account the half-periods of open circuit. This enhancement was highly correlated with a substantial increase in charge carriers concentration (10.6\u202f±\u202f0.5\u202fmM vs. 2.9\u202f±\u202f0.6\u202fmM), allowing higher charge storage capacity and higher electron mobility across the EABs. Our results suggest that appropriate periodic polarizations may upregulate the expression of heme-containing redox proteins associated with the matrix, such as c-type cytochromes. The EABs grown under periodic polarization presented mushroom-like structures on their top layers, while EABs grown under continuous polarization were flat.'

They usually have a childhood onset and rapidly progressive course with loss of ability to walk over 12-16\u202fyears.\n\nMETHODS: Next generation sequencing (NGS) targeted gene panel was performed in three adult patients with progressive muscle weakness in which routine muscle histology and immunohistochemistry were not diagnostic.\n\nRESULTS: Genetic analysis revealed homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in SGCA gene and Western Blot demonstrated protein reduction confirming the diagnosis of α-sarcoglicanopathy.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our cases evidence that the diagnosis of mild forms of alfa sarcoglicanopathy could be a challenge and suggest the possibility that they could be underdiagnosed. The use of Next generation Sequencing targeted gene panels is very helpful in the diagnosis of these patients.'

Dugs' plasma levels were followed for 12 or 72\u202fh post dosing for CIP and TIN, respectively, and different PK data for the two drugs were calculated and they were comparable to the reported values demonstrating successful future application of the presented method in PK, bioequivalence and bioavailability studies."""
30218917	2018	'BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type 1, a deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, causes an accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3-HGA). Testing of these analytes is routinely done by GC-MS but seldom account for interference from isomers or compounds with similar ion transitions. We developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method that accurately measures 3-HGA in urine and plasma specimens, while utilizing similar reagents and instrumentation used for the routine performance of amino acid and acylcarnitine analysis in determining the diagnosis of several metabolic disorders.\n\nMETHOD: Plasma and urine samples were added aliquots of the deuterated 3-HGA internal standard and acetonitrile. The protein-free supernatant was brought to dryness, and the residue derivatized using 3\u202fM HCL in 1-butanol with heating. The dried derivative was then reconstituted in 50% methanol-water solution and aliquot transferred to an HPLC vial for analysis by LC-MS/MS. Separation was performed using a C8 HPLC column under flow gradient conditions of 0.2% formic acid in water and methanol, respectively. Ionization was by ESI and detection of selected precursor-product ion transitions by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode.\n\nRESULTS: The butyl-ester derivative of 3-HGA eluted at 7.82\u202fmin while 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HGA) eluted at 8.21\u202fmin. This was equivalent to a separation factor of 1.05 and a resolution of 1.03, respectively. The 3-HGA calibration curve was linear over the range 6.20-319\u202fng\u202fmL (r\u202f=\u202f0.9996), and the reportable range determined by the linearity was found to be 1.54-384\u202fng\u202fmL. The calculated limits of detection and quantitation were 0.348 and 1.56\u202fng\u202fmL, respectively. Intra- and Inter-assay %CVs for quality control plasma and urine samples ranged from 2 to 18%, with recoveries of 66-115%. The method correlated to the gold standard GC-MS method for both serum (r\u202f≥\u202f0.996) and urine analysis (r\u202f≥\u202f0.949). The concentration of 3-HGA in normal, non-GA1 individuals was ≤25.2\u202fng\u202fmL (in plasma) and\u202f≤\u202f35.0\u202fμmol\u202fmmol of creatinine (in urine).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This LC-MS/MS method accurately quantified plasma and urine 3-HGA concentration after successful resolution from 2-HGA and other compounds with similar ion transitions. This method is suitable for confirmatory testing of 3-HGA, as a follow-up to an abnormal newborn screen test result, with concern for GA type 1.'
30218908	2018	'The hepatitis C caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an acute and/or chronic liver disease ranging in severity from a mild brief ailment to a serious lifelong illness that affects up to 3% of the world population and imposes significant and increasing social, economic, and humanistic burden. Over the past decade, its treatment was revolutionized by the development and introduction into clinical practice of the direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents targeting the non-structural viral proteins NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B. However, the current treatment options still have important limitations, thus, the development of new classes of DAAs acting on different viral targets and having better pharmacological profile is highly desirable. The hepatitis C virus p7 viroporin is a relatively small hydrophobic oligomeric viral ion channel that plays a critical role during virus assembly and maturation, making it an attractive and validated target for the development of the cage compound-based inhibitors. Using the homology modeling, molecular dynamics, and molecular docking techniques, we have built a representative set of models of the hepatitis C virus p7 ion channels (Gt1a, Gt1b, Gt1b_L20F, Gt2a, and Gt2b), analyzed the inhibitor binding sites, and identified a number of potential broad-spectrum inhibitor structures targeting them. For one promising compound, the binding to these targets was additionally confirmed and the binding modes and probable mechanisms of action were clarified by the molecular dynamics simulations. A number of compounds were synthesized, and the tests of their antiviral activity (using the BVDV model) and cytotoxicity demonstrate their potential therapeutic usefulness and encourage further more detailed studies. The proposed approach is also suitable for the design of broad-spectrum ligands interacting with other multiple labile targets including various viroporins.'
30218891	2018	'BACKGROUND: While human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing offers high sensitivity for the detection of significant cervical disease, its specificity is suboptimal given the high prevalence of transient HPV infections (CIN1 or less). Biomarkers to identify those suffering from low grade disease from those with high grade disease could save healthcare costs and reduce patient anxiety.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the present work was to develop and test an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based dual viral and cellular biomarker strategy which was applicable to liquid based cytology (LBC) samples.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: We developed a novel IHC assay for detection of HPV E4 and cellular minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins in routinely taken cervical LBC samples using cytospin-prepared slides. The assay was applied to a prospective cohort of Scottish women referred to a colposcopy clinic due to preceding cytological abnormalities. The performance of the biomarkers for detection of clinically insignificant (CIN1 or less) versus significant disease was determined.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 81 women were recruited representing 64 cases of <=CIN1 and 28 of CIN2\u2009+\u2009. Biomarker performance relative to histopathology outcomes showed high levels of MCM detection was significantly associated with CIN2+ (p\u2009=\u20090.03) while E4 was detected more frequently in <=CIN1 (p\u2009=\u20090.06).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Combined detection of a host proliferation marker and a marker of viral gene expression could allow triage of cases of clinically insignificant disease prior to colposcopy. However, there was overlap between distributions of MCM levels in CIN2+ and <=CIN1 suggesting that additional biomarkers would be required for improved specificity. Combined with cytospin-prepared slides this approach could provide a means of risk stratification of disease in low resource settings.'
30218890	2018	"""Metallodrugs have become an integral part of modern medicinal chemistry with platinum drugs as anti-cancer agents being well-known examples. The historically interesting compound Zeise's salt, potassium trichlorido(ethene)platinate(II) has scarcely been investigated in this context yet. This study is geared towards shedding light on the biological reactivity of this platinum complex. Mass Spectrometry tools were used to obtain a deeper understanding of its interactions with biomolecules on the molecular level. Angiotensin I and Ubiquitin were chosen as model systems. Comparison to Cisplatin show that Zeise's salt is more reactive towards nucleophilic sites in proteins. Our data indicate that the ethylene ligand remains on the platinum when coordinated to a nitrogen donor in the biomolecule and therefore offers a linkage for the introduction of further functionality. When attached to sulfur donors in the biomolecule, platinum(II) provides a site for the formation of crosslinks and loops in the biomolecules by losing all four of its initial ligands."""
30218877	2018	'Epidemiological studies show that maternal exposure to PM affects the neurodevelopment of the offspring, especially the neurocognitive function. However, no relevant experimental researches have been published on toxic mechanism and diet intervention. We evaluated the effects of exposure to different doses of PM on the behavioral development of offspring via a PM exposure model established by intratracheal instillation, explored its mechanism and the protective effects of quercetin and VC intervention, and focused on the protein expression of CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. Specifically, Exposure to PM during gestation and lactation period caused maternal oxidative stress. Maternal exposure to PM changed postnatal open-field behaviors in both gender, impaired spatial learning and memory in the female offspring, increased the level of IL-1β, IL-6, down-regulated p-CREB/CREB, BDNF, TrkB, p-CaMKII/CaMKII, p-CaMKIV/CaMKIV, up-regulated p-Akt/Akt and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in the offspring. In addition, maternal supplementation with quercetin ameliorate the maternal oxidative stress, improved progeny inflammatory response, regulated BDNF, TrkB, p-Akt/Akt, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in female offspring, regulated TrkB, p-CREB/CREB and p-Akt/Akt in male offspring. Maternal supplementation with VC increased the levels of CAT in maternal mice, up-regulated BDNF in female offspring, regulated p-CREB/CREB and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 in male offspring. Our findings indicate that PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and lactation could impair behavioral development of offspring. Quercetin shows more protective effects than VC. The mechanism of neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by PM may be related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response and modulation of the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.'

Precancerous lesions of gastric carcinoma (PLGC) is a class of gastric cancer which is closely related to the gastric mucosal pathology changes in the role of carcinogenic incentives, and plays key role in the progression of normal gastric mucosal cells into gastric cancerous cells. In current experiment, we explore the relationship between Chinese traditional medicine (Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction) and gastric cancer in the PLGC rat animal models and epithelial-mesenchymal transitioned GES-1 cells which were induced useing 1- Methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). PLGC rat model showed significant deterioration in the gastric mucosa with terrible growth rate in body weight and more atypical hyperplasia in gastric mucosa. MC cells, MNNG induced GES-1 cells which epithelial- mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-related proteins have a great change compare with normal GES-1 cells. The cells had characteristics of malignant cells including proliferation, invasion and metastasis ability. Our research founds that Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could inhibit cell proliferation and increased apoptosis by increase the level of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and caspase-3 and decreased the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, block the cells in G0/G1 phase simultaneously. Furthermore, Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could inhibit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer (NF-kB) activity and inhibit its transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. However, when we incubated with NF-κB activator PMA, the effect of Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction was reversed. These results suggested that Xiao Tan He Wei Decoction could be used as a method for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions, and possibly provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer and gastric precancerous lesions.'

G-protein coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is one of the receptors that binds to 17-β Estradiol (E2). To date, there is little information on GPR30 and its expression in postmenopausal type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the heart. The current study hypothesized that GPR30 mediated cardioprotective effects of E2 in ovariectomized diabetic rats. Female ovariectomized diabetic rats were divided in nine groups: Control, Vehicle, Diabetes, Proestrous, Non-proestrous, E, E2+Vehicle, E2+G15, and G1. G15 is a GPR30 antagonist, while G1 is an agonist of GPR30. T2D was induced by high fat diet and streptozotocin. E2, G1 and G15 were administrated for four weeks after establishment of T2D. Results showed that mean arterial pressure, fasting blood glucose and HOMA-IR in diabetic and vehicle groups were alleviated by E2 and G1, while salutary effects of E2 were inhibited by G15. Furthermore, E2 and G1 improved cardiac weight, atherogenic and cardiovascular risk indices; meanwhile G15 exacerbated cardiac weight and atherogenic indices. Also, diabetes increased cardiac levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 and E2 only decreased interleukin 6. Significant decrement in the level of interleukin 10, and GPR30 protein were observed in diabetic group, whereas E2 and G1 increased the cardiac levels of interleukin 10, and GPR30 protein. Our study suggested that beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects of E2 on diabetic cardiomyopathy are probably mediated via non-genomic E2 pathways.'

Aloperine, a quinolizidine alkaloid derived from the leaves of the Sophora plant, has displayed multiple pharmacological functions in several chronic diseases. In the current study, we investigated the neuro-protective effects of aloperine against cytotoxicity in mouse Neuro2a (N2a) cells transfected with Swedish amyloid precursor protein (Swe-APP) mutant and presenilin 1 exon 9 deletion mutant (N2a/Swe.D9). We found that aloperine ameliorated oxidative stress patterns in N2a/Swe.D9 cells by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, aloperine treatment led to elevated generation of ATP and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in N2a/Swe.D9 cells. Importantly, we found that aloperine treatment reduced the vulnerability of N2a/Swe.D9 cells to HO. Aloperine also inhibited apoptosis of N2a/Swe.D9 cells via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. These findings suggest that aloperine may have pharmacological potential for the treatment of AD."""

Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), an intracellular protein with the tissue-specific expression pattern, has been reported to be implicated in diverse types of human tumors. However, the biological role of FABP7 in CC is still poorly understood. The current study aimed to investigate the role of FABP7 in CC and illuminate the potential molecular mechanisms. In this present study, we found that FABP7 was highly expressed in CC tissues and cell lines, suggesting the possible involvement of FABP7 in CC tumorigenesis. Moreover, functional investigations showed that FABP7-overexpression promoted CC cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle progression and inhibited cell apoptosis; on the contrary, FABP7 knockdown produced an inhibitory effects on CC cell proliferation and survival. Notably, FABP7 knockdown inhibited colon tumor growth in vivo. In addition, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that FABP7 exerted its promoting effects on CC cell proliferation and survival through activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that FABP7 may be used as a novel diagnostic bio-marker and a potential therapeutic target for CC.'

To determine the in vivo effects, we employed an HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis rat model. We used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage model for in vitro assays. Griess and MTT assays were used to measure nitric oxide (NO) production and cell viability, respectively. We used real-time PCR to determine mRNA levels. To measure prostaglandin E (PGE) production we used a PGE EIA kit. To estimate protein levels and enzyme activities, we employed immunoblotting. Luciferase assays were used to examine nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB activities.\n\nRESULTS: Intragastric administration of Ac-EE (30mg/kg) ameliorated HCl/EtOH-induced stomach damages in SD rats. Ac-EE inhibited the levels of NO and PGE down regulated mRNA and protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2.

30218783	2018	'Fifteen million babies are born preterm every year and a significant number suffer from permanent neurological injuries linked to white matter injury (WMI). A chief cause of preterm birth itself and predictor of the severity of WMI is exposure to maternal-fetal infection-inflammation such as chorioamnionitis. There are no neurotherapeutics for this WMI. To affect this healthcare need, the repurposing of drugs with efficacy in other white matter injury models is an attractive strategy. As such, we tested the efficacy of GSK247246, an H3R antagonist/inverse agonist, in a model of inflammation-mediated WMI of the preterm born infant recapitulating the main clinical hallmarks of human brain injury, which are oligodendrocyte maturation arrest, microglial reactivity, and hypomyelination. WMI is induced by mimicking the effects of maternal-fetal infection-inflammation and setting up neuroinflammation. We induce this process at the time in the mouse when brain development is equivalent to the human third trimester; postnatal day (P)1 through to P5 with i.p. interleukin-1β (IL-1β) injections. We initiated GSK247246 treatment (i.p at 7mg/kg or 20mg/kg) after neuroinflammation was well established (on P6) and it was administered twice daily through to P10. Outcomes were assessed at P10 and P30 with gene and protein analysis. A low dose of GSK247246 (7 mg/kg) lead to a recovery in protein expression of markers of myelin (density of Myelin Basic Protein, MBP & Proteolipid Proteins, PLP) and a reduction in macro- and microgliosis (density of ionising adaptor protein, IBA1 & glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP). Our results confirm the neurotherapeutic efficacy of targeting the H3R for WMI seen in a cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis and a recently reported clinical trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Further work is needed to develop a slow release strategy for this agent and test its efficacy in large animal models of preterm infant WMI.'

In mammalian cells, iron regulatory protein 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are the central regulators of cellular iron metabolism. IRPs regulate iron metabolism by interacting with the RNA stem-loop structures, iron-responsive elements (IREs), found on the transcripts encoding proteins involved in iron metabolism only in iron depleted condition. It is also well-known that the ubiquitin system plays central roles in cellular iron regulation because both IRPs having the IRE binding activity are recognized and ubiquitinated by the SCF ubiquitin ligase in condition of iron-replete. FBXL5, which is a substrate recognition subunit of SCF, senses iron availability via its hemerythrin-like domain.

Retinas of B6C3H mice (genetic background of the TgM83 mouse) served as control. We used immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to detect accumulation of α-synuclein, pTau, inflammation, changes in macroautophagy, and cell death. Raman spectroscopy was used to test the potential to differentiate between retinal tissues of healthy mice and diseased mice. This work demonstrates retinal changes associated with the A53T mutation. Retinas of non-inoculated TgM83 mice had accumulation of α-synuclein, ""pre-tangle"" tau, activation of retinal glial cells, and photoreceptor cell loss by 8\u202fmonths of age. The development of these changes is accelerated by inoculation with brain homogenate from clinically ill TgM83 mice. Compared to non-inoculated 5-month-old TgM83 mice, retinas of inoculated 5-month-old mice had increased accumulation of α-synuclein (pSer129) and pTau proteins, upregulated microglial activation, and dysregulated macroautophagy. Raman spectroscopic analysis was able to discriminate between healthy and diseased mice. This study describes retinal pathology resulting from the A53T mutation. We show that seeding with brain homogenates from old TgM83 mice accelerates retinal pathology. We demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used to accurately identify a diseased retina based on its biochemical profile, and that α-synuclein accumulation may contribute to accumulation of pTau proteins, neuroinflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and photoreceptor cell death. Our work provides insight into retinal changes associated with Parkinson\'s disease, and may contribute to a better understanding of visual symptoms experienced by patients.'"
30218756	2018	'To demonstrate the usefulness of complementary next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) counting, we analyzed 196 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), and large-cell carcinoma (LCC) were used to prepare tissue microarrays and were examined by protein H-score IHC image analysis and NGS for oncogenes and proto-oncogenes and genes of tumor suppressors, immune checkpoints, epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). In patients with brain metastases, primary tumors expressed lower PIK3CA protein levels. Overexpression of TP53 and a higher PD-L1 protein H-score were detected in patients that underwent surgical treatment followed by chemotherapy as compared to those that underwent only surgical treatment The absence of brain metastases was associated with wild-type sequences of genes EGFR, CD267, CTLA-4, and ZEB1. The combination of protein overexpression according to IHC and mutation according to NGS was rare (i.e., represented by a very low percentage of concordant cases), except for TP53 and VEGF. Our data suggest that protein levels detected by IHC may be a useful complementary tool when mutations are not detected by NGS and also support the idea to expand this approach beyond ADC to include SqCC and even LCC, particularly for patients with unusual clinical characteristics. Conversely, well-pronounced immunogenotypic features appeared to predict the clinical outcome after univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with a solid ADC subtype and mutated genes EGFR, CTLA4, PDCD1LG2, or ZEB1 complemented with PD-L1 or TP53 protein lower expression that only underwent surgical treatment, who develop brain metastases, may have the worst prognosis.'

A total of 655 samples with full clinicopathological data were investigated in this study. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry (TMA-IHC) analysis was used to analyze the relationship between clinicopathological characteristics and ADAMTS-2 expression. Oncomine and Kaplan-Meier plotters were performed for the relationship analysis between prognosis and ADAMTS-2 expression in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Compared with that of normal tissues, the ADAMTS-2 protein expression was remarkably higher in gastric cancer cells and fibroblast cells. The results of univariate analysis indicated that the expression of ADAMTS-2 in tumor cells and fibroblast cells, Laurén classification, TNM grade, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in gastric cancer were all correlated with the overall survival. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that the high expression of ADAMTS-2 in gastric cancer cells and fibroblast cells both were independent prognostic factors. Therefore, ADAMTS-2 may be a potential biomarker for assessing the prognosis of gastric carcinoma.'

With lack of investigations for molecular pathogenesis underlying that develop BC, the therapeutic efficacy of several therapeutic approaches existing is still unsatisfactory. Here, our study aimed to explore the potentially biological function of MAN1B1 on BC. In this study, MAN1B1 expression level in BC tissues and normal tissues was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and correlation between its expression and prognosis was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Knockout of MAN1B1 was performed using silencing RNA and the efficacy of MAN1B1 knockout was identified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. The BC cells proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and then the cells apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry following MAN1B1 knocked down by small interfering RNA. Protein kinase B (AKT) signaling was evaluated by detecting related markers, namely AKT, p-AKT, 4E-BP-1 and Bax using western blot assay. As a result, the MAN1B1 expression was higher in BC tissues than those in normal tissues, besides, its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, MAN1B1 reduction by silencing RNA approach resulted in BC cells proliferation suppression and BC cells apoptosis promotion. Finally, AKT signaling activity was inhibited by MAN1B1 silencing. Taken together, these results unraveled that MAN1B1 may act on an oncogenic action in BC, which improved the likelihood of MAN1B1 taking on a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for treating BC.'

Conventional treatment options have limited efficacy because most cases are in the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. The present study evaluates the anti-cancer activity of 1,2-diazole (pyrazole), a natural compound from mangrove plant Rhizophora apiculata (R.apiculata) on A549 lung carcinoma cells. In the present study the anti-cancer mechanism of pyrazole, was examined by the expression level of proteins Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) which are commonly associated with the cell signaling pathways that control cell survival and apoptosis, that could facilitate to develop a novel target and effective treatment approach for patients with NSCLC. Pyrazole significantly induced cell cycle arrest and initiated apoptosis through inhibition of downstream components of EGFR tyrosine kinase pathway. Pyrazole disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential and modulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-2 which could probably lead to caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, Pyrazole suppresses the expression of CDK-2 resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and in the G1-S phase transition. Taken together, the current study provides new insight in to the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-cancer activity of pyrazole in NSCLC, A549 cells. The study opens an avenue for development of a natural compound as a potential therapeutic agent which could target cell signaling pathways to combat human NSCLC.'
30218745	2018	"""The human soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (hsEH) is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective signalling mediators known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs' conversion into the corresponding diols by hsEH generates non-bioactive molecules, thereby the enzyme inhibition would be expected to enhance the EETs bioavailability, and their beneficial properties. Numerous inhibitors have been developed to target the enzyme, some of which are showing promising antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. Thus far, the preparation of the recombinant enzyme for enzymatic and structural in vitro studies has been performed mainly using a baculovirus expression system. More recently, it was reported that the enzyme could be exogenously expressed and isolated from E. coli, although limited amounts of active protein were obtained. We herein describe two novel methods to yield pure recombinant enzyme. The first describes the expression and purification of the full-length enzyme from eukaryotic cells HEK293-F, whilst the second concerns the C-terminal domain of hsEH obtained from the cost-effective and rapid E. coli prokaryotic system. The two methods successfully generated satisfactory amounts of functional enzyme, with virtually identical enzymatic activity. Overall, the protocols described in this paper can be employed for the recombinant expression and purification of active hsEH, to be used in future biomedical investigations and for high-throughput inhibitors screenings, to effectively identify drug candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."""
30218741	2018	"'Macrophages represent key inflammatory cellular effectors of the innate immune response. Despite being widely acknowledged as professional phagocytes, the functional roles played by these cells have been progressively widened over the years to encompass regulation of the adaptive immune system, stimulation or suppression of cancer cell growth and tissue remodeling. These diverse functional features have led to the concept of ""macrophage plasticity"", i.e. the ability of these cells to express a wide range of phenotypes endowed with different functional roles. Several activation programs have been described for mammalian macrophages, based mainly on their differential transcriptional profiles. Based on established in vitro experimental conditions, many researchers currently refer to the M1 (or M1-like) and M2 (or M2-like) terms to describe the two extremes of a rather broad spectrum of polarization states that macrophages can experience in vivo. In light of the widely recognized opposite roles of M1-like and M2-like macrophages on cancer growth, and our largely incomplete knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of the M1-like versus M2-like balance within a tumor mass, we report here results from in vitro assays pointing at the human RNASET2 gene as a potential regulator of the balance between M1-like/M2-like macrophage polarization. Not only do our results confirm previous in vivo data, thus further supporting a role for this pleiotropic protein in the innate immune system, but they also define RNASET2 as a new molecular target with potential applications for in vivo reprogramming of macrophage polarization, an increasingly appraised anticancer strategy.'"

Subsequently, GNB5, CDC42, SPTAN1, GNG2, GNAZ, PRKACB, SST, CD44, FGF2, PHLPP1, APP, and FYN were identified as the candidate hub genes by using topological parameters. Later, Fpclass a PPI tool identified WASP gene, a co-expression interacting partner with highest network topology. Moreover, an enhanced enrichment pathway namely Opioid signaling was obtained using ClueGo, depicting the roles of the hub genes in signaling and neuronal mechanisms. The transcriptional regulatory factors and the common miRNA connected to them were identified by using MatInspector and miRTarbase. Later, a regulatory network constructed showed that PLAG, T2FB, CREB, NEUR, and GATA were the most commonly connected transcriptional factors and hsa-miR-122-5p was the most prominent miRNA.

30218736	2018	'The V antigen (LcrV) of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis is a potent protective protein that is considered as a vaccine component for humans. LcrV mediates the delivery of Yop toxins into host cells and upregulates TLR2-dependent IL-10 production. Although LcrV can interact with the receptor-bound human interferon-γ (hIFN-γ), the significance of these interactions in plague pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we determined the parameters of specific interactions of LcrV and LcrV with primary human thymocytes and Jurkat T-leukemia cells in the presence of receptor-bound hIFN-γ. Although the C-terminal region of hIFN-γ contains a GRRA site needed for high-affinity binding of LcrV and LcrV, in the hIFN-γ homodimer, these GRRA target sites becomes accessible for targeting by LcrV or LcrV only after immobilization of the hIFN-γ homodimer on the hIFN-γ receptors of thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells. The interaction of LcrV or LcrV with receptor-bound hIFN-γ on the thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells caused apoptosis of both cell types, which can be completely blocked by the addition of monoclonal antibodies specific to the LEEL and DEEI sites of LcrV. The ability of LcrV to utilize hIFN-γ is insidious and may account in part for the severe symptoms of plague in humans.'
30218730	2018	'Comparative studies of leafhopper mitochondrial genomes suggest that genome rearrangements are very rare in these insects but that nucleotide sequences are informative of phylogenetic relationships at various levels of divergence. A recent study reported that tRNA cluster trnW-trnC-trnY is rearranged to trnC-trnW-trnY in the Aster Leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus, an economically important North American species. The complete mitochondrial genome of the East Asian species, Macrosteles quadrimaculatus, sequenced and annotated here for the first time, reveals that this species shares the same tRNA rearrangement, suggesting it is a genus-level trait. The entire mitogenome of M. quadrimaculatus is a circular molecule 15,734\u202fbp in size comprising 37 genes and one control region, which is similar to other studied hemipteran mitogenomes. The whole mitogenome sequence shows heavily A\u202f+\u202fT biased nucleotide composition (77.7%) and moderately positive AT-skews (0.120). Except for the nad5 gene which starts with TTG and ends with incomplete codon T, all protein-coding genes begin with ATN codons and terminate with TAA. All tRNA genes have typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except for trnS1, in which dihydrouridine (DHU) stem is simplified to form a loop structure.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) was abundant in patients with periodontitis and was associated with patient clinic-pathological characteristics. Furthermore, autophagy is a potential mechanism in inflammatory disease. In this study, we hypothesized that LPS from P.g may affect the physiological functions of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) through activating cellular autophagy. However, it remains unclear what molecular basis related to LPS-induced autophagy in HGFs.\n\nMAIN METHODS: Here, we initially addressed the contribution of LPS from P.g in inducing autophagy in HGFs. Through a combination of morphology and quantification approaches involving autophagosomes formation observation as well as microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II conversion. We further evaluated whether the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could mediate LPS-induced autophagy in HGFs.\n\nKEY FINDINGS: Our results revealed that autophagy was more obvious in LPS-treated cells compared with that in control groups. Finally, our results demonstrated that LPS from P.g promoted autophagy in HGFs and was negatively regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of these data implicates that LPS from P.g has a significant impact on the autophagy of HGFs by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.'
30218717	2018	'The interaction between hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a diuretic drug, with human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by different biophysical approaches such as UV absorption, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and fluorescence spectroscopy in 50\u2009mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The results of fluorescence titration experiments revealed that HCTZ strongly quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA through a static quenching mechanism. Binding constants and the number of binding sites were calculated using Stern-Volmer plots. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding data elucidated that hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions played the major role in the binding process. Computation of the protein surface hydrophobicity (PSH) index using 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate indicated that considerable decrement in PSH value of the protein happened upon drug binding. The binding site of HCTZ in HSA was identified using warfarin and ibuprofen as site markers, a result confirmed by molecular docking study. The results of CD experiments showed that some alterations occurred in the structure of the protein upon ligation. Also, the results of FT-IR experiments were in good agreement with CD experiments. It looks like that both secondary and tertiary structures of HSA have been affected upon HCTZ binding.'

We hypothesize that one or more of the enzymes in the ethanol production pathway in C. thermocellum is not adequate for ethanol production at high titer. In this study, we focused on the enzymes responsible for the part of the ethanol production pathway from pyruvate to ethanol. In T. saccharolyticum, we replaced all of the genes encoding proteins in this pathway with their homologs from C. thermocellum and examined what combination of gene replacements restricted high ethanol titer. We found that a pathway consisting of Ct_nfnAB, Ct_fd, Ct_adhE and Ts_pforA was sufficient to support ethanol titer greater than 50g/L, however replacement of Ts_pforA by Ct_pfor1 dramatically decreased the maximum ethanol titer to 14g/L. We then demonstrated that the reason for reduced ethanol production is that the Ct_pfor1 is inhibited by accumulation of ethanol and NADH, while Ts_pforA is not.'

This organelle has its own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and genetic variants in this molecule can alter the normal energy metabolism in the brain, contributing to the development of a wide assortment of Neurological Disorders (ND), including neurodevelopmental syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. These ND are comprised by a heterogeneous group of syndromes and diseases that encompass different cognitive phenotypes and behavioral disorders, such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Huntington disease, Leigh Syndrome and bipolar disorder. In this work we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and describe the mitochondrial genetic variants associated with the occurrence of ND. Majority of genetic variants found in mtDNA were associated with Single Nucleotide Polimorphisms (SNPs), ~79%, with ~15% corresponding to deletions, ~3% to Copy Number Variations (CNVs), ~2% to insertions and another 1% included mtDNA replication problems and genetic rearrangements. We also found that most of the variants were associated with coding regions of mitochondrial proteins but were also found in regulatory transcripts (tRNA and rRNA) and in the D-Loop replication region of the mtDNA. After analysis of mtDNA deletions and CNV, none of them occur in the D-Loop region. This SLR shows that all transcribed mtDNA molecules have mutations correlated with ND. Finally, we describe that all mtDNA variants found were associated with deterioration of cognitive (dementia) and intellectual functions, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and personality and behavior problems."""

Testis tissue was exposed to androgen concentrations of 10\u202fM, 10\u202fM and 10\u202fM for 6, 12, 18 or 24\u202fh, after which a suite of steroidogenic genes, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βhsd) and cytochrome P450 17A1 (cyp17a1), were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both androgens affected steroidogenic gene expression, with most alterations occurring at the 24-hour time point. The gene with the highest fold-change, and shortest interval to expression alteration, was 3βhsd for both androgens. Potential differences between the two model androgens were observed in increased expression of cyp17a1 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βhsd), which were only altered after exposure to DHT and in expression levels of cytochrome P450 11A1 (cyp11a1), which was upregulated by MT but not altered by DHT. Results from this study show both androgens interact at the gonadal level of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and may possess some distinct gene expression impacts.

Focusing on expression of the surface marker CD36, the potential role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was examined using various PPARγ agonists and antagonists. As the PPARγ ligand-binding domain contains multiple ligand-binding sites (LBS), agonist and antagonists targeting the different sites were used. DBP accelerated PMA-induced morphological changes and increased expression of CD36, although to a lesser degree than the PPARγ agonists rosiglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). A proteomics screening revealed that DBP enhanced expression of PPARγ-regulated proteins. During combined exposures, DBP partly attenuated the effect of rosiglitazone, an agonist binding reversibly to PPARγ's canonical LBS. In contrast, DBP increased expression of CD36 in combination with 15d-PGJ2 which binds irreversibly to the canonical LBS. Thus, DBP appears to interact with both the canonical and alternative LBS. In line with this, the antagonist GW9662 binding to the canonical LBS, only partly reduced DBP effects on CD36, while the dual-site PPARγ antagonist SR16832 completely blocked the effects of DBP. Overall, the results show that DBP modifies PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells through interaction with PPARγ."""

30218679	2018	'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The progression of hepatosteatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a critical step in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular cancer. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for this progression is essentially unknown. This study was designed to determine the role of miR-378 in regulating NASH progression.\n\nMETHODS: We used immunohistochemistry, luciferase assays and immunoblotting to study the role of miR-378 in modulating an inflammatory pathway. Wild-type mice kept on a high fat diet (HFD) were injected with miR-378 inhibitors or a mini-circle expression system containing miR-378 to study loss and gain-of functions of miR-378.\n\nRESULTS: MiR-378 expression is increased in livers of dietary obese mice and NASH patients. Further studies revealed that miR-378 directly targeted Prkag2 that encodes AMP-activated protein kinase γ 2 (AMPKγ2). AMPK signaling is a negative regulator of NFκB-TNFα inflammatory axis by increasing deacetylase activity of Sirtuin 1. By targeting Prkag2, miR-378 reduced Sirtuin1 activity and facilitated an inflammatory pathway involving NFκB-TNFα. In contrast, miR-378 knockdown using its inhibitor induced expression of Prkag2, increased Sirtuin1 activity and blocked NFκB-TNFα axis. Additional knockdown of increased Prkag2 offset the inhibitory effects of miR-378 inhibitor on the NFκB-TNFα axis, suggesting that AMPK signaling mediates the role of miR-378 in facilitating this inflammatory pathway. Liver-specific expression of miR-378 triggered the development of NASH and fibrosis by activating TNFα signaling. Ablation of TNFα in miR-378-treated mice impaired the ability of miR-378 to facilitate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that TNFα signaling is required for miR-378 to promote NASH.\n\nCONCLUSION: MiR-378 plays a key role in the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by facilitating NFκB-TNFα axis; and might act as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH. Lay summary The recent epidemic increase in obesity has been associated with a sharp rise in the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

30218674	2018	'Microglia activation and neuroinflammation play important roles in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury (SBI). In this study, we attempted to investigate the potential effects of Andrographolide (Andro) on ICH-induced SBI and the possible mechanisms behind these effects. Andro treatment effectively reduced neuronal cell death and degeneration and alleviated neurobehavioral disorders and brain edema in vivo. In an in vitro study, microglia activation-induced neuronal cell death was ameliorated by Andro treatment. In addition, microglia activation and neuroinflammation were induced by ICH, exhibiting elevated cytokine levels, which could be reversed with Andro treatment. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly decreased after treatment with Andro, both in vivo and in vitro, due to the inhibition of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway activation. Meanwhile, Andro decreased the levels of IL-1β and LDH, as well as microglia pyroptosis induced by ICH by suppressing the assembly of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. In summary, this study reveals an anti-inflammatory effect of Andro and its potential mechanisms, and it shows that Andro is a potential candidate for improving ICH-induced SBI.'
30218671	2018	'BACKGROUND: Ischemia and reperfusion remain inseparable elements of numerous medical procedures such as by-pass surgery, organ transplantation or other cardiology and intervention radiology. The contraction of the smooth muscle of the vessel is considered to be one of the basic components leading to impaired perfusion, an increase in the oxygen deficit of the endothelium of the vessel, and subsequently also to tissues vascularized by the vessel. Main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ischemia and reperfusion on vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated pharmacologically with mastoparan-7 (direct G-protein activator) in comparison to stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor agonist - phenylephrine, and direct calcium channel activator - Bay K8644.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Experiments were performed on isolated and perfused tail artery of Wistar rats. Contraction force in our model was measured by increased level of perfusion pressure with a constant flow.\n\nRESULTS: Concentration-response curves obtained for phenylephrine, mastoparan-7 and Bay K8644 presented a sigmoidal relation. Ischemia induced hyporreactivity of vessels, whereas during reperfusion the significant time related hyperreactivity for phenylephrine and mastoparan-7 only but not for Bay K8644. These reactions were secondary to the modulation of calcium influx from intra- and extracellular calcium stores.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Results of our experiments suggest that mastoparan-7 significantly induces contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells not only for controls but in the presence of ischemia and reperfusion too. Potential therapeutic applications of the observed reactions are important. They may include regenerative processes within the nervous system, studies on the improvement of blood flow within the microcirculation, or antimicrobial activity. Modulation of the G protein-phospholipase C response may also be an interesting point of action of future drugs modifying the response to stimulation during ischemia in particular, such activities could take place during the transport of organs for transplantation.'
30218660	2018	'Increased plasma triglyceride serves as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes circulating triglyceride, plays a crucial role in normal lipid metabolism and energy balance. Hypertriglyceridemia is possibly caused by gene mutations resulting in LPL dysfunction. There are many factors that both positively and negatively interact with LPL thereby impacting TG lipolysis. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), a newly identified factor, appears essential for transporting LPL to the luminal side of the blood vessel and offering a platform for TG hydrolysis.

Thus, host skin cells are permissive to ZIKV infection and are the first line of defense against the virus. Here, we examined the role and mechanisms of antiviral skin immunity against ZIKV infection. ZIKV infection (African lineage MR766) in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn), and HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in distinct expression changes in retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLR), such as RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Interestingly, inhibition of RIG-I using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in increased viral gene expression and reduced induction of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, ZIKV non-structural protein 1 directly interacted with RIG-I or MDA5 and downregulated RLR-mediated antiviral signaling pathways. Asian lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59) infection also showed a distinct pattern of antiviral immunity in human skin cells, compared to other ZIKV strains. Additionally, ZIKV infections in human neural progenitor cells induced the robust activation of RLR-mediated signaling, followed by highly enhanced ISG expression.

Recent studies have established two Geminin family coiled-coil containing nuclear regulatory proteins, Gmnc and Multicilin (Mci), in the specification and differentiation of the MCCs. Both Gmnc and Mci are devoid of a DNA binding domain: they regulate transcription by associating with E2f family transcription factors, notably E2f4 and E2f5. Here, we have studied the relative contribution of these two E2f factors in MCC development using the zebrafish embryo, which differentiates MCCs within kidney tubules and the nose. We found that while E2f4 is fully dispensable, E2f5 is essential for MCCs to form in the kidney tubules. Moreover, using a variety of double mutant combinations we show that E2f5 has a more prominent role in MCC development in the zebrafish than E2f4. This contrasts with current evidence from the mouse, where E2f4 seems to be more important. Thus, distinct combinatorial activities of the E2f4 and E2f5 proteins regulate the specification and differentiation of MCCs in zebrafish and mice.'
30218622	2018	"""OBJECTIVES: To present clinical and cytopathologic features of 9 cases of chordomas, diagnosed over 9 years' duration and confirmed by brachyury (T) immunostaining.\n\nMETHODS: Conventional cytologic smears, stained with Papanicolaou and May Grunwald Giemsa, along with corresponding histopathologic (n=8) and immunostained sections (n=8) were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue sections by polymer detection technique.\n\nRESULTS: Nine tumours occurred in 7 males and 2 females, with age ranging from 36 to 72 years (average=58.7), in the sacrum (7) and spine (2). On FNAC, 5 cases were either diagnosed or diagnosed with a 'suggestion' of a chordoma; while three cases were diagnosed with chordoma, as a differential diagnosis. On review, smears were moderately cellular, comprising myxoid stroma (9/9), epithelioid cells (9/9), physaliphorous cells (8/9), including binucleation (7/9), prominent nucleolisation (2/9), pleomorphic cells (2/9) and intranuclear inclusions (3/9). Immunohistochemically, tumour cells expressed cytokeratin (4/4), pan cytokeratin (4/4), EMA (8/8), S100 protein (6/8) and brachyury (8/8). Five patients underwent surgical excision, including two underwent adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and four patients, who underwent RT. During follow-up (n=8), a single patient developed recurrence and another presented with metastatic lesions. Finally, 5 patients were alive-with-disease (7 to 53 months); a single patient was free-of-disease (4 months) and two patients died-of-disease, the latter cases displayed pleomorphic cells and intranuclear inclusions.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Chordomas can be primarily diagnosed by FNAC in a typical clinico-radiologic setting with combination of 'key' cytomorphologic features. Pleomorphic cells and intranuclear inclusions are associated with a relatively aggressive subtype. An exact diagnosis has treatment implications and requires confirmation by brachyury immunostaining.

30218612	2018	"""Cutaneous deposition of eosinophil degranulation proteins is a major feature of eosinophil rich cutaneous diseases including bullous pemphigoid (BP). We sought to better understand the effect of two of these proteins -eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN), on human keratinocytes using the Het-1A cell line. To evaluate expression of key cytokines and chemokines observed in BP as well as metal metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), we performed qPCR and in-cell Western assays on cells treated with either ECP or EDN. We further evaluated the effect of ECP and EDN on keratinocyte survival, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. Lastly, we assessed ECP and EDN's ability to induce keratinocyte detachment from provisional matrix. Treatment of keratinocytes with ECP and EDN resulted in significant increases in IL-5, eotaxin-1 and CCL5 (RANTES) expression at both mRNA and protein levels, but not IL-17 or IL-31. ECP and EDN also upregulate MMP9 production. Inhibiting MMP9, we confirmed that keratinocyte expression of IL-5, eotaxin-1, and RANTES was independent from MMP9. Both ECP and EDN were cytotoxic to keratinocytes, inducing ROS formation and apoptosis through a mitochondrion-dependent pathway as evidenced by results of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and cytochrome c release assays, respectively. ECP but not EDN led to significant keratinocyte detachment from provisional matrix. These findings demonstrate that the pathogenic effects of ECP and EDN in BP may result from their direct action on keratinocytes, and as such may became a target for future therapies in eosinophil rich cutaneous diseases.

30218608	2018	'BACKGROUND Studies on the chondrocyte inflammatory injury are very important for understanding the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Evidence suggests that N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) may be used as an adjuvant therapy alongside established methods of OA treatment. This study investigated the effect of NMP on chondrocyte inflammatory injury and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS To mimic the inflammatory injury in vitro, the articular chondrocyte line ATDC5 was simulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ATDC5 cells were treated with various concentrations of NMP (0, 5, and 10 nM). Cell viability was measured using CCK-8 assay; cell apoptosis was detected using FCM; related protein and mRNA expressions were determined using Western blot assay and qRT-PCR assay; and inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) productions were measured by performing ELISA assay. RESULTS The results showed that LPS simulation repressed ATDC5 cell viability, prompted cell apoptosis, and enhanced the secretion of inflammatory factors. NMP treatment reduced inflammatory injury induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, NMP inhibited the activation of JNK and p38 pathways. In addition, inhibition of NF-κB activation was observed following NMP treatment. CONCLUSIONS NMP prevents inflammatory reaction of articular chondrocytes via repressing the MAPK/NF-kB pathway. Our findings provide a promising therapeutic agent for OA treatment.'
30218597	2018	"""The functionality of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is modulated by phosphorylation, eEF2 is simultaneously the molecular target of ADP-ribosylating toxins. We analyzed the interplay between phosphorylation and diphthamide-dependent ADPribosylation. Phosphorylation does not require diphthamide, eEF2 without it still becomes phosphorylated. ADP-ribosylation not only modifies the H715 diphthamide but also inhibits phosphorylation of S595 located in proximity to H715, and stimulates phosphorylation of T56. S595 can be phosphorylated by CDK2 and CDK1 which affects EEF2K-mediated T56- phosphorylation. Thus, ADP-ribosylation and S595-phosphorylation by kinases occur within the same vicinity and both trigger T56-phosphorylation. Diphthamide is surface-accessible permitting access to ADP-ribosylating enzymes, the adjacent S595 side chain extends into the interior. This orientation is incompatible with phosphorylation, neither allowing kinase access nor phosphate attachment. S595 phosphorylation must therefore be accompanied by structural alterations affecting the interface to ADP-ribosylating toxins. In agreement with that, replacement of S595 with Ala, Glu or Asp prevents ADP-ribosylation. Phosphorylation (starvation) as well as ADP-ribosylation (toxins) inhibit protein synthesis, both affect the S595/H715 region of eEF2, both trigger T57-phosphorylation eliciting similar transcriptional responses. Phosphorylation is short lived while ADP-ribosylation is stable. Thus, phosphorylation of the S595/H715 'modifier region' triggers transient interruption of translation while ADP-ribosylation arrests irreversibly."""

The present review summarizes the role of kefir microorganisms in grain assembly and in the beneficial properties attributed to kefir. The use of both culture dependent and independent methods has made possible to determine the microorganisms that constitute this ecosystem. Kefir consumption has been associated with a wide range of functional and probiotic properties that could be attributed to the microorganisms present in kefir and/or to the metabolites synthetized by them during milk fermentation. In this context, the role of microorganisms in kefir health promoting properties is discussed with particular attention to the yeasts contribution as well as bioactive metabolites such as lactic and acetic acid, exopolysaccharides and bioactive peptides. Even though many advances on the knowledge of this ancient fermented milk have been made, further studies are necessary to elucidate the complex nature of the kefir ecosystem.

30218586	2018	'The target of the current research was to investigate the anticancer activity of sitagliptin on diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced cancer in the liver. Wistar rats were treated with or without sitagliptin before DENA treatment. We detected liver weight, blood glucose, and histopathology of the liver. Serum biochemical markers like serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), total bilirubin (TBR), total protein (TPR), and albumin (ALB) were also evaluated. In addition, lipid profile parameters comprising total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein were also measured. Inflammatory mediators like interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were determined in liver homogenate. Furthermore, the activity of nuclear factor (NF-κB) was also measured. Our results showed that sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner expressively decreased the DENA-induced elevation of SGPT, SGOT, SALP, and GGTP. Whereas sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) in a dose-dependent mode reduced the level of TBR and increased the TPR and ALB as well as improved the liver histopathology alterations in DENA-exposed rats. Lipid profile was also restored by the sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) in a DENA-treated rats. The level of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were suggestively suppressed. Moreover, pretreatment with sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) prevented the activation of NF-κB. In conclusion, sitagliptin (10 and 20\u2009mg/kg) has a potential protective effect against DENA-induced liver cancer by inhibition of inflammation and NF-κB activation.'
30218574	2018	"'Current dogma holds that the heart balances energy demand and supply effectively and sustainably by sequestering enough Ca into mitochondria during heartbeats to stimulate metabolic enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC). This process is called excitation-contraction-bioenergetics (ECB) coupling. Recent breakthroughs on the identity of mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU) and its associated proteins have opened up new windows for interrogating the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca homeostasis regulation and its role in ECB coupling. Despite remarkable progresses made in the past 7 years, it has been surprising or ""disappointing"" that germline MCU deficiency in mice with certain genetic background yields viable pups, and knockout of MCU in adult heart does not cause lethality. Moreover, MCU deficiency results in few adverse phenotypes, normal performance, and preserved bioenergetics in the heart at baseline. In this review, we briefly assess the existing literature on mitochondrial Ca homeostasis regulation and then we consider possible explanations for why MCU-deficient mice are spared from energy crisis under physiological conditions. We propose that MCU and/or mitochondrial Ca may have limited ability to set ECB coupling; that other mitochondrial Ca handling mechanisms may play a role; and that extra-mitochondrial Ca may regulate ECB coupling. Since the heart needs to regenerate a significant amount of ATP to assure the perpetual heartbeats, multiple mechanisms likely work in concert to match energy supply with demand.

30218573	2018	'EAU, an animal model for severe intraocular inflammatory eye diseases, is mediated by both Th1 and Th17 cells. Here, we examined the capacity of TMP778, a selective inhibitor of RORγt, to inhibit the development of EAU, as well as the related immune responses. EAU was induced in B10.A mice by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP). Treatment with TMP778 significantly inhibited the development of EAU, determined by histological examination. In addition, the treatment suppressed the cellular immune response to IRBP, determined by reduced production of IL-17 and IFN-γ, as well as lower percentages of lymphocytes expressing these cytokines, as compared to vehicle-treated controls. The inhibition of IFN-γ expression by TMP778 is unexpected in view of this compound being a selective inhibitor of RORγt. The observation was further confirmed by the finding of reduced expression of the T-bet (Tbx21) gene, the transcription factor for IFN-γ,\xa0by cells of TMP778-treated mice. Thus, these data demonstrate the capacity of TMP778 to inhibit pathogenic autoimmunity in the eye and shed new light on its mode of action in vivo.

30218550	2018	'In rat Leydig cells, glucocorticoids (GCs) inhibit testosterone production through the interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, the sensitivity of those cells to GCs is regulated by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 (11β-HSD1). In the testes of the toad Rhinella arenarum, the presence of an 11β-HSD similar to type 2 and a cytosolic GR has also been described. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of GCs on amphibian testicular steroidogenesis. In this study, the effects of corticosterone on androgen production, and the activity of two steroidogenic enzymes in toad testes were reported. Corticosterone inhibits androgen production via the GR because the GR antagonist RU486 prevents corticosterone-induced inhibition of testosterone. Corticosterone also reduced the activity of the cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase, C17,20-lyase (Cyp450  ) without affecting the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activity. This effect on Cyp450  was likewise inhibited by RU486. On the other hand, corticosterone had no effect on the amount of steroidogenic acute regulator protein. These results suggest that GCs inhibit steroidogenesis in toad testes by reducing of Cyp450  activity via a GR-mediated mechanism.'
30218537	2018	'In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

Here we used genetic and pathological methods to evaluate roles of Arabidopsis UBC13 in response to pathogens and environmental stresses. Loss of UBC13 failed to activate the expression of numerous cold-responsive genes and resulted in hypersensitivity to low-temperature stress, indicating that UBC13 is involved in plant response to low-temperature stress. Furthermore, the ubc13 mutant displayed low-temperature-induced and salicylic acid-dependent lesion mimic phenotypes. Unlike typical lesion mimic mutants, ubc13 did not enhance disease resistance against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens, but diminished hypersensitive response and compromised effector-triggered immunity against avirulent bacterial pathogens. UBC13 differently regulates two types of programmed cell death in response to low temperature and pathogen. The lesion mimic phenotype in the ubc13 mutant is partially dependent on SNC1. UBC13 interacts with an F-box protein CPR1 that regulates the homeostasis of SNC1. However, the SNC1 protein level was not altered in the ubc13 mutant, implying that UBC13 is not involved in CPR1-regulated SNC1 protein degradation. Taken together, our results revealed that UBC13 is a key regulator in plant response to low temperature and pathogens.'

Many of these autoantibodies target the extracellular domain of neuronal surface proteins and associate with highly specific phenotypes, suggesting they have pathogenic potential. Below, we describe the phenotypes associated with some of these commoner autoantibody-mediated movement disorders, and outline increasingly well-established mechanisms of autoantibody pathogenicity which include antigen downregulation and complement fixation. Despite these advances, and the increasingly robust evidence for improved clinical outcomes with early escalation of immunotherapies, the underlying cellular immunology of these conditions has received little attention. Therefore, here, we outline the likely roles of T cells and B cells in the generation of autoantibodies, and reflect on how these may guide both current immunotherapy regimes and our future understanding of precision medicine in the field. In addition, we summarise potential mechanisms by which these peripherally-driven immune responses may reach the central nervous system. We integrate this with the immunologically-relevant clinical observations of preceding infections, tumours and human leucocyte antigen-associations to provide an overview of the therapeutically-relevant underlying adaptive immunology in the autoantibody-mediated movement disorders. ©2018 The Authors.

30218496	2018	"""A good portion of the 'protein universe' embodies the 'dark proteome'. The latter comprises proteins not amenable to experimental structure determination by existing means and inaccessible to homology modeling. Hence, the dark proteome has remained largely unappreciated. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that lack rigid 3D structure are a major component of this dark proteome across all three kingdoms of life. Despite lack of structure, IDPs play critical roles in numerous important biological processes. Furthermore, IDPs serve as crucial constituents of proteinaceous membrane-less organelles (PMLOs), where they often serve as drivers and controllers of biological liquid-liquid phase transitions responsible for the PMLO biogenesis. In this perspective, we discuss the role of IDPs in i) the origin of prebiotic life and the evolution of the first independent primordial living unit akin to Tibor Gánti's chemoton, which preceded the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), ii) role in multicellularity and hence, in major evolutionary transitions, and iii), their role in phenotypic switching, and the emergence of new traits and adaptive opportunities via non-genetic, protein-based, mechanisms. The emerging picture suggests that, despite being major constituents of the dark matter, IDPs may be the dark horse in the protein universe. This article is protected by copyright.

30218458	2018	'Several tissue clearing methods have been developed for three-dimensional imaging of thick specimens. Here, we applied CUBIC and ScaleS approaches to whole-mounted vaginal wall to reveal spatial distribution of γδ T lymphocytes - the key cells engaged in the epithelial homeostasis control and immune surveillance. Both methods rendered the tissue transparent and enabled detection of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing γδ T cells in vaginal samples of Tcrd-H2BeGFP transgenic mice. Upon additional immunolabeling, however, only CUBIC preserved GFP signal and allowed for cell localization assessment during the estrous cycle. Using a combination of single- and two-photon microscopy we found that during the diestrus phase the number of γδ T cells in the vaginal wall increased compared to estrus, while proportion of cells residing in epithelium and stroma remained constant, irrespective of the cycle phase, and was close to 3:1, respectively. Moreover, the distance of epithelial γδ T cells to laminin-positive basal membrane and collagen-rich stroma also increased in diestrus in spite of thinning of epithelium upon shedding cornified cells. Our data indicate that γδ T cells sense sex hormone fluxes which influence their number and position them closer to vaginal lumen in the diestrus phase. This article is protected by copyright.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCT-116 was cultured in the matrix with various stiffness. The siYAP was applied to detect the changes of stemness markers. The cancer stemness markers, Yes-associated protein (YAP), Lamin A/C and downstream protein molecules, and their activation were measured after the treatment with anti-β1-integrin and FAK inhibitors. In CRC tissue samples, collagen deposition and the expression of α-SMA and CD133 were detected. The study found that the expression level of stemness markers and Lamin A/C increased as the matrix stiffness raised and was regulated by YAP activation in CRC stem cells. Inhibition of β1-integrin and FAK activation in a high stiffness cell culture medium significantly decreased the activation of YAP, PI3K, and AKT. Collagen was highly deposited in the CRC invasive tumor front (ITF), and the expression of CD133 was higher in ITF compared with normal tissue and the tumor cells. Moreover, the expression level of α-SMA was positively correlated with CD133 expression level. Together, our results suggest that activation of YAP in CRC plays an important role in the promotion of cancer stem cell properties by extracellular matrix stiffness in CRC.'

Here, we have carried out a systematic study to find the mechanisms of NO-induced regulation of RBC deformability under hypoxia.\n\nMETHODS: NO levels, RBCs membrane elongation index (EI), membrane protein band 3 methemoglobin (MetHb) were determined during hypoxia (0 to 120\u2009minutes). To validate the role of NO in regulating RBC deformability, tests were also performed with a NO donor (sodium nitroprusside) or a NO synthase inhibitor (l-nitro-arginine methylester) under 60\u2009minutes hypoxia.\n\nRESULTS: Hypoxia for 45\u2009minutes increased NO levels from 25.65\u2009±\u20091.95 to 35.26\u2009±\u20092.01\u2009μmol/L, and there was a plateau after 60\u2009minutes hypoxia. The EI did not change before 45\u2009minutes hypoxia, but decreased from 0.567\u2009±\u20090.019 to 0.409\u2009±\u20090.042 (30\u2009Pa) after 60\u2009minutes hypoxia. The cross-linking of band 3 and phosphotyrosine increased after 45\u2009minutes hypoxia. All can be alleviated by supplement NO and aggregated by inhibiting NOS. However, the MetHb was not present this trend.\n\nCONCLUSION: NO may prevent decreased of RBCs deformability through reducing the cross-linking of membrane band 3 under hypoxia; this helps microvascular perfusion of RBCs during ischemic and hypoxic disease states.'
30218437	2018	'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of 26 inflammatory biomarkers (acute phase proteins, cytokines, chemokines) and renal markers with coronary lipid core burden index (LCBI) assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging, as well as the association of these biomarkers with long-term cardiovascular outcome.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: NIRS-derived LCBI has recently been shown to be an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). However, studies on the association between circulating biomarkers and NIRS-derived characteristics have not yet been performed. Between 2008 and 2011, 581 patients underwent diagnostic coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). NIRS of a non-culprit vessel was performed in a subset of 203 patients. In multivariable analyses, TNF-α tended to be associated with higher LCBI (beta 0.088\xa0ln (pg/ml) increase per unit LCBI; 95% CI 0.000-0.177, p\u2009=\u20090.05) after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, this association did not persist after Bonferroni correction (statistical threshold 0.0019). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were registered in 581 patients during a median follow-up time of 4.7\xa0years (IQR: [4.2-5.6] years). After adjustment for clinical characteristics and Bonferroni correction, IL-8 (HR 1.60; 95% CI [1.18-2.17] per ln (pg/ml), p\u2009=\u20090.002) was borderline associated with MACE and significantly associated with all-cause mortality or ACS (HR 1.75; 95% CI [1.24-2.48] per ln (pg/ml), p\u2009=\u20090.0015). In conclusion, we found that IL-8 was independently associated with clinical outcome, but altogether, the multiplex panel we investigated here did not render a useful blood biomarker of high LCBI.'

The prevalence of ALK rearrangement in non-adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancers (NA-NSCLC) is currently unknown. In addition, the efficacy of crizotinib in these patients has not been well established.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of ALK rearrangement in NA-NSCLC patients and the therapeutic efficacy of crizotinib in these patients.\n\nMETHODS: We included NA-NSCLC patients who were tested for the presence of ALK rearrangement in our institution from January 2013 to May 2018. The effectiveness of crizotinib in ALK-positive patients was retrospectively analyzed. A literature review was performed and eligible previously published cases were analyzed in combination with our data.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 4662 patients were screened and 1696 NA-NSCLC patients were tested for the presence of ALK rearrangement during the study period. Thirty-two positive patients were identified (1.9%, 95% CI, 1.2-2.5%). A statistically higher percentage of younger (58.0 vs. 63.0, p\u2009=\u20090.01), female patients (53.1% vs. 10.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) who were non-smokers (71.9% vs. 40.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and whose tumors contained adenocarcinoma components (34.4% vs. 6.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) were observed in the ALK-positive group. Eighteen patients were excluded from the study and 14 eligible patients were included for survival analysis. The median duration of crizotinib treatment (MDT) as a proxy for progression-free survival of the 14 eligible patients in our institution was 6.0\xa0months (95% CI, 1.2-10.8\xa0months). We combined our data with sporadic cases from 16 previous publications (total n\u2009=\u200937) and found that the MDT was 7.0\xa0months (95% CI, 6.0-8.0\xa0months).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the opportunity to test ALK rearrangement in NA-NSCLC patients, especially in younger, female, non-smoking patients containing adenocarcinoma components. Crizotinib provides an option for the treatment of NA-NSCLC patients who have an ALK rearrangement.'

30218400	2018	"""Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the several neurodegenerative diseases where accumulation of aggregated proteins like α-synuclein occurs. Dysfunction in autophagy leading to this protein build-up and subsequent dopaminergic neurodegeneration may be one of the causes of PD. The mechanisms that impair autophagy remain poorly understood. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpiridium ion (MPP) is a neurotoxin that induces experimental PD in vitro. Our studies have shown that glia maturation factor (GMF), a brain-localized inflammatory protein, induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD and that suppression of GMF prevents MPP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, we demonstrate a molecular action of GMF on the autophagic machinery resulting in dopaminergic neuronal loss and propose GMF-mediated autophagic dysfunction as one of the contributing factors in PD progression. Using dopaminergic N27 neurons, primary neurons from wild type (WT), and GMF-deficient (GMF-KO) mice, we show that GMF and MPP enhanced expression of MAPKs increased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers such as phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (p-PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). Further, GMF and MPP reduced Beclin 1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family-interacting protein of 200\xa0kD (FIP200), and autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) 3, 5, 7, 16L, and 12. The combined results demonstrate that GMF affects autophagy through autophagosome formation with significantly reduced lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1/2, and the number of autophagic acidic vesicles. Using primary neurons, we show that MPP treatment leads to differential expression and localization of p62/sequestosome and in GMF-KO neurons, there was a marked increase in p62 staining implying autophagy deficiency with very little co-localization of α-synuclein and p62 as compared with WT neurons. Collectively, this study provides a bidirectional role for GMF in executing dopaminergic neuronal death mediated by autophagy that is relevant to PD."""
30218397	2018	'INTRODUCTION: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating, progressive neuromuscular disorder for which there is no cure. As the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs predominately in males. DMD is caused by a lack of functional dystrophin protein resulting from mutations in the 2.2-Mb DMD gene, whichdisrupts the reading frame. Care considerations for DMD advocate a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to the management of DMD in order to optimize management of the primary manifestations of DMD as well as any secondary complications that may arise.\n\nMETHODS: This review provides an overview of the multidisciplinary clinical management of DMD with regard to the respiratory, cardiology, orthopedic, and nutritional needs of patients with DMD. Recent advances in novel disease-modifying treatments for DMD are also discussed with specific reference to exon skipping and suppression of premature stop codons as promising genetic therapies.\n\nRESULTS: The combination of multidisciplinary clinical management alongside novel gene therapiesoffers physicians a powerful armamentarium for the treatment of DMD.'
30218387	2018	"""OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests that leptin is upregulated during allergic reactions in the airway and related to the severity of disease in allergic rhinitis (AR). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of leptin during sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in AR patients.\n\nMETHODS: Forty AR patients without obesity were recruited in this study. Twenty patients received house dust mite (HDM) allergen extract for SLIT and twenty patients received placebo randomly. Protein expression of leptin in serum and nasal lavage was tested by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) 1 and 2 years after SLIT treatment, respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human nasal epithelial cell were prepared and stimulated by recombinant leptin after 24 months' SLIT treatment and the induction of Th2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) were detected by ELISA.\n\nRESULTS: SLIT treatment decreased the expression of leptin protein in serum and nasal lavage significantly compared with placebo group 1 and 2 years after SLIT treatment. Nasal leptin level was correlated to decreased Th2 response (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) and enhanced Treg (IL-10/TGF-beat) response after 2 years' SLIT. We also found that SLIT decreased the ability of leptin in promoting Th2 cytokines expression by PBMCs and human nasal epithelial cell after 2 years' SLIT treatment.\n\nCONCLUSION: Changes of leptin expression in serum and nasal lavage may be correlated with Th2/Treg regulation during SLIT. Our results suggested that leptin served as an important biomarker during SLIT."""

Moreover, protein populations that are detected before unmasking can be very different to those seen after removal of nucleic acids. This is particularly true for components of the nuclear matrix, including those known to function at the inactive X chromosome. Here we describe an unmasking protocol that reveals previously undetected proteins at the inactive X chromosome in mouse fibroblasts.'

Recently, these modifications have been visualized not only in fixed specimen, but also in living cells via probes derived from modification-specific antibodies. The probes include fluorescently labeled antigen binding fragments (Fabs), which can be loaded into cells, as well as genetically encoded single-chain variable fragments tagged with the green fluorescent protein.

XCI is essential for female mammalian development, and its failure can lead to embryonic death in mutant mice. The pattern of which X chromosome is inactivated changes dynamically during mouse embryogenesis, depending on developmental stages and tissues. Recent progress in molecular biology, including next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based analyses, enables the analysis of gene expression profiles at a single cell level.

30218352	2018	'Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a heme pathway disorder caused by a decrease in the activity and synthesis of porphobilinogen deaminase. Thus, the first heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) accumulates in the liver. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from ALA oxidation may be correlated to a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in AIP patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of this relationship have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we investigated the effect of increasing levels of ALA on the expression of proteins related to DNA repair, oxidative stress, apoptosis, proliferation and lipid metabolism. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method, lipoperoxidation was evaluated by a TBA fluorimetric assay and Western blotting was used to assess protein abundance. The data showed that ALA treatment promoted a dose-dependent increase of p53 expression, downregulation of Bcl-2, HMG-CoA reductase and OGG1 and an increase in lipoperoxidation. There was no alteration in the expression of the transcription factor NF-κB, catalase and superoxide dismutase. ALA oxidation products induced protein regulation patterns, suggesting the interconnection of cellular processes, such as the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, redox homeostasis, cell proliferation, lipid metabolism and DNA repair. This study helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hepatotoxicity mediated by ALA pro-oxidant effects and supports the hypothesis that ALA accumulation correlates with a higher incidence of hepatic carcinogenic events.'

OCC-1 and APPL2 neighboring genes located in 12q.23.3 human chromosome region are related to colorectal cancer. Here, we intended to investigate OCC-1 newly reported transcript variants and APPL2 gene expression alteration in breast cancer specimens and investigate OCC-1 variants overexpression effect on APPL2 and on cell cycle status. Rt-qPCR analysis indicated that the expression level of OCC-1A/B and OCC-1D (not OCC-1C) transcript variants has been increased while, APPL2 gene expression level has been decreased in breast cancer specimen, compared to their normal pairs. Therefore, a negative correlation of expression is evident between APPL2 and OCC-1 genes in breast cancer specimen. Unlike OCC-1A/B which encodes a small protein, OCC-1D noncoding RNA overexpression lead to APPL2 downregulation in MCF7 cells. Consistently, OCC-1D overexpression resulted in increased sub-G1 cell population in MCF7 cells, detected by flow cytometry. Altogether, these results suggest that OCC1-D variant have an inhibitory effect on APPL2 expression and may regulate the cell cycle status.'

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various pathophysiologic processes in osteoblast, but the role of miRNAs in the PBMT-based promotion of osteoblast proliferation remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PBMT treatment (3.75\xa0J/cm) on mouse pre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 proliferation and apoptosis via the miR-503/Wnt3a pathway; meanwhile, detect the expressions of miR-503 and Wnt3a after PBMT treatment and the role of miR-503 in regulating Wnt signaling molecules Wnt3a, β-catenin, Runx2, apoptotic proteins caspase-3, and Bcl-2 in vitro. The PBMT parameters were as follows: 808\xa0nm continuous wavelength, 0.401\xa0W output power, 0.042\xa0W/cm power density, 9.6\xa0cm spot size, 36\xa0J energy, 3.75\xa0J/cm energy density, 90\xa0s irradiation for three times per 12\xa0h, 14.5\xa0cm distance of the laser source and the angle of divergence of the laser beam was 7°. In our present study, the target relationship was predicted and verified by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Gene mRNA and protein expressions were examined by qPCR and western blot analysis. The MTT method was used to evaluate the effect of miR-503 on MC3T3-E1 cells proliferation. And cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The results showed that PBMT treatment reduced the expression of miR-503 and increased the level of Wnt3a (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Wnt3a was a target of miR-503, and Wnt3a was regulated by miR-503. Furthermore, miR-503 was found to functionally inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis (p\u2009<\u20090.01). And during this process, Wnt3a, β-catenin, Runx2, and Bcl-2 expressions were significantly inhibited (p\u2009<\u20090.01); however, caspase-3 level was upregulated (p\u2009<\u20090.01). These results suggest that miR-503 plays a role in osteoblast proliferation and apoptosis in response to PBMT, which is potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation for clinical application.'

However, irregular bearing attributed to unstable flowering is a major ongoing problem for litchi producers. Previous studies indicate that low-temperature is a key factor in litchi floral induction. In order to reveal the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive process in litchi, we had analyzed the transcriptome of buds before and after low-temperature induction using RNA-seq technology. A key flower bud differentiation associated gene, a homologue of FLORICAULA/LEAFY, was identified and named LcLFY (GenBank Accession No. KF008435). The cDNA sequence of LcLFY encodes a putative protein of 388 amino acids. To gain insight into the role of LcLFY, the temporal expression level of this gene was measured by real-time RT-PCR. LcLFY was highly expressed in flower buds and its expression correlated with the floral developmental stage. Heterologous expression of LcLFY in transgenic tobacco plants induced precocious flowering. Meantime, we investigated the sub-cellular localization of LcLFY. The LcLFY-Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was found in the nucleus. The results suggest that LcLFY plays a pivotal role as a transcription factor in controlling the transition to flowering and in the development of floral organs in litchi.'

The selectable markers used were the genes for hygromycin resistance under the control of the polyubquitin promoter from M. importuna. The reporter genes were those for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the β-Glucuronidase (GUS) under the control of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and polyubquitin promoter respectively. The presence of the reporter gene EGFP in the transformants was confirmed by the fluorescence and confocal microscope and molecular analysis and that of the reporter gene GUS was verified by enzyme activity and molecular analysis. The analysis results of both reporter genes indicated that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was successfully performed in M. importuna.'

Disseminated\xa0cancer cells display the characteristics of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition events. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) as a novel biomarker for CTC retrieval in breast cancer.\n\nMETHODS: MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with either anti-EpCAM or anti-EMP2 mAbs, respectively, followed by flow cytometric assay to measure their expression levels. PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were used for breast cancer cell spiking. CD45-depleted PBMCs from breast cancer patients' blood were used for CTC capturing. Immunomagnetic separation was used to enrich breast cancer cells. Cytospin\xa0centrifugation was performed to concentrate the captured cells, followed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-CD45 mAb, anti-pan cytokeratin mAb and DAPI. Fluorescent images were taken using a confocal microscope for CTC counts.\n\nRESULT: MDA-MB-231 cells had 2.56 times higher EMP2 expression than MCF7 cells, and EMP2 had a significantly higher capture efficiency than EpCAM for MCF7 cells. Furthermore, anti-EMP2 was capable of capturing MCF7 cells that escaped in the flow-through of anti-EpCAM. Likewise, EMP2 had a significantly higher capture efficiency on MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to MCF7 cells. Most importantly, EMP2 biomarker was successfully used for CTC capture in patients with primary breast cancer.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: EMP2 is superior to EpCAM for capturing both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, EMP2 is a novel biomarker and capable of capturing breast cancer cells in patient blood samples."""
30218300	2018	'Detection of minute quantities of target antigens in serum samples (consisting of a mixture of proteins/biomolecules) can be achieved by enhancement of the capture efficiencies of heterogeneous immunosensors. An important process parameter which affects the capture of target analytes in such immunosensors is the pH of the solution as the target proteins present in the serum samples are charged molecules. Here, we investigated the capture of prostate-specific antigens (PSAs), first in a mixed-analyte system wherein the solution contained two other non-specific proteins along with the target analyte, using the surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. There are no reports on the detection of antigens in a mixed system based on the optimization of the pH values of the carrier fluid, and this is the motivation of the present work. Further, we studied interference effects caused by the presence of these non-specific proteins in the mixed-analyte systems by artificially increasing the ratio of the interfering proteins to that of the target protein. Eventually PSA spiked into the rabbit serum samples was captured through the optimization of the pH of the solution. We could detect PSA in the serum samples when diluted to 100 times or more, where the amounts of other interfering proteins were ~\u200966 times that of the amount of PSA. This study proposes a heterogeneous immunosensor to detect the target analytes in the diluted serum samples by tuning pH the of solution mixture, which can be utilized to detect disease biomarkers in serum samples.'

The recombinant enzyme encoded a protein of 598 amino acids with a molecular mass of 66\xa0kDa. Gel filtration showed that ACTS is a tetramer in sodium phosphate buffer. The enzyme was metal ion independent and exhibited maximal activity in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 30\xa0°C.

30218292	2018	"""We used green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus (PLDMV-GFP) to track PLDMV infection by fluorescence. The virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) of PLDMV-GFP were characterized from papaya plants by next-generation sequencing. The foreign GFP gene inserted into the PLDMV genome was also processed as a viral gene into siRNAs by components involved in RNA silencing. The siRNAs derived from PLDMV-GFP accumulated preferentially as 21- and 22-nucleotide (nt) lengths, and most of the 5'-terminal ends were biased towards uridine (U) and adenosine (A). The single-nucleotide resolution map revealed that vsiRNAs were heterogeneously distributed throughout the PLDMV-GFP genome, and vsiRNAs derived from the sense strand were more abundant than those from the antisense strand. The hotspots were mainly distributed in the P1 and GFP coding region of the antisense strand. In addition, 979 papaya genes targeted by the most abundant 1000 PLDMV-GFP vsiRNAs were predicted and annotated using GO and KEGG classification. Results suggest that vsiRNAs play key roles in PLDMV-papaya interactions. These data on the characterization of PLDMV-GFP vsiRNAs will help to provide insight into the function of vsiRNAs and their host target regulation patterns."""

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 88 MPA patients, who were first classified and in whom medications was first initiated in our tertiary Hospital. We collected clinical and laboratory data as well as the rate of all-cause mortality. AGR at diagnosis was calculated as a ratio of serum albumin over globulin fraction (protein-albumin). We compared variables between survived and deceased patients. The multivariable Cox hazard model was conducted to appropriately obtain the hazard ratios (HRs). The mean age at diagnosis was 56.3\xa0years and 24 patients (27.3%) were men. Seven patients died for the mean follow-up period of 49.7\xa0months.

In this study, we attempted to target thrombolysis and enhance blood clot lysis by generating a construct (pLEGFP-N1-tPA) to integrate tPA gene into the genome of different cell lines. pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct was generated and used to target the tPA gene in different cell lines. The thrombolytic effects mediated by the supernatant from transfected HeLa cells and Linx cells were assessed using plasma thrombus plates. Furthermore, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), which was fused to the tPA gene in the pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct, was analyzed under the fluorescent microscope to assess tPA localization. We also monitored tPA activity and expression in the transfected cell lines. As part of the study, we successfully generated the pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct. The sequence of this construct was verified and the construct was subsequently used to generate the PT67/pLEGFP-N1-tPA cell line. The pLEGFP-N1-tPA construct was also used to transfect HeLa cells and Linx cells. We observed that supernatants from transfected cells were capable of lysing thrombi. In addition, tPA activity and tPA concentration were elevated in the latter supernatants and tPA was rapidly and stably expressed in the transfected cell lines.

30218258	2018	'The unicellular photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was propagated in iron deficiency medium and patterns of growth, photosynthetic efficiency, lipid accumulation, as well as the expression of lipid biosynthetic and photosynthesis-related proteins were analysed and compared with iron-sufficient growth conditions. As expected, the photosynthetic rate was reduced (maximally after 4\xa0days of growth) as a result of increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Surprisingly, the stress-response protein LHCSR3 was expressed in conditions of iron deficiency that cause NPQ induction. In addition, the protein contents of both the PSI and PSII reaction centres were gradually reduced during growth in iron deficiency medium. Interestingly, the two generations of Fe deficiency cells could be able to recover the photosynthesis but the second generation cells recovered much slower as these cells were severely in shock. Analysis by flow cytometry with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and thin layer chromatography showed that iron deficiency also induced the accumulation of triacylglycerides (TAG), which resulted in the formation of lipid droplets. This was most significant between 48 and 72\xa0h of growth. Dramatic increases in DGAT2A and PDAT1 levels were caused by iron starvation, which indicated that the biosynthesis of TAG had been increased. Analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry showed that levels of 16:0, 18:0, 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids were significantly elevated. The results of this study highlight the genes/enzymes of Chlamydomonas that affect lipid synthesis through their influence on photosynthesis, and these represent potential targets of metabolic engineering to develop strains for biofuel production.'
30218238	2018	'BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestations of skin fibrosis are very variable and ambiguous, making its management quite critical and challenging. The lack of appropriate established pharmacological interventions make its treatment even more complicated. Intricate details of the underlying pathogenesis are thus imperative to further explore different treatment possibilities. Of note, the TGF-β/Smad signaling axis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are the principal offenders in this fibrotic disorder.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Our current study is aimed at demonstrating the antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory potential of nimbolide, a triterpene derived from Indian traditional plant neem, in a murine model of Bleomycin-induced scleroderma.\n\nMETHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with Bleomycin injections subcutaneously, daily for 28\xa0days, at a constant site on the dorsum of the mice. Treatment with nimbolide lasted from day 1 to day 28. At the time of study termination, the injected sites were collected and stored suitably to conduct further molecular experiments and protein expression studies.\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that nimbolide can significantly intervene in the TGF-β/Smad signaling axis and the consequent EMT process, thus attenuating deposition of extracellular matrix. Nimbolide also profoundly caused the regression of established inflammation-driven fibrosis, thus demonstrating both antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities. Another commendable finding of this study is that nimbolide was able to decrease the levels of LOXL2, a collagen cross-linker, which is aberrantly expressed in scleroderma. Although further mechanistic studies are required, our study displays nimbolide for the first time as a potent antifibrotic agent which can be used as a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of scleroderma.'
30218207	2018	"""Periodontal diseases are a major public health problem affecting over half of the adult population worldwide. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by the periodontopathic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines that promote inflammatory bone destruction. Mounting evidence supports that periodontal diseases are involved in the onset and progression of several systemic diseases, such as aspiration pneumonia and diabetes. Although treatment of periodontal diseases by removing the periodontopathic bacteria by brushing is a standard practice, it has limitations and is not effective in all cases. Therefore, a new method to replace or complement brushing is needed for the treatment of periodontal diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of an extract from Cynara scolymus L. and its pharmacologically effective compound cynaropicrin, a sesquiterpene lactone, on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) stimulated by LPS and the potential anti-osteoclastogenic effects on RAW264.7 cells induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). We found that cynaropicrin inhibited IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA and protein synthesis in LPS-stimulated HGFs in a dose-dependent manner. P. gingivalis LPS-induced degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 were also suppressed by cynaropicrin, as was LPS-stimulated NF-κB transactivation. Thus, cynaropicrin's inhibition of P. gingivalis LPS-induced IL-8 and IL-6 expression may be due to the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we showed that cynaropicrin dramatically reduced RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. These results suggest that cynaropicrin may be useful for preventing periodontal diseases and could prove valuable in the development of more effective preventative approaches for periodontal diseases."""

For the binding affinity/free energy prediction, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes in explicit water solvent with counter ions, and then estimated the binding free energies with our newly developed model of extended linear interaction energy (ELIE), which is inspired by two other popular end-point approaches: the linear interaction energy\xa0(LIE) method, and the molecular mechanics with Poisson-Boltzmann surface area solvation method\xa0(MM/PBSA). Our studies suggest that ELIE is a good trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, and it is appropriate for filling the gap between the high-throughput docking and scoring methods and the rigorous but much more computationally demanding methods like free energy perturbation\xa0(FEP) or thermodynamics integration\xa0(TI) in computer-aided drug design (CADD)\xa0projects.'
30218196	2018	"""PURPOSE: Most patients undergoing bariatric surgery (BS) are fertile women whose postoperative (post-op) hormonal balance and weight loss increases fertility, frequently leading to pregnancy. This study aims to analyze supplementation adherence of pregnant women after BS and perinatal outcomes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed records from women after BS who consulted nutritionists at least twice during pregnancy. Each patient received nutritional guidance about vitamin and mineral supplementation and protein intake. Demographic data, body mass index (BMI), percentage of weight loss (%WL) at conception, maximum post-op BMI and %WL, post-op time at conception, supplementation adherence, biochemical data, possible gestational complications, and infant's birth weight were collected.\n\nRESULTS: Data was obtained from 23 women (mean age 33\u2009±\u20094\xa0years). On average, patients became pregnant 43\xa0months after surgery. The mean preoperative BMI was 40.2\xa0kg/m, the maximum post-op %WL was 36.6%, and the mean %WL at conception was 32.0%. No gestational intercurrence was related to biochemical data. Supplementation adherence was 34.7% for one multivitamin and 34.7% for two multivitamins; 43.5% for iron, 43.5% for omega 3, 39.1% for folic acid, 17.4% for B complex, and 60.8% for calcium. Mean infant birth weight was 3.0\xa0kg, and it was not associated with maximum %WL, % WL at conception, and time since BS at conception.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our data indicate satisfactory adherence to post-op micronutrient supplementation and few gestational complications following BS. Moreover, child's birth weight was not associated with maximum %WL, %WL at conception, or time since BS."""
30218176	2018	'We used the double-agar layer method to isolate a novel Marinobacter marina bacteriophage, B23, from the surface water sample of the Bohai sea of China. There is some work to better understand the phage. The result of transmission electron microscopy revealed that B23 belongs to the family Siphoviridae with a head of 80\xa0nm in diameter and a tail of 230\xa0nm. Microbiological characterization evidenced that phage B23 is stable at the temperatures from -\u200925 to 60\xa0°C, and showed vigorous vitality at pH between 4.0 and 12.0. One-step growth experiment showed that it had a longer latent period and higher lysis efficiency. Furthermore, the complete genome of B23 was sequenced and analyzed, which consists of a 35132\xa0bp DNA with a G\u2009+\u2009C content of 59.8% and 50 putative open reading frames. The genome was divided into five parts, consisting of DNA replication and regulation, phage packaging, phage structure, host lysis and hypothetical protein.'
30218158	2018	'Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) are gram-negative bacteria responsible for bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) in humans, which is characterized by invasion and inflammatory destruction of the human colonic epithelium. Different EIEC and Shigella subgroups rose independently from commensal E. coli through patho-adaptive evolution that included loss of functional genes interfering with the virulence and/or with the intracellular lifestyle of the bacteria, as well as acquisition of genetic elements harboring virulence genes. Among the latter is the large virulence plasmid encoding for a type three secretion system (T3SS), which enables translocation of virulence proteins (effectors) from the bacterium directly into the host cell cytoplasm. These effectors enable the pathogen to subvert epithelial cell functions, promoting its own uptake, replication in the host cytosol, and dissemination to adjacent cells while concomitantly inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell death. Furthermore, T3SS effectors are directly involved in Shigella manipulation of immune cells causing their dysfunction and promoting cell death. In the current chapter, we first describe the evolution of the enteroinvasive pathovars and then summarize the overall knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of these bacteria, with a particular focus on Shigella flexneri. Subversion of host cell functions in the human gut, both epithelial and immune cells, by different virulence factors is especially highlighted.'
30218154	2018	'PURPOSE: While the elastin-specific crosslinks, desmosine and isodesmosine (DID), are increased in blood, urine, and sputum of patients with clinically documented pulmonary emphysema, the usefulness of DID in detecting early lung injury remains untested. To this end, our laboratory has measured DID in a hamster model of smoke-induced emphysema, involving only minimal alveolar wall damage.\n\nMETHODS: Animals were either treated with cigarette smoke for 2\xa0h/day, 5 days/week, or exposed only to room air (controls) for a period of 3\xa0months. DID levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and whole lungs were determined at monthly intervals, using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Lung surface area was also determined, as a measure of airspace enlargement.\n\nRESULTS: The portion of BALF DID not bound to peptides (free DID) was significantly higher in smoke-exposed animals at 2\xa0months (9.2 vs 4.4\xa0pg/mg protein; p\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas total BALF DID showed no significant increases over the course of the study, and total lung DID remained unchanged. There was a mild, but significant, loss of lung surface area in the smoke-exposed group at 2\xa0months (28.8% vs 25.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.05), which showed no further progression, consistent with the return of free DID to control levels at 3\xa0months.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that free DID are sensitive indicators of smoke-induced lung injury. Measurement of free DID in smokers with minimally decreased lung mass may help determine the utility of this parameter as a test for incipient pulmonary emphysema.'
30218151	2018	'PURPOSE: To assess the predictive ability of the maximum chemiluminescence intensity (CI) for severe neutropenia (SN) during neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy [NAC(RT)] in patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary tract cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Clinicopathological variables and blood test data before NAC(RT) were evaluated in 64 patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary tract cancer who received gemcitabine plus tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil as NAC(RT).\n\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (60.9%) developed Grade 3-4 SN. The median time between commencing NAC(RT) and the onset of SN was 15 (range 10-36) days. SN occurred during the NAC period, not the RT period. The CI, neutrophil count, serum interleukin-6 level, C-reactive protein level, complement C3 titer, serum complement titer, and 50.0% hemolytic unit of complement before NAC(RT) were significantly lower in patients with SN than in those without SN (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed the CI to be the sole independent predictor of SN (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The optimal threshold for the CI was 46,000 RLU/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 46.2% and 80.0%, respectively. Majority of the patients (81.8%) with a low CI before NAC(RT) experienced SN during NAC(RT).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CI before NAC(RT) predicts SN during NAC(RT) in patients with advanced pancreatic or biliary tract cancer.'
30218140	2018	"'PURPOSE: To determine the influence of meal composition on the glycaemic impact of different carbohydrate staples, and the accuracy of ""adjusted calculated meal GI"" compared with ""measured mixed-meal GI"".\n\nMETHODS: In a non-blind randomized crossover trial fasted healthy subjects consumed four dinner-type mixed meals of realistic serving size comprising a carbohydrate staple of either mashed potato, pasta, rice or a glucose drink, combined with fixed portions of boiled carrots, poached salmon and herb sauce. Blood samples collected between 0 and 180\xa0min were analysed for glucose and insulin concentrations. Adjusted calculated meal GI values were determined against a 50\xa0g reference glucose drink, and compared to corresponding measured mixed-meal GIs, supplemented with data from four previous mixed-meal postprandial glycaemic response studies.\n\nRESULTS: The common carbohydrate staples, and the glucose drink, ingested as part of the salmon mixed meal induced a significantly lower post-prandial relative glycaemic response (RGR) and concurrent higher relative insulin response than the same amount of staple eaten alone. Adjusted calculated mixed-meal GI closely predicted measured mixed-meal GI in healthy subjects for 15 out of 17 mixed meals examined, showing the need to account for effects of fat and protein when predicting measured mixed-meal GI. Further, we showed the validity of using customarily consumed food amounts in mixed-meal postprandial RGR study design.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjusted calculated mixed-meal GI appears a useful model to predict measured mixed-meal GI in healthy subjects and with further development and validation could aid nutrition research and rational design of healthy meals for personalized nutrition and particular consumer groups.'"
30218127	2018	'MMP-11 is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family (MMPs) which are overexpressed in cancer cells, stromal cells and the adjacent microenvironment. The MMP protein family encompasses zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM), facilitating the breakdown of the basal membrane and matrix connective tissues. This function is believed to be important in cancer development and metastasis. This paper investigated a gold nanoparticle-based immunohistochemical assay to visualise the distribution of MMP-11 in human breast cancer tissues from eight patients with and without metastases by employing laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The expression of MMP-11 was increased and more heterogeneous in metastatic specimens compared to non-metastatic tumour samples. These findings demonstrate that imaging breast tumours by LA-ICP-MS may be a useful tool to aid the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. As an example, samples of two patients are presented who were diagnosed with matching characteristics and grades of breast cancer. Although both patients had a similar prognosis and treatment, only one developed metastases.'
30218126	2018	'Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of μ-droplets is becoming an attractive alternative for detecting and quantifying elements in biological samples. With minimal sample preparation required and detection limits comparable to solution nebulisation ICP-MS, μ-droplets have substantial advantages over traditional elemental detection, particularly for low volumes, such as aliquots taken from samples required for multiple independent biochemical assays, or fluids and tissues where elements of interest exist at native concentrations not suited to the necessary dilution steps required for solution nebulisation ICP-MS. However, the characteristics of μ-droplet residue deposition are heavily dependent on the matrix, and potential effects on signal suppression or enhancement have not been fully characterised. We present a validated and flexible high-throughput method for quantification of elements in μ-droplets using LA-ICP-MS imaging and matrix-matched external calibrants. Imaging the entire μ-droplet area removes analytical uncertainty arising from the often-heterogenous distribution when compared to radial or bisecting line scans that capture only a small portion of the droplet residue. We examined the effects of common matrices found in a standard biochemistry workflow, including native protein and salt contents, as well as reagents used in typical preparation steps for concurrent biochemical assays, such as total protein quantification and enzyme activity assays. We found that matrix composition results in systemic, concentration-dependent signal enhancement and suppression for carbon, whereas high sodium content has a specific space-charge-like suppression effect on high masses. We confirmed the accuracy of our method using both a certified serum standard (Seronorm™ L1) and independent measurements of analysed samples by solution nebulisation ICP-MS, then tested the specificity and reproducibility by examining spinal cord tissue homogenates from SOD1-G93A transgenic mice with a known molecular phenotype of increased copper- and zinc-binding superoxide dismutase-1 expression and altered copper-to-zinc stoichiometry. The method presented is rapid and transferable to multiple other biological matrices and allows high-throughput analysis of low-volume samples with sensitivity comparable to standard solution nebulisation ICP-MS protocols.

30218123	2018	'A robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and comprehensively validated for the quantification of cefquinome considering the changing matrix composition from bovine colostrum to raw milk. Sample preparation consisted of addition of isotopically labeled cefquinome internal standard prior to protein precipitation of 2\xa0g colostrum or milk followed by solid-phase extraction. A wide concentration range from 1 to 5000\xa0ng cefquinome per gram of colostrum or milk was quantified using a 3200 QTRAP tandem mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode with electrospray ionization. Validation was performed according to the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC guidelines. Matrix-comprehensive in-house validation included analytical limits CC and CC, recovery, precision and calibration curves with prediction intervals, storage conditions, and evaluation of robustness based on factorial effect analysis. The detection limit was 0.2\xa0ng cefquinome per gram of colostrum or milk. Recovery was between 98.4 and 99.4% for cefquinome concentrations from 4 to 240\xa0ng/g. None of the investigated validation factors (matrix, storage of extracts, lot of SPE cartridges, and operators) exerted an influence higher than ±\u20093.2%, indicating that these factors make relatively low contributions to the respective combined measurement uncertainties. The comprehensively validated method enables routine residue control purposes and to monitor the pharmacokinetics of cefquinome in bovine colostrum and raw milk. In particular, residue depletion curves of cefquinome from high concentrations in first milking after treatment to concentrations far below the maximum residue limit can be measured.'
30218119	2018	'Timely diagnosis of coronary involvement is paramount in Kawasaki disease (KD) as it can be associated with long-term morbidity. However, echocardiographic measurements of coronary artery dilation in KD are inconsistent and not proficient for all abnormal arteries. The purpose of this study was to investigate more valuable indices and determine their sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis of coronary involvement in KD. We performed this retrospective study in 218 children. All patients underwent laboratory and echocardiographic evaluations upon admission. We measured the size of the left main coronary artery (LMA), left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), and aorta (Ao), and calculated the LMA/Ao, LAD/Ao, and RCA/Ao ratios. We also calculated the cut-off values of each index using receiver operating characteristic curves. LMA, LAD, and RCA measurements did not correlate with white blood cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or brain natriuretic peptide level. The LMA measurement was associated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron saturation. LAD/Ao was correlated with white blood cell and platelet counts (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas RCA/Ao was correlated with ferritin level (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The cut-off value of LMA/Ao was 0.2, with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 70%. Individual coronary artery/Ao ratios might provide helpful insight for detection of coronary abnormality in KD in the acute phase. Further investigation is essential to clarify prompt early diagnosis of coronary involvement in KD.'

30218108	2018	'Several polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are associated with the occurrence of chronic liver disease. Here, we investigated the association between BsmI, ApaI, TaqI and FokI VDR polymorphisms and the severity of liver cirrhosis in relation to serum cytokine and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) levels and their role on survival in cirrhotic patients. We found that patients harboring the BB genotype had higher MELD score, and they were mainly at CP stage C; patients harboring the AA genotype had increased LBP, IL-1β and IL-8 levels, and they were mostly at CP stage C; TT genotype carriers had higher MELD score and they were mainly at CP stage C and FF genotype carriers had lower IL-1β levels when compared to Bb/bb, Aa/aa, Tt/tt and Ff/ff genotypes respectively. In the multivariate analysis ApaI, BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms were independently associated with liver cirrhosis severity. In the survival analysis, the independent prognostic factors were CP score, MELD and the FF genotype. Our results indicate that the ApaI, TaqI and BsmI polymorphisms are associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis, through the immunoregulatory process. Survival is related to the FF genotype of FokI polymorphism, imparting a possible protective role in liver cirrhosis.'
30218101	2018	'The MS2 system has been widely used, in organisms ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, to image single mRNAs in intact cells with high precision. We have recently re-engineered the MS2 system for accurate detection of mRNAs in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous MS2 systems affected the degradation of the tagged mRNA, which led to accumulation of MS2 fragments and to erroneous conclusions about mRNA localization and expression. Here we describe a step-by-step protocol for the use of our latest MS2 system (MBSV6) for detecting endogenously tagged mRNAs using wide-field fluorescent microscopy in living yeast. The procedure is divided into three stages: tagging of endogenous gene with MBSV6 (~2 weeks), a two-color single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) procedure to quantitatively assess whether mRNAs tagged with MS2 and MS2-coat protein (MCP) behave like untagged mRNAs (2 d, plus additional time for quantification), and a procedure to quantify single mRNAs by live imaging using wide-field microscopy (1 d, plus additional time for quantification). With this method it is now possible to interrogate all phases of mRNA expression, from transcription through decay. The described protocol is designed for S. cerevisiae; however, we think that our approach and the considerations discussed here can be extended to Escherichia coli, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells.'
30218090	2018	"""N-methyladenosine (mA) is the most abundant internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA. This modification has previously been shown to alter the export kinetics for mRNAs though the molecular details surrounding this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Recruitment of the TREX mRNA export complex to mRNA is driven by transcription, 5' capping and pre-mRNA splicing. Here we identify a fourth mechanism in human cells driving the association of TREX with mRNA involving the mA methylase complex. We show that the mA complex recruits TREX to mA modified mRNAs and this process is essential for their efficient export. TREX also stimulates recruitment of the mA reader protein YTHDC1 to the mRNA and the mA complex influences the interaction of TREX with YTHDC1. Together our studies reveal a key role for TREX in the export of mA modified mRNAs."""
30218085	2018	'Archaeal RNA:pseudouridine-synthase (PUS) Cbf5 in complex with proteins L7Ae, Nop10 and Gar1, and guide box H/ACA sRNAs forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) catalysts that insure the conversion of uridines into pseudouridines (Ψs) in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Nonetheless, in the absence of guide RNA, Cbf5 catalyzes the in vitro formation of Ψ in Pyrococcus abyssi 23S rRNA and of Ψ in tRNAs. Using gene-disrupted strains of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis, we studied the in vivo contribution of proteins Nop10 and Gar1 to the dual RNA guide-dependent and RNA-independent activities of Cbf5 on 23S rRNA. The single-null mutants of the cbf5, nop10, and gar1 genes are viable, but display a thermosensitive slow growth phenotype. We also generated a single-null mutant of the gene encoding Pus10, which has redundant activity with Cbf5 for in vitro formation of Ψ in tRNA. Analysis of the presence of Ψs within the rRNA peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the mutants demonstrated that Cbf5 but not Pus10 is required for rRNA modification. Our data reveal that, in contrast to Nop10, Gar1 is crucial for in vivo and in vitro RNA guide-independent formation of Ψ (Ψ in P. abyssi) by Cbf5. Furthermore, our data indicate that pseudouridylation at orphan position 2589 (2585 in P. abyssi), for which no PUS or guide sRNA has been identified so far, relies on RNA- and Gar1-dependent activity of Cbf5.'

However, the mechanism underlying its anti-cancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether and how hispidulin-induced apoptosis of human HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that hispidulin (10, 20\u2009μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in human HCC SMMC7721 cells and Huh7 cells. More importantly, we revealed that its pro-apoptotic effects depended on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and unfolded protein response (UPR), as pretreatment with salubrinal, a selective ERS inhibitor, or shRNA targeting a UPR protein CHOP effectively abrogated hispidulin-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that hispidulin-induced apoptosis was mediated by activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway as pretreatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or AMPK-targeting siRNA reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of hispidulin. In HCC xenograft nude mice, administration of hispidulin (25, 50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u2009d, ip, for 27 days) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor growth, accompanied by inducing ERS and apoptosis in tumor tissue. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hispidulin induces ERS-mediated apoptosis in HCC cells via activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway. This study provides new insights into the anti-tumor activity of hispidulin in HCC."""
30218070	2018	'Microalgae have great potential for the production of biofuels due to the ability of the organism to accumulate large quantities of storage lipids under stress conditions. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are widely recognized for their role in stress response signal transduction in eukaryotes. To assess the correlation between MAPK activation and lipid productivity, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was studied under various concentrations of NaCl. The results demonstrated that C. reinhardtii exhibits elevated levels of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activities after undergoing osmotic stress, as well as an increase in cellular lipid content. To establish a more direct causal link between both kinases and lipid productivity, C. reinhardtii was subjected to biochemically induced regulation of ERK and JNK pathways. Activating the MEK-ERK pathway via C6 ceramide treatment increased ERK activation and lipid production simultaneously, while PD98059 mediated inhibition of the pathway yielded opposite results. Interestingly, suppression of the JNK pathway with SP600125 resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability under osmotic stress. These results suggest that ERK and JNK MAP kinases have important roles in microalgal lipid accumulation and cell growth under osmotic stress, respectively.'
30218069	2018	'Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that catalyses the O-methylation, and thereby the inactivation, of catechol-containing molecules. In humans, it has been suggested that COMT modulates cognitive ability, possibly by regulating degradation of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. Hence, it is significant that two COMT SNPs, rs4680 (c.472\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A, p.Val158Met) and rs4818 (c.408\u2009C\u2009>\u2009G), have been associated with cognitive ability in humans. We have shown these SNPs to be associated with levels of muscarinic M1 receptor mRNA in human cortex, which is significant as that receptor also regulates cognitive ability. We decided to determine if COMT genotype was associated with varying levels of COMT protein, as this could be a mechanism by which COMT genotype could be associated with changes in muscarinic M1 receptor mRNA levels. Hence, we measured COMT levels in prefrontal cortex obtained postmortem from 199 subjects, some of whom had a history of schizophrenia, major depressive disorders or bipolar disorders. Our data show, independent of diagnostic status, that genotype at rs4680 and rs4818, but not at rs737865 and rs165599, is associated with differing levels of soluble COMT (S-COMT), but not membrane-bound COMT (MB-COMT). These findings suggest that the association between COMT polymorphisms and cognitive functioning could be, at least in part, due to their association with varying levels of S-COMT. This is important as, unlike MB-COMT, the substrates targeted by S-COMT are likely to be intra-cellular rather than, like dopamine, located mainly in the synaptic vesicles or the extra-cellular space.'
30218067	2018	'Autophagy, a conserved membrane trafficking process, sequesters cytoplasmic components into autophagosomes and targets them for lysosomal degradation. The TNF receptor Fn14 participates in multiple intracellular signaling pathways and is strongly induced upon tissue injury and solid tumorigenesis. While Fn14 is a short-lived protein, the regulation of its levels is largely obscure. Here we uncover a role for autophagy in Fn14 turnover, wherein specific core autophagy Atg8 proteins play distinct roles: Fn14 accumulates in the ERGIC in absence of GABARAP but within endosomes in the vicinity of autophagic membranes in absence of GATE-16. Moreover, GABARAP regulates overall cellular levels of Fn14, whereas GATE-16 regulates TWEAK signaling by Fn14 and thereby NF-κB activity. These findings not only implicate different Atg8 proteins in distinct roles within the mechanism of selective autophagic regulation of Fn14, but may also provide a more general view of their role in mediating autophagosome biogenesis from different membrane sources.'

It was recently found that enhancement of chondroclasts and suppression in Treg cell differentiation are involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Kartogenin (KGN) is a small drug-like molecule that induces chondrogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This study aimed to identify whether KGN can enhance severe pain behavior and improve cartilage repair in OA rat model. Induction of OA model was loaded by IA-injection of MIA. In the OA rat model, treatment an intra-articular injection of KGN. Pain levels were evaluated by analyzing PWL and PWT response in animals. Histological analysis and micro-CT images of femurs were used to analyze cartilage destruction. Gene expression was measured by real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry was analyzed to detect protein expression. KGN injection significantly decreased pain severity and joint destruction in the MIA-induced OA model. KGN also increased mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in OA patients' chondrocytes stimulated by IL-1β. Decreased chondroclast expression, and increased Treg cell expression. KGN revealed therapeutic activity with the potential to reduce pain and improve cartilage destruction. Thus, KGN could be a therapeutic molecule for OA that inhibits cartilage damage."""
30218035	2018	'RAW 264.7 cells and HUVECs were compared to evaluate the effects of dialyzed coffee extract (DCE) and artificial coffee (AC). Immunoprecipitation high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) showed DCE-2.5- (equivalent to 2.5 cups of coffee a day) and DCE-5-induced protein expression that was beneficial to human health, i.e., they led to significant increases in proliferation-, immunity-, cellular protection-, antioxidant signaling-, and osteogenesis-related proteins but decreases in inflammation-, NFkB signaling-, cellular apoptosis-, and oncogenic signaling-related proteins in RAW 264.7 cells, and slight decreases in angiogenesis-related proteins in HUVECs. These protein expression changes were less frequently observed for DCE-10 treatment, while AC treatment induced very different changes in protein expression. We suggest that the favorable cellular effects of DCE were derived from minor coffee elements that were absent in AC, and that the reduced effects of DCE-10 compared with those of DCE-2.5 or DCE-5 might have been caused by greater adverse reactions to caffeine and chlorogenic acid in DCE-10 than DCE-2.5 or DCE-5. IP-HPLC results suggested that minor coffee elements in DCE might play beneficial roles in the global protein expression of proliferation-, immunity-, anti-inflammation-, cell protection-, antioxidant-, anti-apoptosis-, anti-oncogenesis-, and osteogenesis-related proteins in RAW 264.7 cells and enhance anti-angiogenic signaling in HUVECs.'
30218034	2018	'Helicases are molecular engines which translocate along nucleic acids (NA) to unwind double-strands or remodel NA-protein complexes. While they have an essential role in genome structure and expression, the rules dictating their processivity remain elusive. Here, we developed single-molecule methods to investigate helicase binding lifetime on DNA. We found that UPF1, a highly processive helicase central to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), tightly holds onto NA, allowing long lasting action. Conversely, the structurally similar IGHMBP2 helicase has a short residence time. UPF1 mutants with variable grip on DNA show that grip tightness dictates helicase residence time and processivity. In addition, we discovered via functional studies that a decrease in UPF1 grip impairs NMD efficiency in vivo. Finally, we propose a three-state model with bound, sliding and unbound molecular clips, that can accurately predict the modulation of helicase processivity.'
30218021	2018	'Malaria has provided a major selective pressure and has modulated the genetic diversity of the human genome. The variants of the Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) gene have probably been selected by malaria parasites, particularly the FY*O allele, which is fixed in sub-Saharan Africa and confers resistance to Plasmodium vivax infection. Here, we showed the influence of genomic ancestry on the distribution of DARC genotypes in a highly admixed Brazilian population and confirmed the decreased susceptibility of the FY*A/FY*O genotype to clinical P. vivax malaria. FY*B/FY*O individuals were associated with a greater risk of developing clinical malaria. A remarkable difference among DARC variants concerning the susceptibility to clinical malaria was more evident for individuals who were less exposed to malaria, as measured by the time of residence in the endemic area. Additionally, we found that DARC-negative and FY*A/FY*O individuals had a greater chance of acquiring high levels of antibodies against the 19-kDa C-terminal region of the P. vivax merozoite surface protein-1. Altogether, our results provide evidence that DARC polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to clinical P. vivax malaria and influence the naturally-acquired humoral immune response to malaria blood antigens, which may interfere with the efficacy of a future vaccine against malaria.'
30218018	2018	'Combining anti-cancer agents in cancer therapies is becoming increasingly popular due to improved efficacy, reduced toxicity and decreased emergence of resistance. Here, we test the hypothesis that dietary agents such as\xa0oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and curcumin cooperatively modulate cancer-associated cellular mechanisms to inhibit carcinogenesis. By a series of in vitro assays in colorectal cancer cell lines, we showed that the anti-tumorigenic properties of the OPCs-curcumin combination were superior to the effects of individual compounds. By RNA-sequencing based gene-expression profiling in six colorectal cancer cell lines, we identified the cooperative modulation of key cancer-associated pathways such as DNA replication and cell cycle pathways. Moreover, several pathways, including protein export, glutathione metabolism and porphyrin metabolism were more effectively modulated by the combination of OPCs and curcumin. We validated genes belonging to these pathways, such as HSPA5, SEC61B, G6PD, HMOX1 and PDE3B to be cooperatively modulated by the OPCs-curcumin combination. We further confirmed that the OPCs-curcumin combination more potently suppresses colorectal carcinogenesis and modulated expression of genes identified by RNA-sequencing in mice xenografts and in colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids. Overall, by delineating the cooperative mechanisms of action of OPCs and curcumin, we make a case for the clinical co-administration of curcumin and OPCs as a treatment therapy for patients with colorectal cancer.'
30218014	2018	'Inorganic phosphate (P) is essential for signal transduction and cell metabolism, and is also an essential structural component of the extracellular matrix of the skeleton. P is sensed in bacteria and yeast at the plasma membrane, which activates intracellular signal transduction to control the expression of P transporters and other genes that control intracellular P levels. In multicellular organisms, P homeostasis must be maintained in the organism and at the cellular level, requiring an endocrine and metabolic P-sensing mechanism, about which little is currently known. This Review will discuss the metabolic effects of P, which are mediated by P transporters, inositol pyrophosphates and SYG1-Pho81-XPR1 (SPX)-domain proteins to maintain cellular phosphate homeostasis in the musculoskeletal system. In addition, we will discuss how P is sensed by the human body to regulate the production of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), parathyroid hormone and calcitriol to maintain serum levels of P in a narrow range. New findings on the crosstalk between iron and P homeostasis in the regulation of FGF23 expression will also be outlined. Mutations in components of these metabolic and endocrine phosphate sensors result in genetic disorders of phosphate homeostasis, cardiomyopathy and familial basal ganglial calcifications, highlighting the importance of this newly emerging area of research.'
30218010	2018	'Tau is a Microtubule-associated protein that induces and stabilizes the formation of the Microtubule cytoskeleton and plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases. The Microtubules binding region of Tau has been determined for a long time but where and how Tau binds to its partner still remain a topic of debate. We used Site Directed Spin Labeling combined with EPR spectroscopy to monitor Tau upon binding to either Taxol-stabilized MTs or to αβ-tubulin when Tau is directly used as an inducer of MTs formation. Using maleimide-functionalized labels grafted on the two natural cysteine residues of Tau, we found in both cases that Tau remains highly flexible in these regions confirming the fuzziness of Tau:MTs complexes. More interestingly, using labels linked by a disulfide bridge, we evidenced for the first time thiol disulfide exchanges between αβ-tubulin or MTs and Tau. Additionally, Tau fragments having the two natural cysteines or variants containing only one of them were used to determine the role of each cysteine individually. The difference observed in the label release kinetics between preformed MTs or Tau-induced MTs, associated to a comparison of structural data, led us to propose two putative binding sites of Tau on αβ-tubulin.'
30218007	2018	'The effects of different amino acid (AA) supplementations of milk protein-based milk replacers in pre-ruminant calves from 3 days to 7 weeks of age were studied. Animals were divided into 4 groups: Ctrl) Control group fed with milk protein-based milk replacer without supplementation; GP) supplementation with 0.1% glycine and 0.3% proline; FY) supplementation with 0.2% phenylalanine and 0.2% tyrosine; MKT) supplementation with 0.62% lysine, 0.22% methionine and 0.61% threonine. For statistical analysis, t-test was used to compare AA-supplemented animals to the Ctrl group. At week 7, body weight and average daily gain (ADG) were measured and blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken. Blood biochemistry analytes related to energy metabolism were determined and it was shown that MKT group had higher serum creatinine and higher plasma concentration of three supplemented AAs as well as arginine compared with the Ctrl group. GP group had similar glycine/proline plasma concentration compared with the other groups while in FY group only plasma phenylalanine concentration was higher compared with Control. Although the AA supplementations in the GP and FY groups did not affect average daily gain and metabolic health profile from serum, the metabolome analysis from skeletal muscle biopsy revealed several differences between the GP-FY groups and the Ctrl-MKT groups, suggesting a metabolic adaptation especially in GP and FY groups.'
30218002	2018	'Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure is one of the primary risk factors associated with the chronic mucous hypersecretion (CMH). The antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2 sustains hyperplastic mucous cells, and the airway epithelium of ex-smokers with CMH as well as mice exposed to chronic CS showed increased Bcl-2 expression. Therefore, we investigated whether Bcl-2 plays a role in CS-induced mucous expression. Primary airway epithelial cells (AECs) of murine and human origin were treated with CS extract (CSE), and there was a concentration- and time-dependent increase in secretory mucin (MUC5AC), mucous regulator (SPDEF) and Bcl-2 expression. Using differentiated human AECs cultured on air-liquid interface, EGFR and ERK1/2 pathways were interrogated. Bcl-2 activity was blocked using a small molecule BH3 mimetic ABT-263 that disrupts the Bcl-2 interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins. The ABT-263 treatment resulted in the downregulation of CSE-induced mucus expression and disrupted the EGFR-signaling while inducing the apoptosis and the pro-apoptotic protein, Bik expression. This strategy significantly suppressed the mainstream CS-induced mucous phenotype in a 3-D human airway epithelium model. Therefore, the present study suggests that CS induces Bcl-2 expression to help promote mucous cell survival; and small molecule BH3 mimetics targeting Bcl-2 could be useful in suppressing the CS-induced mucous response.'
30217997	2018	'In humans, malnutrition during pregnancy results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and an increased risk of neurological morbidities; altered miRNA characteristics have been suggested to contribute to IUGR neurological pathogenesis. A miRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed miRNA molecules in the hippocampi of rats with IUGR. Five of the molecules in question were selectively validated using real-time PCR in rats with IUGR. We then investigated the role of miR-199a-5p in hippocampal pathology. Bioinformatics analysis results suggested that TNF-α, caspase-3 and SIRT1 were potential targets of miR-199a-5p. Changes in PI3K, SIRT1 and caspase-3 protein expressions levels in the hippocampus were confirmed by Western blot analysis (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Studies using the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 cells and primary neurons demonstrated that miR-199a-5p modulated PI3K, caspase-3 and SIRT1 expression. Additionally, there was an inverse correlation between miR-199a-5p and caspase-3 expression, though dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that caspase-3 is not a target of miR-199a-5p. We conclude that IUGR affects hippocampal miRNAs characteristics. Our results also indicated that aberrantly high expression levels of miR-199a-5p may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IUGR by regulating SIRT1 and PI3K.'
30217996	2018	'Metabolic dysfunction in the liver is the cause of numerous pathologies, which are associated with an altered redox state. PASK (PAS Domain Kinase) is a nutrient and bioenergetic sensor. We contend that PASK could act as an oxidative stress sensor in liver and/or control the metabolic balance, playing a role in the mitochondrial homeostasis. Using PASK-deficient mice, we observed that PASK deficiency promotes antioxidant response mechanisms: a lower production of ROS/RNS under non-fasting conditions, overexpression of genes coding to ROS-detoxifying enzymes and mitochondrial fusion proteins (MnSod Gpx, Mfn1 and Opa1), coactivator Ppargc1a, transcription factors (Pparg and FoxO3a) and deacetylase Sirt1. Also, under fasting conditions, PASK deficiency induced the overexpression of Ppargc1a, Ppara, Pparg, FoxO3a and Nrf2 leading to the overexpression of genes coding to antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, GPx, HO1 and GCLm. Additionally, inducing PINK1 involved in cell survival and mitophagy. These changes kept ROS steady levels and improved the regenerative state. We suggest a new role for PASK as a controller of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics in the liver. In fact, antioxidant response is PASK dependent. PASK-targeting could therefore be a good way of reducing the oxidative stress in order to prevent or treat liver diseases.'
30217993	2018	'Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stromal/stem\xa0cells (UCB-MSCs) and umbilical cord matrix MSCs (UCM-MSCs) have chondrogenic potential and are alternative sources to standard surgically derived bone marrow or adipose tissue collection for cartilage engineering. However, the majority of comparative studies explore neonatal MSCs potential only on ISCT benchmark assays accounting for some bias in the reproducibility between in vitro and in clinical studies. Therefore, we characterized equine UCB-MSCs and UCM-MSCs and investigated with particular attention their chondrogenesis potential in 3D culture with BMP-2\u2009+\u2009TGF-ß1 in normoxia or hypoxia. We carried out an exhaustive characterization of the extracellular matrix generated by both these two types of MSCs after the induction of chondrogenesis through evaluation of hyaline cartilage, hypertrophic and osteogenic markers (mRNA, protein and histology levels). Some differences in hypoxia sensitivity and chondrogenesis were observed. UCB-MSCs differentiated into chondrocytes express an abundant, dense and a hyaline-like cartilage matrix. By contrast, despite their expression of cartilage markers, UCM-MSCs failed to express a relevant cartilage matrix after chondrogenic induction. Both MSCs types also displayed intrinsic differences at their undifferentiated basal status, UCB-MSCs expressing higher levels of chondrogenic markers whereas UCM-MSCs synthesizing higher amounts of osteogenic markers. Our results suggest that UCB-MSCs should be preferred for ex-vivo horse cartilage engineering. How those results should be translated to in vivo direct cartilage regeneration remains to be determined through dedicated study.'
30217992	2018	'While protein concentrations are physiologically most relevant, measuring them globally is challenging. mRNA levels are easier to measure genome-wide and hence are typically used to infer the corresponding protein abundances. The steady-state condition (assumption that protein levels remain constant) has typically been used to calculate protein concentrations, as it is mathematically convenient, even though it is often not satisfied. Here, we propose a method to estimate genome-wide protein abundances without this assumption. Instead, we assume that the system returns to its baseline at the end of the experiment, which is true for cyclic phenomena (e.g. cell cycle) and many time-course experiments. Our approach only requires availability of gene expression and protein half-life data. As proof-of-concept, we predicted proteome dynamics associated with the budding yeast cell cycle, the results are available for browsing online at http://dynprot.cent.uw.edu.pl/ . The approach was validated experimentally by verifying that the predicted protein concentration changes were consistent with measurements for all proteins tested. Additionally, if proteomic data are available as well, we can also infer changes in protein half-lives in response to posttranslational regulation, as we did for Clb2, a post-translationally regulated protein. The predicted changes in Clb2 abundance are consistent with earlier observations.'
30217988	2018	'The upper airway - which consists mainly of the naso- and oro-pharynx - is the first point of contact between the respiratory system and microbial organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment. It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n\u2009=\u20096) and B (n\u2009=\u20094) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n\u2009=\u200983). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3\u2009h and 6\u2009h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway. We have developed a sensitive systems-level proteomic assay for the systematic quantification of naso-oro-pharyngeal proteins. The assay will advance mechanistic studies of respiratory pathology, by providing an untargeted and hypothesis-free approach of examining the airway proteome.'
30217974	2018	"""In mammalian cells, one-third of all polypeptides are transported into or across the ER membrane via the Sec61 channel. While the Sec61 complex facilitates translocation of all polypeptides with amino-terminal signal peptides (SP) or transmembrane helices, the Sec61-auxiliary translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex supports translocation of only a subset of precursors. To characterize determinants of TRAP substrate specificity, we here systematically identify TRAP-dependent precursors by analyzing cellular protein abundance changes upon TRAP depletion using quantitative label-free proteomics. The results are validated in independent experiments by western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and complementation analysis. The SPs of TRAP clients exhibit above-average glycine-plus-proline content and below-average hydrophobicity as distinguishing features. Thus, TRAP may act as SP receptor on the ER membrane's cytosolic face, recognizing precursor polypeptides with SPs of high glycine-plus-proline content and/or low hydrophobicity, and triggering substrate-specific opening of the Sec61 channel through interactions with the ER-lumenal hinge of Sec61α."""
30217973	2018	'The selective removal of undesired or damaged mitochondria by autophagy, known as mitophagy, is crucial for cellular homoeostasis, and prevents tumour diffusion, neurodegeneration and ageing. The pro-autophagic molecule AMBRA1 (autophagy/beclin-1 regulator-1) has been defined as a novel regulator of mitophagy in both PINK1/PARKIN-dependent and -independent systems. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 as a key inducing factor in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy, a process that takes place independently of the main mitophagy receptors. Furthermore, we show that mitophagy function of AMBRA1 is post-translationally controlled, upon HUWE1 activity, by a positive phosphorylation on its serine 1014. This modification is mediated by the IKKα kinase and induces structural changes in AMBRA1, thus promoting its interaction with LC3/GABARAP (mATG8) proteins and its mitophagic activity. Altogether, these results demonstrate that AMBRA1 regulates mitophagy through a novel pathway, in which HUWE1 and IKKα are key factors, shedding new lights on the regulation of mitochondrial quality control and homoeostasis in mammalian cells.'
30217970	2018	'Knowing which proteins and RNAs directly interact is essential for understanding cellular mechanisms. Unfortunately, discovering such interactions is costly and often unreliable. To overcome these limitations, we developed rec-YnH, a new yeast two and three-hybrid-based screening pipeline capable of detecting interactions within protein libraries or between protein libraries and RNA fragment pools. rec-YnH combines batch cloning and transformation with intracellular homologous recombination to generate bait-prey fusion libraries. By developing interaction selection in liquid-gels and using an ORF sequence-based readout of interactions via next-generation sequencing, we eliminate laborious plating and barcoding steps required by existing methods. We use rec-Y2H to simultaneously map interactions of protein domains and reveal novel putative interactors of PAR proteins. We further employ rec-Y2H to predict the architecture of published coprecipitated complexes. Finally, we use rec-Y3H to map interactions between multiple RNA-binding proteins and RNAs-the first time interactions between protein and RNA pools are simultaneously detected.'

This study examined the pharmacological effects of 4-(5-{(1R)-1-[4-(Cyclopropylcarbonyl) phenoxy]propyl}-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-2-fluoro-N-[(2R)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl]benzamide (DS-8500a), a novel, orally available, selective GPR119 agonist. In in vitro studies, DS-8500a increased intracellular cAMP in human, rat, and mouse GPR119 expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and their 50% effective concentrations (EC50) were 51.5, 98.4, and 108.1 nmol/L, respectively. DS-8500a had no effect on intracellular cAMP in pcDNA3.1/CHO-K1 cells. In in vivo studies, DS-8500a augmented plasma GLP-1 concentration in Zucker fatty (ZF) rats, and enhanced GSIS and did not change plasma glucose concentration in fasted Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The plasma glucose lowering effects of DS-8500a at oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were demonstrated in ZF rats and neonatal streptozotpcin (nSTZ) induced diabetic rats. Single dose of DS-8500a showed dose dependent glucose lowering effects at OGTT in ZF rats. In the repeat dosing study, DS-8500a had statistically significant glucose lowering effects at OGTT performed at the first day and after 2-weeks treatment in nSTZ rats, and the efficacy levels of DS-8500a in each test were greater than those of GSK1292263 or MBX-2982 which had been clinically tested GPR119 agonists.'
30217955	2018	'Uncontrolled cell division is a hallmark of cancer. Deregulation of Wnt components has been linked to aberrant cell division by multiple mechanisms, including Wnt-mediated stabilisation of proteins signalling, which was notably observed in mitosis. Analysis of Wnt components revealed an unexpected role of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (BCL9) in maintaining mitotic Wnt signalling to promote precise cell division and growth of cancer cell. Mitotic interactome analysis revealed a mechanistic role of BCL9 in inhibiting clathrin-mediated degradation of LRP6 signalosome components by interacting with clathrin and the components in Wnt destruction complex; this function was further controlled by CDK1-driven phosphorylation of BCL9\xa0N-terminal, especially T172. Interestingly, T172 phosphorylation was correlated with cancer patient prognosis and enriched in tumours. Thus, our results revealed a novel role of BCL9 in controlling mitotic Wnt signalling to promote cell division and growth.'
30217954	2018	'Cilia, essential motile and sensory organelles, have several compartments: the basal body, transition zone, and the middle and distal axoneme segments. The distal segment accommodates key functions, including cilium assembly and sensory activities. While the middle segment contains doublet microtubules (incomplete B-tubules fused to complete A-tubules), the distal segment contains only A-tubule extensions, and its existence requires coordination of microtubule length at the nanometer scale. We show that three conserved proteins, two of which are mutated in the ciliopathy Joubert syndrome, determine the geometry of the distal segment, by controlling the positions of specific microtubule ends. FAP256/CEP104 promotes A-tubule elongation. CHE-12/Crescerin and ARMC9 act as positive and negative regulators of B-tubule length, respectively. We show that defects in the distal segment dimensions are associated with motile and sensory deficiencies of cilia. Our observations suggest that abnormalities in distal segment organization cause a subset of Joubert syndrome cases.'
30217950	2018	"""Lung cancer is associated with high prevalence and mortality, and despite significant successes with targeted drugs in genomically defined subsets of lung cancer and immunotherapy, the majority of patients currently does not benefit from these therapies. Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDPK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin's cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation."""

The serum levels of BNP, Fbg and Apelin were measured in all subjects by ELISA.\n\nRESULTS: The  rs198389 locus G allele, rs6668352 locus A allele, and 198388 locus T allele were high risk factors for COPD (  <0.001). Logistics regression analysis showed that  rs198389 locus G allele, rs6668352 locus A allele, and rs198388 locus T allele were high risk factors for PH in COPD patients (all P<0.001). The levels of the serum BNP and Fbg protein in the control group, COPD/PHgroup, and COPD/PH group increased successively, and the expression levels of Apelin protein decreased successively (all  <0.001). The BNP and Fbg protein levels in the wild-type, heterozygote, and mutant homozygote in  rs198389, rs6668352, and rs198388 loci increased successively, and the serum Apelin protein levels decreased successively (all  <0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The polymorphisms of  at the rs198389, rs6668352, and rs198388 loci are associated with the occurrence of COPD and COPD with PH, and the occurrence may be related to the abnormal expression level of BNP, Fbg, and Apelin protein in the serum.'
30217943	2018	'Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhalation on the incidence of PPCs and the outcomes of patients undergoing OLT is unknown. This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to investigate the effect of NAC inhalation during OLT on PPCs. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to the NAC group (n=30) or the control group (n=30) to receive inhaled NAC or sterilized water, respectively, for 30 min before surgery and 3 h after reperfusion. The incidence of early PPCs and outcomes including survival rate were assessed. Biomarkers including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8, Clara cell secretory protein (CC16), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) at T1 (before surgery) and T2 (at the end of operation) as well as in serum at T1, T2, T3 (12 h after operation), and T4 (24 h after operation). A total of 42 patients (20 in the NAC group and 22 in the control group) were enrolled in the final analysis. Atomization inhaled NAC significantly reduced the incidence of PPCs after OLT. The levels of TNF-α, IL-8, CC16, and ICAM-1 in EBC were significantly lower, and SOD activity was higher, at T2 in the NAC group; similar data were found in serum at T2, T3, and T4. In summary, perioperative NAC inhalation may reduce the incidence of PPCs and improve patient outcomes after OLT.'
30217930	2018	'The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a classical iodide pump typically localized within the cell plasma membrane in thyroid cells, where NIS expression is believed to ensure success of mainstay radioiodide therapy in thyroid cancers. Although radioiodide uptake is generally reduced in thyroid cancer tissue, intracellular non-membranous NIS has been reported to increase, suggesting that NIS serves a pump-independent function. Thyroid cancer is one of the major component cancers of Cowden syndrome, a subset of which is caused by germline mutations in PTEN. In this study, we explored the non-canonical tumorigenic role of NIS in thyroid cancer cells in relation to PTEN signaling. PTEN knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines stabilized intracellular NIS protein by promoting an interaction with NIS-LARG (leukemia associated RhoA guanine exchange factor). Increased protein levels of cytoplasmic NIS enhanced RhoA activation and resulted in a pro-migration tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of NIS glycosylation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contributed to mislocalization of NIS in the cytoplasm, facilitating its non-pump tumorigenic function through an interaction with LARG, which predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, PTEN or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could affect DPAGT1, a glycosylating enzyme involved in the initial step of N-linked glycosylation, to inhibit glycosylation of NIS. In summary, our results elucidate a pump-independent, pro-tumorigenic role for NIS in thyroid cancer via its crosstalk with PTEN signaling.'
30217928	2018	'Overexpression and activation of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) or nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1) oncoproteins frequently occur in pancreatic cancer. Most MDM2 inhibitors under development target MDM2-p53 binding and have little or no effect on cancers without functional p53, including pancreatic cancer. Some available compounds indirectly inhibit NFAT1 activity by interfering with calcineurin activity, but there are currently no specific inhibitors against NFAT1. Here we performed a high-throughput virtual and cell-based screening to yield a lead compound (MA242) that can directly bind both MDM2 and NFAT1 with high affinity, induce their protein degradation, and inhibit NFAT1-mediated transcription of  As a result of this binding, MA242 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines regardless of p53 status. MA242 alone or in combination with gemcitabine inhibited pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis without any host toxicity. Our data indicate that targeting both MDM2 and NFAT1 represents a novel and effective strategy to treat pancreatic cancer. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of both MDM2 and NFAT1 is a promising strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, even in tumors lacking functional p53.'
30217924	2018	'OBJECTIVES: The interaction between genetic, epigenetic inheritance and environmental factors determines susceptibility to hypertension. Previous epidemiology studies have shown that coke oven workers who are frequently exposed to various occupational hazards have remarkable increase in the risk for hypertension. Among many genetic variants identified in hypertension, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was found to play important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension and associated diseases. We therefore explore the possible role of HSP70 polymorphisms and their interaction with occupational environment in hypertension risk.\n\nMETHODS: We carried out a case-control study among 367 coke oven workers in northwest China, focused on three common HSP70 polymorphisms (HSP70-1 G190C, HSP70-2 A1267G and HSP70-hom T2437C), and evaluated the association of HSP70 gene polymorphisms with work sites for high risk of hypertension.\n\nRESULTS: The results indicated that HSP70-1 GC and CC genotype had 2.73-fold and 4.26-fold increased relative risk (95%\u2009CI 1.33 to 5.55 and 1.17 to 15.53), respectively, comparing with HSP70-1 GG genotype. HSP70-2 AG and GG conferred a 47% and 36% reduced risk (95%\u2009CI 0.23 to 0.99 and 0.14 to 0.92) comparing with HSP70-2 AA genotype. Further analysis of the interaction of HSP70 polymorphisms with occupational environment indicated a strong positive interaction between HSP70 genotype (HSP70-1 GC+CC, HSP70-2 AA and HSP70-hom TC+CC) and oven top workplace.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that HSP70 polymorphisms interact with occupational hazards might increase the risk of hypertension in coke oven workers.'
30217900	2018	"""Catalysis of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gives rise to a single product that serves as a precursor for all prostaglandins, which are central mediators of inflammation. Rapid upregulation of COX-2 expression in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli is a well-characterized means of generating the large pool of prostaglandins necessary for inflammation. However, an efficient inflammatory process must also terminate rapidly and thus requires cessation of COX-2 enzymatic activity and removal of excess protein from the cell. Previous studies showed that COX-2 that has not been exposed to AA ('naïve') degrades in the cellular proteasome. However, continuous exposure to AA induces suicide inactivation of COX-2 and its elimination no longer occurs in neither the proteasomal nor lysosomal machineries. In this study we show that either overexpressed or endogenously-induced COX-2 is secreted via exosomes through the ER-Golgi pathway. We further find that excretion of COX-2 is significantly enhanced by prolonged exposure to AA. Genetic or chemical inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity has no effect on its secretion in the absence of substrate, but prevents the additional activity-dependent secretion. Finally, transfer of COX-2 to target cells only occur in the absence of AA stimulation. Together these results suggest that exosomal secretion of AA-activated COX-2 constitutes a means to remove damaged inactive COX-2 from the cell."""
30217894	2018	'Proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to play a critical role in many physiological functions through formation of condensed liquid-like assemblies that function as membraneless organelles within biological systems. To understand how different proteins may contribute differently to these assemblies and their functions, it is important to understand the molecular driving forces of phase separation and characterize their phase boundaries and material properties. Experimental studies have shown that intrinsically disordered regions of these proteins are a major driving force, as many of them undergo LLPS in isolation. Previous work on polymer solution phase behavior suggests a potential correspondence between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that can be leveraged to discover relationships between single-molecule properties and phase boundaries. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed coarse-grained framework to calculate the θ temperature [Formula: see text], the Boyle temperature [Formula: see text], and the critical temperature [Formula: see text] for 20 diverse protein sequences, and we show that these three properties are highly correlated. We also highlight that these correlations are not specific to our model or simulation methodology by comparing between different pairwise potentials and with data from other work. We, therefore, suggest that smaller simulations or experiments to determine [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] can provide useful insights into the corresponding phase behavior.'
30217893	2018	'HIV-1 maturation occurs via multiple proteolytic cleavages of the Gag polyprotein, causing rearrangement of the virus particle required for infectivity. Cleavage results in beta-hairpin formation at the N terminus of the CA (capsid) protein and loss of a six-helix bundle formed by the C terminus of CA and the neighboring SP1 peptide. How individual cleavages contribute to changes in protein structure and interactions, and how the mature, conical capsid forms, are poorly understood. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography to determine morphology and high-resolution CA lattice structures for HIV-1 derivatives in which Gag cleavage sites are mutated. These analyses prompt us to revise current models for the crucial maturation switch. Unlike previously proposed, cleavage on either terminus of CA was sufficient, in principle, for lattice maturation, while complete processing was needed for conical capsid formation. We conclude that destabilization of the six-helix bundle, rather than beta-hairpin formation, represents the main determinant of structural maturation.'
30217892	2018	'The pathogenic strategy of  and many other gram-negative pathogens relies on the translocation of a specific set of proteins, called effectors, into the eukaryotic host cell during infection. These effectors act in concert to modulate host cell processes in favor of the invading pathogen. Injected by the type III secretion system (T3SS), the effector arsenal of enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) O157:H7 features at least eight individual NleG effectors, which are also found across diverse attaching and effacing pathogens. NleG effectors share a conserved C-terminal U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that engages with host ubiquitination machinery. However, their specific functions and ubiquitination targets have remained uncharacterized. Here, we identify host proteins targeted for ubiquitination-mediated degradation by two EHEC NleG family members, NleG5-1 and NleG2-3. NleG5-1 localizes to the host cell nucleus and targets the MED15 subunit of the Mediator complex, while NleG2-3 resides in the host cytosol and triggers degradation of Hexokinase-2 and SNAP29. Our structural studies of NleG5-1 reveal a distinct N-terminal α/β domain that is responsible for interacting with host protein targets. The core of this domain is conserved across the NleG family, suggesting this domain is present in functionally distinct NleG effectors, which evolved diversified surface residues to interact with specific host proteins. This is a demonstration of the functional diversification and the range of host proteins targeted by the most expanded effector family in the pathogenic arsenal of .'
30217891	2018	"'Viable gamete formation requires segregation of homologous chromosomes connected, in most species, by cross-overs. DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and the resulting cross-overs are regulated at multiple levels to prevent overabundance along chromosomes. Meiotic cells coordinate these events between distant sites, but the physical basis of long-distance chromosomal communication has been unknown. We show that DSB hotspots up to ∼200 kb (∼35 cM) apart form clusters via hotspot-binding proteins Rec25 and Rec27 in fission yeast. Clustering coincides with hotspot competition and interference over similar distances. Without Tel1 (an ATM tumor-suppressor homolog), DSB and crossover interference become negative, reflecting coordinated action along a chromosome. These results indicate that DSB hotspots within a limited chromosomal region and bound by their protein determinants form a clustered structure that, via Tel1, allows only one DSB per region. Such a ""roulette"" process within clusters explains the observed pattern of crossover interference in fission yeast. Key structural and regulatory components of clusters are phylogenetically conserved, suggesting conservation of this vital regulation. Based on these observations, we propose a model and discuss variations in which clustering and competition between DSB sites leads to DSB interference and in turn produces crossover interference.'"

Despite its importance for the understanding of ALL etiology, this hypothesis has been inadequately explored. In a population-based case-control study, we measured the concentrations of 10 cytokines and other inflammatory markers on neonatal dried blood spots from 178 children who at ages 1 to 9 years were diagnosed with B-cell precursor ALL and 178 matched controls. Through linkage with Danish nationwide registers, we also assessed whether neonatal inflammatory markers were associated with previously demonstrated risk factors for childhood ALL. Children who developed B-cell precursor ALL had significantly lower neonatal concentrations of IL8, soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) α, TGFβ1, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher concentrations of IL6, IL17, and IL18 compared with matched controls. Concentrations of IL10 were below the detection level for both patients and controls. Birth order (IL18 and CRP), gestational age (sIL6Rα, TGFβ1, and CRP), and sex (sIL6Rα, IL8, and CRP), but not maternal age, infections during pregnancy, birth weight nor mode of delivery were significantly associated with the neonatal concentrations of inflammatory markers. Our findings support the hypothesis that children who later develop B-cell precursor ALL are born with a dysregulated immune function. Children who develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia are immunologically distinct at birth and could potentially react abnormally to infections in early childhood. .'

A new study reveals that an unlikely protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is a heme chaperone that binds and transfers labile heme to downstream target proteins. These results provide a new framework for understanding heme homeostasis and raise intriguing questions regarding the intersection of heme transport, carbohydrate metabolism, and intracellular signaling.'
30217865	2018	"""Amino acids are attached to the tRNA 3'-end as a prerequisite for entering the ribosome for protein synthesis. Amino acid attachment also gives tRNA access to non-ribosomal cellular activities. However, the normal attachment is via an ester linkage between the carboxylic group of the amino acid and the 3'-hydroxyl of the terminal A76 ribose in tRNA. The instability of this ester linkage has severely hampered studies of aminoacyl-tRNAs. Although the use of 3'-amino-3'-deoxy A76 in a 3'-amino-tailed tRNA provides stable aminoacyl attachment via an amide linkage, there are multiple tailing protocols and the efficiency of each relative to the others is unknown. Here we compare 5 different tailing protocols in parallel, all dependent on the CCA-adding enzyme ((CTP(ATP): tRNA nucleotidyl transferase; abbreviated as the CCA enzyme) to exchange the natural ribose with the modified one. We show that the most efficient protocol is achieved by the CCA-catalyzed pyrophosphorolysis removal of the natural A76 while at the same time adding the appropriate ATP analog to synthesize the modified 3'-end. This protocol for 3'-amino-tailing affords quantitative and stable attachment of a broad range of amino acids to tRNA, indicating its general utility for studies of aminoacyl-tRNAs in both canonical and non-canonical activities."""
30217864	2018	'MgrR is an Hfq-dependent sRNA, whose transcription is controlled by the level of Mg2+ ions in Escherichia coli. MgrR belongs to Class II sRNAs because its stability in the cell is affected by mutations in Hfq differently than canonical, Class I, sRNAs. Here, we examined the effect of mutations in RNA binding sites of Hfq on the kinetics of the annealing of MgrR to two different target mRNAs, eptB and ygdQ by global data fitting of the reaction kinetics monitored by gel electrophoresis of intermediates and products. The data showed that the mutation on the rim of the Hfq ring trapped MgrR on Hfq preventing the annealing of MgrR to either mRNA. The mutation in the distal face slowed the ternary complex formation and affected the release of MgrR-mRNA complexes from Hfq, while the mutation in the proximal face weakened the MgrR binding to Hfq and in this way affected the annealing. Moreover, competition assays established that MgrR bound to both surfaces of Hfq and competed against other sRNAs. Further studies showed that uridine-rich sequences located in less structurally stable regions served as Hfq binding sites in each mRNA. Overall, the data show that the binding of MgrR sRNA to both faces of the Hfq ring enables it to efficiently anneal to target mRNAs. It also confers on MgrR a competitive advantage over other sRNAs, which could contribute to efficient cellular response to changes in magnesium homeostasis.'

Lipases potential as biocatalysts is mainly limited by denaturation in polar alcohols. In this study we focused on selected solvent tunnels in lipase from  T6 to improve its stability in methanol during biodiesel synthesis. Using rational mutagenesis, bulky aromatic residues were incorporated in order to occupy solvent channels and induce aromatic interactions leading to a better inner core packing. Each solvent tunnel was systematically analyzed with respect to its chemical and structural characteristics. Selected residues were replaced with Phe, Tyr or Trp. Overall, 16 mutants were generated and screened in 60% methanol, from which 3 variants showed elevated stability up to 81-fold compared with wild-type. All stabilizing mutations were found in the longest tunnel detected in the ""closed-lid"" x-ray structure. Combining the Phe substitutions created double mutant A187F/L360F with an increase in T of +7°C in methanol and a 3-fold increase in biodiesel synthesis yield from waste chicken oil. Kinetic analysis with -nitrophenyl laurate revealed that all mutants displayed lower hydrolysis rates ( ), though mostly their stability properties determined the transesterification capability. Seven crystal structures of different variants were solved disclosing new π-π or CH/π intramolecular interactions emphasizing the significance of aromatic interactions to improved solvent stability. This rational approach could be implemented in other enzymes for stabilization in organic solvents. Enzymatic synthesis in organic solvents holds increasing industrial opportunities in many fields, however, one major obstacle is the limited stability of biocatalysts in such a denaturing environment. Aromatic interactions play a major role in protein folding and stability and we were inspired by this to re-design enzyme voids. Rational protein engineering of solvent tunnels of lipase from  is presented here, offering a promising approach to introduce new aromatic interactions within the enzyme core. We discovered that longer tunnels leading from the surface to the enzyme active site were more beneficial targets for mutagenesis for improving lipase stability in methanol during biodiesel biosynthesis. Structural analysis of the variants confirmed the generation of new interactions involving aromatic residues.

30217851	2018	"""-dominated peatlands play an important role in global carbon storage and represent significant sources of economic and ecological value. While recent efforts to describe microbial diversity and metabolic potential of the  microbiome have demonstrated the importance of its microbial community, little is known about the viral constituents. We used metatranscriptomics to describe the diversity and activity of viruses infecting microbes within the  peat bog. The vegetative portions of 6  plants were obtained from a peatland in northern Minnesota and total RNA extracted and sequenced. Metatranscriptomes were assembled and contigs screened for the presence of conserved virus marker genes. Using bacteriophage capsid protein, gp23, as a marker for phage diversity, we identified 33 contigs representing undocumented phage s that were active in the community at the time of sampling. Similarly, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Virus (NCLDV) major capsid protein were used as markers for ssRNA viruses and NCLDV, respectively. In total 114 contigs were identified as originating from undescribed ssRNA viruses, 22 of which represent near-complete genomes. An additional 64 contigs were identified as being from NCLDVs. Finally, 7 contigs were identified as putative virophage or polinto-like viruses. We developed co-occurrence networks with these markers in relation to the expression of potential-host housekeeping gene  to predict virus-host relationships, identifying 13 groups. Together, our approach offers new tools for the identification of virus diversity and interactions in understudied clades, and suggest viruses may play a considerable role in the ecology of the  microbiome.-dominated peatlands play an important role in maintaining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by modifying conditions in the surrounding soil to favor its own growth over other plant species. This slows rates of decomposition and facilitates the accumulation of fixed carbon in the form of partially decomposed biomass. The unique environment produced by  enriches for the growth of a diverse microbial consortia that benefit from and support the moss's growth, while also maintaining the hostile soil conditions. While a growing body of research has begun to characterize the microbial groups that colonize , little is currently known about the ecological factors that constrain community structure and define ecosystem function. Top-down population control by viruses is almost completely undescribed. This study provides insight into the significant viral influence on the  microbiome, and identifying new potential model systems to study virus-host interactions in the peatland ecosystem."""
30217844	2018	'When phages infect bacteria cultured in the presence of sub-lethal doses of antibiotics, the sizes of the phage plaques are significantly increased. This phenomenon is known as phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS). In this study, the observation of PAS was extended to a wide variety of bacteria-phage pairs using different classes of antibiotics. PAS was shown in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cells stressed with β-lactam antibiotics filamented or swelled extensively, resulting in increased phage production. PAS was also sometimes observed in the presence of other classes of antibiotics with or without bacterial filamentation. The addition of antibiotics induced  expression in various bacteria, but a -deletion mutant strain of  also showed filamentation and PAS in the presence of quinolone antibiotics. The phage adsorption efficiency did not change in the presence of the antibiotics when the cell surfaces were enlarged as they filamented. Increases in production of phage DNA and mRNAs encoding phage proteins were observed in these cells, with only limited increase in protein production. The data suggest that PAS is the product of a prolonged period of particle assembly due to delayed lysis. The increase in the cell surface area far exceeded the increase in phage holin production in the filamented host cells, leading to a relatively limited availability of intracellular holins for aggregating and forming holes in the host membrane. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress also led to an increased production of phages, while heat stress only showed a limited increase in phage production.Phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) has been reported for a decade. But the underlying mechanism was never vigorously investigated. This study shows the presence of PAS from a variety of phage-bacteria-antibiotic pairs. We show that increased phage production resulted directly from lysis delay caused by relative shortage of holin supply in filamented bacterial host in the presence of sublethal concentration of stress-inducing substances like antibiotics and reactive oxygen species (ROS).'
30217842	2018	'Myxobacteria utilize the catechol natural products myxochelin A and B in order to maintain their iron homeostasis. Recently, the production of these siderophores was reported from the marine bacterium  S2040, along with a new myxochelin derivative named pseudochelin A. The latter features a characteristic imidazoline moiety, which was proposed to originate from an intramolecular condensation reaction of the β-aminoethyl amide group in myxochelin B. To identify the enzyme catalyzing this conversion, we compared the myxochelin regulons of two myxobacterial strains, which solely produce myxochelin A and B, with  S2040. This approach revealed a gene exclusive to the myxochelin regulon in  S2040, coding for an enzyme of the amidohydrolase superfamily. To prove that this enzyme is indeed responsible for the postulated conversion, the reaction was reconstituted  using a hexahistidyl-tagged recombinant protein made in  and myxochelin B as substrate. To test the production of pseudochelin A under  conditions, the amidohydrolase gene was cloned into the myxobacterial plasmid pZJY156 and placed under the control of a copper-inducible promoter. The resulting vector was introduced into the myxobacterium  DSM16526, a native producer of myxochelin A and B. Following the induction with copper, the myxobacterial expression strain was found to synthesize small quantities of pseudochelin A. Replacement of the copper-inducible promoter with the constitutive  promoter led to increased production levels in , which facilitated the isolation and subsequent structural verification of the heterologously produced compound. In this study, an enzyme for imidazoline formation in pseudochelin biosynthesis was identified. Evidence for the involvement of this enzyme in the postulated reaction was obtained after  reconstitution. Furthermore, the function of this enzyme was also demonstrated  by transferring the corresponding gene into the bacterium , which thereby became a producer of pseudochelin A. Aside from clarifying the molecular basis of imidazoline formation in siderophore biosynthesis, we describe the heterologous expression of a gene in a myxobacterium without its chromosomal integration. Due to its metabolic proficiency,  represents an interesting alternative to established host systems for the reconstitution and manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. Since the plasmid used in this study is easily adaptable for the expression of other enzymes as well, we expand the conventional expression strategy for myxobacteria, which is based on the integration of biosynthetic genes into the host genome.'

In this study, we focused on characterization of an EAL-domain protein EdpX1. Deletion of  resulted in a two-fold increase of the intracellular c-di-GMP levels, which was restored to the wild-type levels in the complemented strain Δ(pB-), demonstrating EdpX1 is an active phosphodiesterase (PDE) in Xoo. In addition, colorimetric assays further confirmed the PDE activity of EdpX1 by showing that mutation of E153A at the EAL motif strongly reduced its activity. Virulence assays on the leaves of susceptible rice showed that Δ was severely impaired in causing disease symptoms.  expression of wild-type , but not , was able to complement the weakened virulence phenotype. These results indicated that an active EAL domain is required for EdpX1 to regulate the virulence of Xoo. We then demonstrated that Δ was defective in secreting exopolysaccharide (EPS) and forming biofilm. Expression of  in Δ, but not  restored the defective phenotypes to near wild-type level. In addition, we observed that EdpX1-GFP exhibited multiple subcellular localization foci, and this pattern was dependent on its transmembrane (TM) region, which did not seem to directly contribute to the regulatory function of EdpX1. Thus, we concluded that EdpX1 exhibits PDE activity to control c-di-GMP level, and its EAL domain is necessary and sufficient for its regulation on virulence in Xoo. Bacteria utilize c-di-GMP as a second messenger to regulate various biological functions. The synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP are catalyzed by GGDEF domains and EAL or HD-GYP domains, respectively. Multiple genes encoding these domains are often found in one bacterial strain. For example, in the genome of Xoo PXO99, 26 genes encoding proteins containing these domains were identified. Therefore, to fully appreciate the complexity and specificity of c-di-GMP signaling in Xoo, the enzymatic activities and regulatory functions of each GGDEF, EAL and HD-GYP domain proteins need to be elucidated. In this study, we showed the EAL-domain protein EdpX1 is a major PDE to regulate diverse virulence phenotypes through the c-di-GMP signaling pathway.'
30217830	2018	'Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte and play a critical role in the initial response to an Ag. Recently, their ability to contribute to adaptive immunity has been highlighted. We evaluated the ability of neutrophils from blood to contribute to the adaptive immune response in a preclinical rhesus macaque SIV vaccine trial. Replication-competent adenovirus-SIV recombinants induced neutrophil activation, B cell help markers, and enhanced ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Boosting with SIV vaccines (adjuvant together with ALVAC or DNA plus envelope protein) elicited significant neutrophil responses. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels induced correlated with the frequency of neutrophil subsets expressing IL-21, myeloperoxidase, and CD64. Post-SIV infection, neutrophils exhibited dysfunction, both phenotypically and functionally. B cells from protected and infected macaques cocultured with autologous polymorphonuclear cells, consisting primarily of neutrophils, were activated, underwent class switching, and produced Abs. This B cell help was not aided by addition of IL-10 and was largely contact dependent. Numerous genes associated with inflammation, Ab production, and chemotaxis were upregulated in the cocultured B cells. We conclude that immune stimulation by vaccination or antigenic exposure imparts a greater ability of neutrophils to contribute to the adaptive immune response. Harnessing this granulocytic response has the potential to improve vaccine efficacy.'

To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 55 studies, covering more than half a billion Ab sequences across diverse immune states, organisms (primarily human and mouse), and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated, and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at http://antibodymap.org The data within OAS will be regularly updated with newly released Ig-seq datasets. We believe OAS will facilitate data mining of immune repertoires for improved understanding of the immune system and development of better biotherapeutics.'
30217827	2018	'Drought stress is a limiting environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant drought responses. Previous studies have indicated that ABA inhibits plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) activity, and the decrease in PM H+-ATPase activity promotes stomatal closure under drought stress, thereby reducing water loss. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that in Arabidopsis thaliana ABA induces an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, namely, VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 711 (VAMP711) to interact with the Arabidopsis PM H+-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The interaction occurs at their C-termini and inhibits PM H+-ATPase activity. Deletion of VAMP711 in Arabidopsis results in a higher PM H+-ATPase activity and slower stomatal closure in response to ABA and drought treatments. In addition, overexpression of VAMP711 partially rescues the drought-sensitive phenotype of ost2-2D, a mutation in AHA1 resulting in a constitutive activated PM H+-ATPase. Our results demonstrate that VAMP711 is involved in regulating ABA-mediated inhibition of PM H+-ATPase activity and stomatal closure in response to drought stress.'

In HIV-1, specific interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag protein and genomic RNA (gRNA) mediate gRNA dimerization and selective packaging; however, the mechanism for gRNA packaging in HTLV-1, a deltaretrovirus, is unclear. In other deltaretroviruses, the matrix (MA) and NC domains of Gag are both involved in gRNA packaging, but MA binds nucleic acids with higher affinity and has more robust chaperone activity, suggesting that this domain may play a primary role. Here, we show that the MA domain of HTLV-1, but not the NC domain, binds short hairpin RNAs derived from the putative gRNA packaging signal. RNA probing of the HTLV-1 5'leader and crosslinking studies revealed that the primer-binding site and a region within the putative packaging signal form stable hairpins that interact with MA. In addition to a previously identified palindromic dimerization initiation site (DIS), we identified a new DIS in HTLV-1 gRNA and found that both palindromic sequences bind specifically the NC domain. Surprisingly, a mutant partially defective in dimer formation  exhibited a significant increase in RNA packaging into HTLV-1-like particles, suggesting that efficient RNA dimerization may not be strictly required for RNA packaging in HTLV-1. Moreover, the lifecycle of HTLV-1 and other deltaretroviruses may be characterized by NC and MA functions that are distinct from those of the corresponding HIV-1 proteins, but together provide the functions required for viral replication."""

Herein, we investigated the regulation of the mTORC2 binding partner, mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSin1) in MCs derived from human lung allografts, and identified a novel role for mSin1 during fibrosis. mSin1 was identified as a common downstream target of key fibrotic pathways and its expression was increased in MCs in response to pro-fibrotic mediators - lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-13. Fibrotic-MCs had higher mSin1 protein levels than non-fibrotic MCs and siRNA-mediated silencing of m inhibited collagen I expression and mTORC1/2 activity in these cells. Autocrine LPA signaling contributed to constitutive upregulation of mSin1 in fibrotic-MCs and mSin1 was decreased due to LPA receptor 1 siRNA treatment. We identified c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as a key intermediary in mSin1 upregulation by the pro-fibrotic mediators, as pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of JNK prevented the LPA-induced mSin1 increase. Proteasomal inhibition rescued mSin1 levels after JNK inhibition in LPA-treated MCs, and decrease in mSin1 ubiquitination in response to LPA was counteracted by JNK inhibitors. Constitutive JNK1 overexpression induced mSin1 expression and could drive mTORC2 and mTORC1 activation, and collagen I expression in non-fibrotic MCs; effects that were reversed by siRNA-mediated mSIN1 silencing. These results indicate that LPA stabilizes mSin1 protein expression via JNK signaling by blocking its proteasomal degradation and identify the LPA/JNK/mSin1/mTORC/collagen I pathway as critical for fibrotic activation of MCs.'
30217821	2018	'G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded DNA structures comprising stacks of four guanines, are prevalent in genomes, and have diverse biological functions in various chromosomal structures. A conserved protein, Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), binds to Rif1-binding sequence (Rif1BS) and regulates DNA replication timing. Rif1BS is characterized by the presence of multiple G-tracts, often on both strands, and their unusual spacing. Although previous studies have suggested generation of G4-like structures on duplex Rif1BS, its precise molecular architecture remains unknown. Using gel-shift DNA binding assays and DNA footprinting with various nuclease probes, we show here that both of the Rif1BS strands adopt specific higher-order structures upon heat denaturation. We observed that the structure generated on the G-strand is consistent with a G4 having unusually long loop segments, and that the structure on the complementary C-strand does not have an intercalated motif (i-motif). Instead, we found that the formation of the C-strand structure depends on the G4 formation on the G-strand. Thus, the higher-order structure generated at Rif1BS involved both DNA strands, and in some cases, G4s may form on both of these strands. The presence of multiple G-tracts permitted the formation of alternative structures when some G-tracts were mutated or disrupted by deazaguanine replacement, indicating the robust nature of DNA higher-order structures generated at Rif1BS. Our results provide general insights into DNA structures generated at G4-forming sequences on duplex DNA.'

30217818	2018	"""The RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is the major scaffold protein for assembly of neuronal gene silencing complexes that suppress gene transcription through regulating the surrounding chromatin structure. REST represses neuronal gene expression in stem cells and non-neuronal cells, but it is minimally expressed in neuronal cells to ensure proper neuronal development. Dysregulation of REST function has been implicated in several cancers and neurological diseases. Modulating REST gene silencing is challenging since cellular and developmental differences can affect its activity. We therefore considered the possibility of modulating REST activity through its regulatory proteins. The human small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 (SCP1) regulates the phosphorylation state of REST at sites that function as REST degradation checkpoints. Using kinetic analysis and direct visualization with X-ray crystallography, we show that SCP1 dephosphorylates two degron phosphosites of REST with a clear preference for phosphoserine 861 (pS861). Furthermore, we show that SCP1 stabilizes REST protein levels which sustains REST's gene silencing function in HEK293 cells. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that REST is a bona fide substrate for SCP1  and that SCP1 phosphatase activity protects REST against degradation. These observations indicate that targeting REST via its regulatory protein SCP1 can modulate its activity and alter signaling in this essential developmental pathway."""

Here, we investigated\xa0 effects of IGF-1, EGF or NGF on the Bmal-1 promoter in two hypothalamic cell lines. We found that only IGF-1 but not EGF or NGF enhanced activity of the Bmal-1 promoter. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 activity did not affect IGF-1-induced Bmal-1 promoter activation and all three growth factors similarly phosphorylated ERK-1/2, questioning a role for ERK-1/2 in controlling BMAL-1 promoter activity. Of note, only IGF-1 induced sustained phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Moreover, the GSK-3β inhibitor lithium or siRNA-mediated GSK-3β knock-down diminished the effects of IGF-1 on the Bmal-1 promoter. When IGF-1 was used in the context of temperature cycles entraining hypothalamic clock gene expression to a 24 h rhythm, it shifted the phase of Bmal-1 promoter activity, indicating that IGF-1 functions as a zeitgeber for cellular hypothalamic circadian clocks. Our results reveal that IGF-1 regulates clock gene expression and that GSK-3β but not ERK-1/2 is required for the IGF-1-mediated regulation of the Bmal-1 promoter in hypothalamic cells.'
30217815	2018	'Human cytochrome P450 enzymes are membrane-bound heme-containing monooxygenases. As is the case for many heme-containing enzymes, substitution of the metal in the center of the heme can be useful for mechanistic and structural studies of P450 enzymes. For many heme proteins the iron protoporphyrin prosthetic group can be extracted and replaced with protoporphyrin containing another metal, but human membrane P450 enzymes are not stable enough for this approach. The method reported herein was developed to endogenously produce human membrane P450 proteins with a non-native metal in the heme. This approach involved coexpression of the P450 of interest, a heme uptake system, and a chaperone in  growing in iron-depleted minimal medium supplemented with the desired trans-metallated protoporphyrin. Using the steroidogenic P450 enzymes CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 and the drug-metabolizing CYP3A4, we demonstrate that this approach can be used with several human P450 enzymes and several different metals, resulting in fully folded proteins appropriate for mechanistic, functional, and structural studies including solution NMR.'
30217814	2018	"""In higher plants, a P-type proton pumping ATPase generates the proton-motive force essential for the function of all other transporters and for proper growth and development.\xa0 X-ray crystallographic studies of the plant plasma membrane proton pump have provided information on amino acids involved in ATP catalysis but provided no information on the structure of the C-terminal regulatory domain. Despite progress in elucidating enzymes involved in the signaling pathways that activate or inhibit this pump, the site of interaction of the C-terminal regulatory domain with the catalytic domains remains a mystery.\xa0 Genetic studies have pointed to amino acids in various parts of the protein that may be involved but direct chemical evidence for which ones are specifically interacting with the C-terminus is lacking. In this study we used  cross-linking experiments with a photo-reactive unnatural amino acid, p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (BPA) and tandem mass spectrometry, to obtain direct evidence that the carboxyl terminal regulatory domain directly interacts with amino acids located within the N-terminal actuator domain. \xa0Our observations are consistent with a mechanism in which intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, interactions are involved. Our model invokes a 'head-to-tail' organization of ATPase monomers in which the carboxyl terminal domain of one ATPase molecule interacts with the actuator domain of another ATPase molecule.\xa0 This model serves to explain why cross-linked peptides are found only in dimers and trimers, and is consistent with prior studies suggesting that within the membrane, the protein can be organized as homopolymers, including dimers, trimers and hexamers."""
30217809	2018	'Newborn neurons in the developing neocortex undergo radial migration, a process that is coupled with their precise passage from multipolar to bipolar shape. The cell-extrinsic signals that govern this transition are, however, poorly understood. Here, we find that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling contributes to the establishment of a bipolar shape in mouse migratory neurons through LPA receptor 4 (LPA4). LPA4 is robustly expressed in migratory neurons. LPA4-depleted neurons show impaired multipolar-to-bipolar transition and become arrested in their migration. Further, LPA4-mediated LPA signaling promotes formation of the pia-directed process in primary neurons overlaid on neocortical slices. In addition, LPA4 depletion is coupled with altered actin organization as well as with destabilization of the F-actin-binding protein filamin A (FlnA). Finally, overexpression of FlnA rescues the morphology and migration defects of LPA4-depleted neurons. Thus, the LPA-LPA4 axis regulates bipolar morphogenesis and radial migration of newborn cortical neurons via remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.'
30217788	2018	'Ichnocarpus frutescens, a climber plant, is distributed all over India. As its different parts are used as anti-inflammatory agent, so we re-investigated the roots to isolate compounds and evaluate its biological efficacy. Also, in-silico molecular docking was carried out to elucidate the structure activity relationship (SAR) of isolated compounds toward identifies the drug target enzyme with validation, which was further supported by anti-inflammatory in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models. The compounds have been undertaken mainly to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy along with molecular docking investigation followed by anti-proteinase, anti-denaturation and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibition studies. Inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 were assayed from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Concavallin (CON A) stimulated human PBMC derived macrophages by Enyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) method. The purity index of the lead compound was determined by HPLC. The compounds were illustrated as 2-hydroxy tricosanoic acid (1), stigmasterol glucoside (2), stigmasterol (3), β-sitosterol (4) and β-sitosterol glucoside (5).The test molecules showed significant anti-denaturation, anti-proteinase and analgesic effect validated with docking study. Compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory and pain killing action due to dexamethasone like phytosterol property. Promising anti-denaturation and anti-proteinase activity offered by the compound 5, may hold its promise to fight against arthritis by rejuvenating the osteoblast cells and destroying the bone-resorpting complex of hydrated protein, bone minerals by secreting the acid and an enzyme collagenase along with pain management. The lead bioactive compound i.e. β-sitosterol glucoside (compound 5) demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory activity showing more than 90% protection against the inflammatory cytokines at 50µM dose. The anti-denaturation and COX-2 inhibition shown by the compound 5 was also noteworthy with the significant IC (ranging from 0.25 to 2.56 µM) that also supporting its future promise for developing as anti-inflammatory agent. Since the most bio-active compound (5) elicit promising acute anti-inflammatory action and peripheral anti-nociceptive pain killing action with a significant ED dose of 3.95 & 2.84 mg/kg i.p. respectively in the in-vivo animal model. It could suggest its potentiality as a good in-vivo bio available agent to be an emerging anti-inflammatory drug regimen scaffold in the future. It also establishes significant in-vitro and in-vivo result co-relation.

STS enzyme activity and the STS:SULT1E1 activity ratio seem to be lower in ECs than in controls. STS is an important route for estrogen supply in endometrial cells.'
30217775	2018	"'Duality of iron as an essential cofactor of many enzymatic metabolic processes and as a catalyst of poorly controlled redox-cycling reactions defines its possible biological beneficial and hazardous role in the body. In this review, we discuss these two ""faces"" of iron in a newly conceptualized program of regulated cell death, ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a genetically programmed iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by enhanced lipid peroxidation and insufficient capacity of thiol-dependent mechanisms (glutathione peroxidase 4, GPX4) to eliminate hydroperoxy-lipids. We present arguments favoring the enzymatic mechanisms of ferroptotically engaged non-heme iron of 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOX) in complexes with phosphatidylethanolamines binding protein 1 (PEBP1) as a catalyst of highly selective and specific oxidation reactions of arachidonoyl- (AA) and adrenoyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). We discuss possible role of iron chaperons as control mechanisms for guided iron delivery directly to their ""protein clients"" thus limiting non-enzymatic redox-cycling reactions. We also consider opportunities of loosely-bound iron to contribute to the production of pro-ferroptotic lipid oxidation products. Finally, we propose a two-stage iron-dependent mechanism for iron in ferroptosis by combining its catalytic role in the 15-LOX-driven production of 15-hydroperoxy-AA-PE (HOO-AA-PE) as well as possible involvement of loosely-bound iron in oxidative cleavage of HOO-AA-PE to oxidatively truncated electrophiles capable of attacking nucleophilic targets in yet to be identified proteins leading to cell demise.'"
30217758	2018	'Histone lysine methylation influences processes such as gene expression and DNA repair. Thirty Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins have been identified and phylogenetically clustered into seven subfamilies. Most JmjC domain-containing proteins have been shown to possess histone demethylase activity toward specific histone methylation marks. One of these subfamilies, the KDM5 family, is characterized by five conserved domains and includes four members. Interestingly, de novo loss-of-function and missense variants in KDM5B were identified in patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but also in unaffected individuals. Here, we report two novel de novo splice variants in the KDM5B gene in three patients with ID and ASD. The c.808\u202f+\u202f1G\u202f>\u202fA variant was identified in a boy with mild ID and autism traits and is associated with a significant reduced KDM5B mRNA expression without alteration of its H3K4me3 pattern. In contrast, the c.576\u202f+\u202f2T\u202f>\u202fC variant was found in twins with global delay in developmental milestones, poor language and ASD. This variant causes the production of an abnormal transcript which may produce an altered protein with the loss of the ARID1B domain with an increase in global gene H3K4me3. Our data reinforces the recent observation that the KDM5B haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism involved in intellectual disability and that KDM5B disorder associated with LOF variants is a recessive disorder. However, some variants may also cause gain of function, and need to be interpreted with caution, and functional studies should be performed to identify the molecular consequences of these different rare variants.'

Among these, PGAP3 mutations are associated with HPMRS type 4. We report two siblings with a novel homozygous variant in PGAP3 expanding both the phenotypic findings and the mutational spectrum of HPMRS type 4. Developmental delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphism were the consistent findings with HPMRS in our patients. Large anterior fontanel size, gum hypertrophy, pes equinovarus, concentric ventricle hypertrophy, frontoparietal atrophy and dysphagia were the findings of our patients that have been reported for the first time in this syndrome. Although there is an extensive list of differential diagnoses in patients with developmental delay and hypotonia, the recognizable pattern of facial features, parental consanguinity and mild to moderate serum ALP elevation should be sufficiently suggestive of HPMRS type 4.'
30217752	2018	"""As two members of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, HAND1 and HAND2 are both required for the embryonic cardiogenesis and postnatal ventricular structural remodeling. Recently a HAND1 mutation has been reported to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the association of a HAND2 mutation with DCM is still to be ascertained. In this research, the coding regions and splicing junction sites of the HAND2 gene were sequenced in 206 unrelated patients affected with idiopathic DCM, and a new heterozygous HAND2 mutation, NM_021973.2: c.199G\xa0>\xa0T; p.(Glu67*), was discovered in an index patient with DCM. The nonsense mutation was absent in 300 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy persons. Genetic scan of the mutation carrier's family members revealed that the genetic mutation co-segregated with DCM, which was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, with complete penetrance. Functional deciphers unveiled that the mutant HAND2 protein had no transcriptional activity. In addition, the mutation abrogated the synergistic transcriptional activation between HAND2 and GATA4 or between HAND2 and NKX2.5, two other cardiac transcription factors that have been implicated in DCM. These research findings firstly suggest HAND2 as a novel gene predisposing to DCM in humans, which adds novel insight to the molecular pathogenesis of DCM, implying potential implications in the design of personized preventive and therapeutic strategies against DCM."""

We performed whole-genome sequence analyses of patients with Hirschsprung disease to identify genetic factors that contribute to disease development and analyzed the functional effects of these variants.\n\nMETHODS: We performed whole-genome sequence analyses of 443 patients with short-segment disease, recruited from hospitals in China and Vietnam, and 493 ethnically matched individuals without Hirschsprung disease (controls). We performed genome-wide association analyses and gene-based rare variant burden tests to identify rare and common disease-associated variants and study their interactions. We obtained induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 4 patients with Hirschsprung disease and 2 controls, and used these to generate enteric neural crest cells for transcriptomic analyses. We assessed the neuronal lineage differentiation capability of iPSC-derived enteric neural crest cells using an in vitro differentiation assay.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 4 susceptibility loci, including 1 in the phospholipase D1 gene (PLD1; P=7.4x10). The patients had a significant excess of rare protein-altering variants in genes previously associated with Hirschsprung disease, and in the beta-secretase 2 gene (BACE2; P=2.9x10). The epistatic effects of common and rare variants across these loci provided a sensitized background that increased risk for the disease. In studies of the iPSCs, we observed common and distinct pathways associated with variants in RET that affect risk. In functional assays, we found variants in BACE2 to protect enteric neurons from apoptosis. We propose that alterations in BACE1 signaling via APP and BACE2 contribute to pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In whole-genome sequence analyses of patients with Hirschsprung disease, we identified rare and common variants associated with disease risk. Using iPSC cells, we discovered some functional effects of these variants.'
30217735	2018	'Sevoflurane is an experimental potent yet volatile anesthesia agent characterized by a low blood/gas partition coefficient. However, exposure to sevoflurane in neonatal mice has been speculated to result in learning deficits and abnormal social behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between sevoflurane and miR-96, in an attempt to identify the means by which it mediates IGF1R to influence the cognitive dysfunction (CD) in neonatal rats. Relationship between differentially expressed miRNAs and sevoflurane concentration was identified. The potential underlying regulatory mechanisms involved with sevoflurane were investigated through the administration of varying concentrations of the agent (1%, 2% and 4%), combined with miR-96 mimic or an inhibitor. A target prediction program was utilized, while the luciferase activity was determined in order to verify whether miR-96 targets IGF1R. The mRNA and protein levels of IGF1R, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were measured followed by the determination of hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Learning and memory performance was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test and step-down test. The obtained results highlighted a positive correlation between miR-96 and the concentration of sevoflurane, while miR-96 was confirmed to negatively target IGF1R. Our analyses indicated that 4% sevoflurane had a significantly stronger effect on reducing the levels of IGF1R and Bcl-2, while elevating the levels of miR-96, Bax and caspase-3 more so than that of 1% or 2% sevoflurane, which resulted in increased hippocampal neuron apoptosis but diminished the learning and memory performance of the rats. The addition of miR-96 mimic was demonstrated to exacerbate the influence of sevoflurane on hippocampal neurons as well as the cognitive function of the rats. The key findings of our study highlighted the role of miR-96 in the potential mechanism of sevoﬂurane anesthesia-induced CD in neonatal rats through the downregulation of IGF1R.'

Structural, motility, electrophysiological, and metabolic analyses revealed that iPSC-CMs co-cultured with MSCs displayed aligned myofibrils with A-, H-, and I-bands that could contract\xa0and relax quickly, indicating the promotion of differentiation and the establishment of the iPSC-CM structural framework, and showed clear gap junctions and an electric pacing of\xa0>2\xa0Hz, indicating enhanced cell-cell interactions. In addition, soluble factors excreted by MSCs, including several cytokines and exosomes, enhanced cardiomyocyte-specific marker production, produced more energy under normal and stressed conditions, and reduced reactive oxygen species production by iPSC-CMs under stressed condition. Notably, gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that microRNAs and proteins in the exosomes impacted the functionality and maturation of iPSC-CMs. Furthermore, cell sheets consisting of a mixture of iPSC-CMs and MSCs showed longer survival and enhanced therapeutic effects compared with those consisting of iPSC-CMs alone. This may lead to a new type of iPSC-based cardiomyogenesis therapy for patients with heart failure.'

One of the major limitation for the use of pentose sugars is that high purity grade D-xylose and D-arabinose are yet to be produced as commodity chemicals. Research and developmental activities are going on in this direction for their use as platform intermediates through economically viable strategies. During chemical pretreatment of biomass, the pentose sugars were generated in the liquid stream along with other compounds. This contains glucose, proteins, phenolic compounds, minerals and acids other than pentose sugars. Arabinose is present in small amounts, which can be used for the economic production of value added compound, xylitol.

30217721	2018	'INTRODUCTION: Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) is approved in the US and EU for the chronic management of patients ≥2\u202fmonths of age with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. GPB is a pre-prodrug, hydrolyzed by lipases to phenylbutyric acid (PBA) that upon absorption is beta-oxidized to the active nitrogen scavenger phenylacetic acid (PAA), which is conjugated to glutamine (PAGN) and excreted as urinary PAGN (UPAGN). Pharmacokinetics (PK) of GPB were examined to see if hydrolysis is impaired in very young patients who may lack lipase activity.\n\nMETHODS: Patients 2\u202fmonths to <2\u202fyears of age with UCDs from two open label studies (n\u202f=\u202f17, median age 10\u202fmonths) predominantly on stable doses of nitrogen scavengers (n\u202f=\u202f14) were switched to GPB. Primary assessments included traditional plasma PK analyses of PBA, PAA, and PAGN, using noncompartmental methods with WinNonlin™. UPAGN was collected periodically throughout the study up to 12\u202fmonths.\n\nRESULTS: PBA, PAA and PAGN rapidly appeared in plasma after GPB dosing, demonstrating evidence of GPB cleavage with subsequent PBA absorption. Median concentrations of PBA, PAA and PAGN did not increase over time and were similar to or lower than the values observed in older UCD patients. The median PAA/PAGN ratio was well below one over time, demonstrating that conjugation of PAA with glutamine to form PAGN did not reach saturation. Covariate analyses indicated that age did not influence the PK parameters, with body surface area (BSA) being the most significant covariate, reinforcing current BSA based dosing recommendations as seen in older patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: These observations demonstrate that UCD patients aged 2\u202fmonths to <2\u202fyears have sufficient lipase activity to adequately convert the pre-prodrug GPB to PBA. PBA is then converted to its active moiety (PAA) providing successful nitrogen scavenging even in very young children.'
30217697	2018	'Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult clinical cases to diagnose with a very low 5-year survival rate of 5%, regardless of the advances made in both the medical and surgical treatment of the disease. One of the contributing factors for the high mortality rate seen of pancreatic cancer patients is the lack of effective chemotherapies, which is believed to be due to drug-resistance. Based on recent evidence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ETM) of pancreatic cancer cells has been found to be associated with the development of drug resistance and an increase in cell invasion. Therefore, we conducted the present study in order to investigate the regulatory effects of Golgi protein-73 (GP73) on PC. GP73 and EMT-related gene expressions in PC, along with the adjacent and chronic pancreatitis tissues were determined by means of RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Cultured PC cells were treated with pAdTrack-CMV, si-NC, GP73 overexpression, Si-GP73, Snail-siRNA and GP73\xa0+\xa0Snail-siRNA. Cell invasion, migration and metastasis were measured in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo. The results revealed that the PC tissues and chronic pancreatitis tissues exhibited diminished E-cadherin expression and amplified GP73, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail expression. In response to GP73 gene silencing, PC cells presented with increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail expression in addition to the inhibition of the number of invasive cells, tumor volume and number of liver lesions. These findings highly indicated that the overexpression of GP73 promotes cell invasion, migration and metastasis by inducing EMT in PC.'

Polyphasic approach and whole genome sequencing were used to determine the taxonomy status and genomic profiles of the novel strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two isolates were closely related to Thermus scotoductus SE-1 (97.1% sequence similarity), and T. amyloliquefaciens YIM 77409 (96.6%). The strains could be differentiated from most recognized Thermus species by their whitish to slight reddish colony color, distinct DNA fingerprinting profiles and low ANI values. Cells stained Gram-negative, rod-shaped of diameter 0.2-0.5μm and length 1.5-5.0μm. Growth occurred at 50-75°C, pH 6.0-9.0 and in the presence of up to 1.0% (w/v) NaCl concentration. Thiosulfate was found to enhance cell growth, besides improving the intensity of its colony color. Oxygen, nitrate, sulfur, and Fe(III) could be used as terminal electron acceptors for growth. MK-8 was the major respiratory menaquinone. Major fatty acids were iso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and anteiso-C. The genome size was 2.26Mbp with 65.5% average GC content. A total of 2374 genes was predicted, comprising 2322 protein-coding and 52 RNA genes.

The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different F concentrations and exposure times to this ion on the pattern of protein expression in the liver of rats. Thirt-six 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups (n\u202f=\u202f18) according to the treatment duration (20 or 60\u202fdays). Each of these groups was then divided into 3 subgroups (n\u202f=\u202f6) according to the concentration of F administered in drinking water, as follows: 0\u202fmg/L (control), 15\u202fmg/L or 50\u202fmg/L. After the experiment periods, the animals were anesthetized and the liver and blood were collected. F was analyzed in plasma and liver. Part of the liver was fixed for histological analysis. Liver proteins were extracted and prepared for quantitative label-free mass spectrometry analysis. F concentrations in plasma and liver were significantly higher in the group treated with 50\u202fmg /L in comparison with control, regardless the time of exposure. Histological alterations in the liver were more evident in the subgroups treated for 20\u202fdays. The proteomic analysis revealed changes in proteins related to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial alteration, apoptosis and cellular respiration upon exposure to F. The results reinforce previous findings showing that the effects of F in the liver are dose- and time-dependent and provide the molecular basis for understanding the evolution of these effects.'

Our aim is to develop a combination therapy that would augment toxicity of etoposide in malignant cells. Based on literature and our experiments, we selected mifepristone (RU486) as a potential supporting molecule that is able to enhance etoposide toxicity against cancer cells. All experiments were performed with Hep G2 cells, a well-known and described human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. By using xCELLigence system, we demonstrated that mifepristone enhances toxicity of etoposide in a dose dependent manner with concomitant caspase-3 activity. We evaluated upregulation of Bax because mifepristone was demonstrated to modulate proapoptotic Bax protein expression. Our data show only weak and not statistically significant increase of Bax expression. On the other hand, we show that mifepristone increases etoposide toxicity via inhibition of ABC transporters, coupled with significant increase of intracellular etoposide concentration. In conclusion, we demonstrate that mifepristone has a synergistic effect with etoposide treatment in the Hep G2 cells and that the effect is related to ABC transporters inhibition.'
30217650	2018	'Global eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will require an efficacious vaccine capable of eliciting protective immunity against genetically diverse HCV strains. Natural spontaneous resolution of HCV infection is associated with production of broadly-neutralizing antibodies targeting the HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2. As such, production of cross-neutralizing antibodies is an important endpoint for experimental vaccine trials. Varying success generating cross-neutralizing antibodies has been achieved with immunogens derived from naturally-occurring HCV strains. In this study the challenge of minimising the genetic diversity between the vaccine strain and circulating HCV isolates was addressed. Two novel synthetic E2 glycoprotein immunogens (NotC1 and NotC2) were derived from consensus nucleotide sequences deduced from samples of circulating genotype 1 HCV strains. These two synthetic sequences differed in their relative positions in the overall genotype 1a/1b phylogeny. Expression of these constructs in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells resulted in high yields of correctly-folded, monomeric E2 protein, which were recognised by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of guinea pigs with either of these consensus immunogens, or a comparable protein representing a circulating genotype 1a strain resulted in high titres of cross-reactive anti-E2 antibodies. All immunogens generated antibodies capable of neutralizing the H77 strain, but NotC1 elicited antibodies that more potently neutralized virus entry. These vaccine-induced antibodies neutralized some viruses representing genotype 1, but not strains representing genotype 2 or genotype 3. Thus, while this approach to vaccine design resulted in correctly folded, immunogenic protein, cross-neutralizing epitopes were not preferentially targeted by the host immune response generated by this immunogen. Greater immunofocussing by vaccines to common epitopes is necessary to successfully elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.'

We assessed whether evidence has shown off-target myocardial dysfunction related to the administration of bortezomib-based chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 70 years who were free of significant cardiovascular disease were included. They underwent evaluations before and after each dose of bortezomib to assess for clinical, subclinical, and transient cardiotoxicity using echocardiography and serum biomarker measurement. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 separately defined intervals. The primary modality for determining subclinical myocardial dysfunction was echocardiographic assessment of the global longitudinal strain (GLS).\n\nRESULTS: Eleven patients (7 men) with an average age of 55 years were included. No evidence of cumulative myocardial dysfunction was found using echocardiographic markers, primarily GLS (average change in absolute GLS,\xa0-1.17; P\xa0= .064). Additionally, no echocardiographic evidence of transient cardiotoxicity was found. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) also did not show any significant changes (ΔLVEF,\xa0-2.17%; P\xa0= .15). Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed no changes in structure or function (ΔLVEF,\xa0-2.6%; P\xa0= .54) and extracellular volume fraction (Δ\xa0= 2%; P\xa0= .46). The serum biomarker levels also did not change significantly over time.\n\nCONCLUSION: We did not observe cardiotoxicity from bortezomib-based chemotherapy despite very intensive evaluation with multiple modalities. Neither cumulative nor transient alterations were found in our metrics, suggesting that bortezomib is safe from a cardiovascular standpoint for patients free of cardiovascular disease.'
30217614	2018	"""Seminal fluid proteins elicit several post-mating physiological changes in mated Drosophila melanogaster females. Some of these changes persist for over a week after mating because the seminal protein that causes these changes, the Sex Peptide (SP), binds to sperm that are stored in the female reproductive tract. SP's sperm binding is mediated by a network of at least eight seminal proteins. We show here that some of these network proteins (CG1656, CG1652, CG9997 and Antares) bind to sperm within 2\u202fh of mating, like SP. However, while SP remains bound to sperm at 4 days post-mating, none of the other network proteins are detectable at this time. We also observed that the same network proteins are detectable at 2\u202fh post-mating in seminal receptacle tissue from which sperm have been removed, but are no longer detectable there by 4 days post-mating, suggesting short-term retention of these proteins in this female sperm storage organ. Our results suggest that these network proteins act transiently to facilitate the conditions for SP's binding to sperm, perhaps by modifying SP or the sperm surface, but are not part of a long-acting complex that stably attaches SP to sperm."""

30217600	2018	'Proteins are essential throughout the biological and biomedical sciences and the purification strategies of proteins of interest have advanced over centuries. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are compound polymers that have recently been highlighted for their sharp and reversible phase transition property when heated above their lower critical solution temperature (LCST). ELPs preserve this behavior when fused to a protein, and as a result providing a simple method to isolate a recombinant ELP fusion protein from cell contaminants by taking the solution through the soluble and insoluble phase of the ELP fusion protein, a technique designated as the inverse transition cycle (ITC). ITC is considered an inexpensive and efficient way of purifying recombinant ELP fusion proteins. In addition, ELPs render recombinant fusion protein more stability and a longer clear time in blood stream, which give ELPs a lot of valuable applications in the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industry. This article reviews the modernizations of ELPs and briefly highlights on the possible use of technologies such as the automatic piston discharge (APD) centrifuges to improve the efficiency of the ITC in the pharmaceutical industry to obtain benefits.'
30217599	2018	'Strategic design and suitable purification techniques are of paramount importance in the production of recombinant proteins, if intended for use in a diagnostic assay. However, there is no single protocol that can be universally adopted for obtaining proteins in requisite quality and quantity across various platforms. In this study, we have targeted proteins of bluetongue virus (BTV), which is the causative agent of an arthropod-borne infectious disease in ruminants. Traditionally, serological diagnosis of the disease has rested upon either virus neutralization test or on an ELISA test that employed a recombinant structural (VP1, VP7) protein. Among the non-structural (NS) proteins of BTV, NS1 and NS3, are preferred candidate antigens in development of immuno-diagnostics as these provide the option for identifying recent/ongoing infection. However, the difficulty in production/purification of recombinant full length NS proteins of BTV in sufficient quantity and quality in various expression systems, due to inherent structural complexities, have restricted their wider applicability as immunodiagnostic reagents. To circumvent the difficulties associated with production/purification, we developed a novel NS1 and NS3 fusion gene (∼1302 bp) encoding for NS1 N-terminus (M to G aa) and NS3 protein containing the N- and C-termini with a deletion of two hydrophobic domains along with intervening variable central domain (A to A aa) of bluetongue virus 23. This construct was cloned, over-expressed and efficiently purified by single step affinity chromatography under unique denaturing/renaturing condition. The purified fusion protein was found suitable for detection of antibodies against BTV in an indirect ELISA (iELISA).'
30217597	2018	'The mechanisms driving innovations that distinguish large taxons are poorly known and essentially accessible via a candidate gene approach. A spectacular acquisition by tunicate larvaceans is the house, a complex extracellular filtration device. Its components are secreted by the oikoplastic epithelium which covers the animal trunk. Here we describe the development of this epithelium in larvae through the formation of specific cellular territories known to produce distinct sets of house proteins (Oikosins). It involves cell divisions and morphological differentiation but very limited cell migration. A diverse set of homeobox genes, most often duplicated in the genome, are transiently and site-specifically expressed in the trunk epithelium at early larval stages. Using RNA interference, we show that two prop duplicates are involved in the differentiation of a region on and around the dorsal midline, regulating morphology and the production of a specific oikosin. Our observations favor a scenario in which multiple homeobox genes and most likely other developmental transcription factors were recruited for this innovation. Their frequent duplications probably predated, but were not required for the emergence of the house.'
30217595	2018	'Hundreds of thousands of cis-regulatory DNA sequences are predicted in vertebrate genomes, but unlike genes themselves, few have been characterized at the functional level or even unambiguously paired with a target gene. Here we serendipitously identified and started investigating the first reported long-range regulatory region for the Nr2f1 (Coup-TFI) transcription factor gene. NR2F1 is temporally and spatially regulated during development and required for patterning and regionalization in the nervous system, including sensory hair cell organization in the auditory epithelium of the cochlea. Analyzing the deaf wanderer (dwnd) spontaneous mouse mutation, we traced back the cause of its associated circling behavior to a 53kb deletion removing five exons and adjacent intronic regions of the poorly characterized Mctp1 gene. Interestingly, loss of Mctp1 function cannot account for the hearing loss, inner ear dysmorphology and sensory hair cell disorganization observed in dwnd mutants. Instead, we found that the Mctp1 deletion affects the Nr2f1 gene located 1.4Mb away, downregulating transcription and protein expression in the embryonic cochlea. Remarkably, the Mctp1 allele failed to complement a targeted inactivation allele of Nr2f1, and transheterozygotes or Mctp1 homozygotes exhibit the same morphological defects observed in inner ears of Nr2f1 mutants without sharing their early life lethality. Defects include improper separation of the utricle and saccule in the vestibule not described previously, which can explain the circling behavior that first brought the spontaneous mutation to attention. By contrast, mice homozygous for a targeted inactivation of Mctp1 have normal hearing and inner ear structures. We conclude that the 53kb Mctp1 deletion encompasses a long-range cis-regulatory region essential for proper Nr2f1 expression in the embryonic inner ear, providing a first opportunity to investigate Nr2f1 function in postnatal inner ears. This work adds to the short list of long-range regulatory regions characterized as essential to drive expression of key developmental control genes.'
30217589	2018	'Bivalve shells are inorganic-organic nanocomposites whose material properties outperform their purely inorganic mineral counterparts. Most typically the inorganic phase is a polymorph of CaCO, while the organic phase contains biopolymers which have been presumed to be chitin and/or proteins. Identifying the biopolymer phase is therefore a crucial step in improving our understanding of design principles relevant to biominerals. In this work we study seven shells; four are examples of nacroprismatic shells (Alathyria jacksoni, Pinctada maxima, Hyriopsis cumingii and Cucumerunio novaehollandiae), one homogeneous (Arctica islandica), and two are crossed lamellar (Callista kingii, Tridacna gigas). Both intact shells, their organic extracts as isolated after decalcification in acid, and the periostracum overlay have been studied by solid-state CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, SEM and chemical analysis. In none of the shells examined in this work do we find a significant contribution to the organic fraction from chitin or its derivatives despite popular models of bivalve biomineralization which assume abundant chitin in the organic fraction of mollusc bivalve shells. In each of the nacroprismatic extracts the C NMR spectra represent similar proteinaceous material, Ala and Gly-rich and primarily organized as β-sheets. A different, yet highly conserved protein was found in the periostracum covering each of the three nacreous shells studied. The Arctica islandica shells with homogeneous microstructure contained proteins which do not appear to be silk-like, while in the crossed lamellar shells we extracted too little organic matter to characterize.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrophobic macromolecules are structural components within the calcareous inorganic matrix of bivalve shells and are responsible for enhanced materials properties of the biominerals. Prevalent models suggest that chitin is such major hydrophobic component. Contrary to that we show that chitin is rare within the hydrophobic biopolymers which primarily consist of proteinaceous matter with structural motifs as silk-like β -sheets, or others yet to be determined. Recognizing that diverse proteinaceous motifs, devoid of abundant chitin, can yield the optimized mechanical properties of bivalve shells is critical both to understand the mechanistic pathways by which they regulate biomineralization and for the design of novel bioinspired materials.'
30217571	2018	'The expression and activity of human placental transporters during pregnancy could be altered by several factors including pathological changes associated with preeclampsia. The aims of this study were to identify the placental efflux transporters involved in the bio-disposition of pravastatin, determine the protein expression of these transporters and their encoding genes as well as the activity of pravastatin uptake in placentas obtained from patients with preeclampsia. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin by trophoblast tissue apical and basal membrane vesicles exhibited sigmoidal kinetics. The curved shapes of Eadie-Hofstee plots indicate that more than one placental transporter are involved in the uptake of pravastatin. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin into vesicles expressing MRP1-5, BCRP, and P-gp, as well as the results of inhibition studies suggest that BCRP and MRP1 are the major placental efflux transporters responsible for the in vitro uptake of pravastatin. Compared to placentas from healthy pregnancies, preeclamptic placentas had increased number of syncytial knots with increased expression of BCRP in their apical membrane and increased expression of MRP1 in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast and in cytoplasm of syncytial knots. There was a concomitant increase in ABCC1 but not in ABCG2 gene expressions in preeclamptic placentas. ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]-pravastatin by vesicles prepared from apical membranes of preeclamptic placentas was similar to the uptake by vesicles prepared from placentas obtained after uncomplicated pregnancies (13.9 ± 6.5 vs 14.1 ± 5.8 pmol·mg protein·min). The transporter-specific changes in the expression of BCRP and MRP1 in preeclamptic placentas did not affect the efflux activity of transporters localized on the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast.'
30217566	2018	'The current therapeutic armamentarium for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) includes second-generation agents such as the Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor enzalutamide and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate, immunotherapies like sipuleucel-T, chemotherapies including docetaxel and cabazitaxel and the radiopharmaceutical radium 223 dichloride. However, relapse of CRPC resistant to these therapeutic modalities occur rapidly. The mechanisms of resistance to these treatments are complex, including specific mutations or alternative splicing of oncogenic proteins. An alternative approach to treating CRPC may be to target the turnover of these molecular drivers of CRPC. In this review, the mechanisms by which protein stability of several oncoproteins such as AR, ERG, GR, CYP17A1 and MYC, will be discussed, as well as how these findings could be translated into novel therapeutic agents.'
30217565	2018	'Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an important transcription factor that is expressed in a variety of tissues and regulates many critical physiologic and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, stem cell reprogramming, maintenance of genomic stability, and normal tissue homeostasis. KLF4 has both tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions in gastrointestinal and other cancers. These functions are thought to be context dependent, but how KLF4 exerts these differential functions and the molecular mechanisms behind them remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the KLF4 gene undergoes alternative splicing, and the protein products of certain transcripts antagonize wild-type KLF4 function, suggesting an additional layer of regulation of KLF4 function. Therefore, detailed study of KLF4 alternative splicing may not only provide new insights into the complexity of KLF4 functions but also lead to rational targeting of KLF4 for cancer prevention and therapy.'
30217564	2018	'The chromosomal locations of lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs, lncRNAs) infer their biological functions in cancer. Lnc-RAB1A-2, a Ras-related protein Rab-1A (RAB1A) upstream lncRNA, was chosen for assessment of its impact on lung cancer prognosis in a case-based analysis and investigation of its biological function though a series of functional assays. Lnc-RAB1A-2 was significantly upregulated in 276 lung cancer tissues compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues, and its expression level was significantly correlated with clinical stage and metastasis status in lung cancer patients. Patients with high expression levels of this lncRNA had a shorter median survival time (16.0 months vs. 23.0 months, P = 011 in southern samples; 8.0 months vs. 19.0 months, P=0.020 in eastern samples; 13.0 months vs. 19.0 months, P=0.002 in merged samples) and a higher risk of death than those with lower levels (HR=1.52; 95% CI=1.01-2.26, in merged samples). Additionally, overexpression of lnc-RAB1A-2 significantly promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses using digital gene expression tag profiling revealed that lnc-RAB1A-2 could affect the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), a gene involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that is largely activated by RAB1A. FGF1 was confirmed to be a down-stream gene of lnc-RAB1A-2. Collectively, our study demonstrated that lnc-RAB1A-2 is associated with poor lung cancer prognosis by promoting lung cancer development.'
30217560	2018	'CD133 is a surface marker of liver cancer stem cells. Transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) promotes sphere growth and circulation. However, it is unknown how CD133 and TM4SF5 cross-talk with each other for cancer stem cell properties. Here, we investigated the significance of inter-relationships between CD133, TM4SF5, CD44, and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) in a three-dimensional (3D) sphere growth system. We found that CD133 upregulated TM4SF5 and CD44, whereas TM4SF5 and CD44 did not affect CD133 expression. Signaling activity following CD133 phosphorylation caused TM4SF5 expression and sphere growth. TM4SF5 bound to CD133 and promoted c-Src activity for CD133 phosphorylation as a positive feedback loop, leading to CD133-mediated sphere growth that was inhibited by TM4SF5 inhibition or suppression. TM4SF5 also bound PTPRF and promoted paxillin phosphorylation. Decreased sphere growth upon CD133 suppression was recovered by TM4SF5 expression and partially by PTPRF suppression. TM4SF5 inhibition enhanced PTPRF levels and abolished PTPRF suppression-mediated sphere growth. Altogether, CD133-induced TM4SF5 expression and function were important for liver cancer sphere growth and may be a promising target to block metastasis.'
30217558	2018	'Maintenance of epigenetic integrity relies on coordinated recycling and partitioning of parental histones and deposition of newly synthesized histones during DNA replication. This process depends upon a poorly characterized network of histone chaperones, remodelers, and binding proteins. Here we implicate the POLE3-POLE4 subcomplex of the leading-strand polymerase, Polε, in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly through its ability to selectively bind to histones H3-H4. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and physical mapping, we define minimal domains necessary for interaction\xa0between POLE3-POLE4 and histones H3-H4. Biochemical analyses establish that POLE3-POLE4 is a histone chaperone that promotes tetrasome formation and DNA supercoiling in\xa0vitro. In cells, POLE3-POLE4 binds both newly synthesized and parental histones, and its depletion hinders helicase unwinding and chromatin PCNA unloading and compromises coordinated parental histone retention and new histone deposition. Collectively, our study reveals that POLE3-POLE4 possesses intrinsic H3-H4 chaperone activity, which facilitates faithful nucleosome dynamics at the replication fork.'
30217538	2018	"'Very little research has assessed how measures of negative and positive affect (NA and PA) derived from assessments at multiple time points per day (e.g., via ecological momentary assessment [EMA]), as opposed to questionnaires that rely on recall over a longer period, are related to levels of peripheral inflammation. We examined how different indicators of NA and PA predicted concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and seven peripheral inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ) that were examined in the form of an inflammatory composite. A community-based sample of 220 adults (62% Black/African-American and 25% Hispanic/Latino; aged 25-65; 65% female) completed questionnaires at baseline (including recalled affect ""over the past month"") and then provided EMA reports 5x/day for 14 days. Blood was drawn from each participant after completion of EMA and used to determine plasma levels of CRP and cytokines. Analyses examined if indicators of affect predicted inflammation, controlling for age, gender, body mass index, education, health conditions, and statin use. Neither recalled NA or PA nor momentary NA or PA (aggregated across the 14 days of EMA) were significantly associated with the cytokine composite or CRP. Negative mood more proximal to the blood draw (i.e., aggregated momentary NA in week 2 of EMA) was associated with the cytokine composite but not CRP. Exploratory moderation analyses revealed that the cytokine composite was also associated with PA in week 2 for men only, and with recalled NA for those with lower education. Exploratory analyses around temporal dynamics suggested that the timing of NA measurement relative to the blood draw mattered: Specifically, there were stronger trends of association between momentary NA and inflammatory cytokines when NA was assessed closer in time to blood collection. Future investigation of the relevance of temporal proximity and other measurement details may improve understanding of how affect relates to inflammation.'"
30217532	2018	'Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5-31 weeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.'
30217522	2018	'Chagas disease is a protozoan parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. This injurious disease spread by the circulation of the blood sucking triatomine insects and transmitted to humans. Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and also known as American trypanosomasis. Currently, 7 million people are infected by T. cruzi infection and about 22,000 death cases were reported per year throughout the Americas. Various immunization approaches against T. cruzi infection have been examined and some of the developed vaccine showed efficacy in animal models but there is no effective and safe vaccines for humans have been developed yet. Since, the drug resistance is increasing day by day because the developed drug (nifurtimox and benznidazole) to control T. cruzi infection, failed to activate a prodrug and still no drug and vaccine have been established. To control the infection of chagas disease, here in this study we use immunoinformatics method to design multi-epitope subunit vaccine against T. cruzi infection. Moreover, on the basis of immunogenicity B and T cell epitopes were evaluated. The allergenicity, antigenicity was predicted to ensure the safety of vaccine constructs whereas, the physiochemical property showing the stable nature of final vaccine model. Further, molecular docking was performed to optimize the interaction between TLR-2 and TLR-4 (receptor) and vaccine model (ligand) complex. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to evaluate the energy minimization; RMSD and RMSF plot which confirm the stability of TLR-2 and TLR-4 (receptor) present on immune cells and vaccine model (ligand) complex. This study needed the experimental validation for the safety and immunogenic behavior of designed vaccine protein and it may be helpful in future to control T. cruzi infection.'
30217517	2018	'Usutu Virus (USUV; flavivirus) is a re-emerging pathogen invading the territories of European countries, Asia, and Africa. It is a mosquito-borne zoonotic virus with a bi-directional transmission route from animal to human and vice versa, and causes neurological disorders such as meningoencephalitis in bats, Homo sapiens, birds and horses. Due to limited availability of information about USUV and its deleterious effects on neural cells causing neurologic impairments, it becomes imperative to study this virus in detail to equip ourselves with a solution beforehand. The current study aims to identify immunodominant peptides that could be exploited in future for designing global peptide vaccine for combating the infections caused by USUV. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was applied to evaluate the immunogenicity of 7 non-structural proteins and determined 64 continuous B-cell epitopes, numerous probable discontinuous B-cell epitopes, 64 MHC Class-I binders, 126 MHC class-II binders and 52 promiscuous binders with a maximum population coverage of 98.55%(MHC Class-I binder ofYP_164815.1 NS4a) and 81.81% (MHC Class-II binders of YP_164812.1 NS2a, YP_164813.1 NS2b, YP_164814.1 NS3, YP_164817.1 NS4b, YP_164818.1 NS5). Further, studies involving experimental validation of these predicted epitopes is warranted to ensure the potential of B-cells and T-cells stimulation for their effective use as vaccine candidates, and as diagnostic agents against USUV.'

Because of nonspecific clinical manifestations, diagnosis of HGA is highly dependent on laboratory tests. Identification of immunoreactive proteins is prerequisite for specific and sensitive immunoassays for HGA. In this study, we identified novel immunoreactive proteins of A. phagocytophilum. Previous studies indicated that secreted proteins of A. phagocytophilum and other bacteria can be immunoreactive antigens. Here we in silico screened A. phagocytophilum genome for encoding proteins which bear features of type IV secretion system substrates. Among seventy seven predicted proteins, fourteen proteins were determined for antigenicity and nine proteins were showed to be immunoreactive antigens. In addition, an APH1384 peptide harboring a B cell epitope predicted by bioinformatics was found specifically reacting with anti-A. phagocytophilum sera. Hereby, we identified novel immunoreactive proteins and delineate a specific epitope of A. phagocytophilum, which might be employed for HGA diagnosis.'
30217511	2018	"""The uncoupling protein (UCP1) is a proton (H) transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane. By dissipating the electrochemical H gradient, UCP1 uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis, which drives an increase in substrate oxidation via the TCA cycle flux that generates more heat. The mitochondrial uncoupling-mediated non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is vital primarily to mammals, such as rodents and new-born humans, but more recently additional functions in adult humans have been described. UCP1 is regulated by β-adrenergic receptors through the sympathetic nervous system and at the molecular activity level by nucleotides and fatty acid to meet thermogenesis needs. The discovery of novel UCP homologs has greatly contributed to the understanding of human diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. In this article, we review the progress made towards the molecular mechanism and function of the UCPs, in particular focusing on the influential contributions from Martin Klingenberg's laboratory. Because all members of the UCP family are potentially promising drug targets, we also present and discuss possible approaches and methods for UCP-related drug discovery."""
30217509	2018	'The immune dysregulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Bcl2 like protein-12 (Bcl2L12) and mast cells are involved in immune dysregulation of UC. This study aims to elucidate the role of Bcl2L12 in the contribution to the pathogenesis of T helper (Th)2-biased inflammation in UC patients. The results showed that Bcl2L12 was expressed by peripheral CD4 T cells that was associated with Th2 polarization in UC patients. Bcl2L12 mediated the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2)-induced IL-4 expression in CD4 cells. Activation of PAR2 increased expression of Bcl2L12 in CD4 T cells. Bcl2L12 mRNA decayed spontaneously in CD4 T cells after separated from UC patients which was prevented by activating PAR2. Bcl2L12 mediated the binding between GATA3 and the Il4 promoter in CD4 T cells. Mice with Bcl2L12 deficiency failed to induce Th2-biased inflammation in the colon mucosa. We conclude that CD4 T cells from UC patients expressed high levels of Bcl2L12; the latter plays an important role in the development of Th2-biased inflammation in the intestine. Bcl2L12 may be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of Th2-biased inflammation.'
30217508	2018	'This study evaluated the synergistic effects of dietary Bacillus subtilis WB60 and mannanoligosaccharide (MOS) in juvenile Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica.

Each diet (BSM (CON), BSM, BSM BSM BSM BSM, and OTC) was fed to triplicate groups of 20 fish averaging 9.00\u202f±\u202f0.11\u202fg (mean\u202f±\u202fSD) for eight weeks. Average weight gain, feed efficiency, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio of fish fed the BSM and BSM diets were significantly higher than those of fish fed CON, BSM and OTC diets (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Significant increases in the nonspecific enzymatic activities (e.g., lysozyme and myeloperoxidase) were detected from fish fed the BSM, BSM, and OTC diets compared to the CON, BSM, and BSM diets (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Whereas, immunoglobulin M expressions were recorded significantly higher for fish fed the BSM and BSM diets compared to those of fish fed the other diets (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Also, heat shock protein 70\u202fmRNA levels of fish fed BSM and BSM diets were significantly higher than those of fish fed the CON diet (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Histological observations of the intestinal morphology showed healthier gut for fish fed BSM and BSM diets than those fed CON, BSM, and OTC diets. Additionally, resistance to bacterial challenge with Vibrio anguillarum was recorded significantly lower for fish fed the CON diet than those fed other diets (P\u202f>\u202f0.05). Therefore, the results for growth performance, non-specific immune responses, intestinal morphology, and disease resistance demonstrated that supplementation of B. subtilis at 0.5\u202f×\u202f10\u202fCFU/g diet and mannanoligosaccharide at 5\u202fg/kg diet could have beneficial synergistic effects in Japanese eel. The isolated probiotic from eel and the selected prebiotic could lead to the development of a specific and potential synbiotic in Japanese eel aquaculture.'
30217507	2018	'Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) infects wild and cultured salmonid fish causing high mortality with serious economic losses to salmonid aquaculture. Ideally, the method of oral immunization should prevent the infection of rainbow trout juveniles with IPNV. In the present study, genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei 393 pPG-612-VP2/L. casei 393 and pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 constitutively expressing VP2 protein of IPNV were constructed. The recombinant strains pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 and pPG-612-VP2/L. casei 393 were orally administrated to juvenile rainbow trouts, and significant titers of IgM and IgT of pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 were observed. The results demonstrate that the recombinants could elicit both local mucosal and systemic immune responses. The proliferation of spleen lymphocytes in trouts immunized with pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 showed that the recombinant strain could induce a strong cellular immune response. The IL-1β, IL-8, CK6, MHC-II, Mx, β-defensin, and TNF-1α levels in the spleen and gut suggest that the target molecular chemokine has the ability to attract relevant immune cells to participate in the inflammatory response and enhance the function of the innate immune response. Additionally, the pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 induced the expression of cytokines, which have the effect of promoting inflammation to drive the differentiation of macrophages and clear target cells. After challenging with IPNV, the reduction in viral load caused by pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 was significantly higher than that of the other groups. Thus, the recombinant pPG-612-CK6-VP2/L. casei 393 is a promising candidate for the development of an oral vaccine against IPNV.'
30217502	2018	'The cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a peptide commonly studied in the feeding behavior, but it exerts an important role in the autonomic and cardiovascular control as well. It is known that exogenous administration of CART in the central nervous system can elicit increase in blood pressure of both conscious and anesthetized rodents, but little is known whether these central effects might differ between lean and obese animals. We have recently shown that diet-induced obese mice that developed hypertension presented an upregulation of CART levels in the dorsomedial nucleus of hypothalamus, while obese normotensive ones had not. Herein we investigate whether the central action of CART could activate differently the hypothalamic nuclei of diet-induced obese mice compared to the lean counterparts by using Fos protein expression,. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to two cohorts, one fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks (obese), and the other fed with regular rodent chow (lean). Both groups received an ICV injection of CART at the dose of 400µM, 1\u2009mM or vehicle. Subsequently, the brains were processed for Fos protein immunohistochemical in order to identify hypothalamic neuronal activation. Significantly greater numbers of Fos-positive neurons were observed in the PVN and DMH of obese mice that received CART 1\u2009mM, when compared to the lean control. These results indicate that the central action of CART induces neuronal activation in the hypothalamic nuclei of obese and lean mice, and this could be relevant to the different autonomic and cardiovascular adjustments that an organism exposed to different diet and metabolic condition.'

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The current studies were aimed at investigating the anti-angiogenic effects of the natural compound 4'-hydroxywogonin (4'-HW) on CRC-related angiogenesis. Human CRC cell line SW620\u202fcells and normal human intestinal epithelial HIEC cells were cultured and treated with interleukin-6 to mimic the tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Our data showed that 4'-HW reduced the viability of SW620\u202fcells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 4'-HW also suppressed the proliferation of SW620\u202fcells, but had little effect on the viability of HIEC cells. Moreover, 4'-HW concentration-dependently decreased the mRNA and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the predominant pro-angiogenic cytokine in tumor angiogenesis. Subsequently, 4'-HW concentration-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT. PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, similar to 4'-HW, significantly downregulated the VEGF-A expression in SW620\u202fcells, and combination of wortmannin and 4'-HW produced more significant effects. Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with the conditioned medium of 4'-HW-treated SW620\u202fcells exhibited impaired angiogenic capacity at Matrigel. Incubation with the neutralizing antibody against VEGF-Aalone also suppressed the angiogenic properties of HUVECs in vitro. Collectively, 4'-HW decreased the viability and reduced angiogenesis in CRC, which was associated with downregulation of VEGF-A expression by disrupting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our discoveries suggested 4'-HW as a promising anticancer agent against CRC targeting angiogenesis."""
30217466	2018	"""INTRODUCTION: On stimulation by lipoteichoic acid or by a physical injury, fibroblasts have been shown to play a major role in the initiation of the pulp inflammatory reaction and healing through secretion of complement proteins and growth factors. The application of direct pulp-capping materials on these cells may interfere with the inflammatory and the healing processes within the pulp's inextensible environment. This work was designed to study in\xa0vitro the effects of silicate-based materials on pulp fibroblast modulation of the initial steps of pulp inflammation and healing.\n\nMETHODS: The effects of Biodentine, TheraCal, and Xeno III eluates were studied on lipoteichoic acid-stimulated and physically injured fibroblasts. Cytokine secretion (interleukin 6, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and transforming growth factor-β1) was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inflammatory THP-1 adhesion to endothelial cells and their migration and activation were studied in\xa0vitro. Human pulp fibroblast proliferation was investigated with the MTT test, and their migration to the injury site was studied with the scratch healing assay.\n\nRESULTS: Interleukin 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion increased with all materials but to a lesser extent with Biodentine. Fibroblast growth factor-2 and transforming growth factor-β1 secretion was significantly higher with Biodentine than with all other materials. THP-1 cell adhesion to endothelial cells and their activation were reduced by Biodentine and TheraCal. However, their migration decreased only with Biodentine. Fibroblast proliferation significantly increased with Biodentine but significantly decreased with Xeno III after day 6. Finally, only Biodentine induced fibroblast migration to the injury site in the scratch assay.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that pulp-capping materials affect the early steps of pulp inflammation and healing. They show that Biodentine had the highest pulp healing and anti-inflammatory potential when compared with the resin-containing materials. This highlights the interest of the material choice for direct pulp-capping."""
30217465	2018	"""Amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ) could induce cognitive deficits through oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuron death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MAPK pathways have been thought to mediate Aβ-induced neuroinflammation responses, neuron death and cognitive decline in AD. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) exerts a neuroprotective effect. However, whether α7nAChR alleviates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through MAPKs (p38, ERK, JNK) in vivo remains unclear. In our study, memory was assessed in C57BL/6 mice using a Y-maze test. Cell death was assessed by Nissl and Hoechst staining and Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, and Cytochrome C levels using Western blotting. Oxidative stress was assayed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Inflammation was examined with GFAP and Iba1 using immunohistochemistry. The Aβ degrading enzymes insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP) were tested using Western blotting. We found that activating α7nAChR or inhibiting p38 or JNK pathway alleviated Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and neuron loss and death by reducing oxidative stress. In addition, activating α7nAChR or inhibiting p38 or JNK pathway also reduced inflammation, which was observed as reduced GFAP and Iba1 levels with different effects on Aβ degrading enzymes. Finally, we found that the activation of α7nAChR led to the downregulation of pp38 and pJNK levels. Conversely, the inhibition of p38 or JNK resulted in the upregulation of α7nAChR levels in the hippocampus and cortex. Our data indicate that the activation of α7nAChR alleviates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, and this protective effect might act through the downregulation of p38 and JNK MAPKs."""
30217463	2018	'A previously disclosed protein kinase (PK) CK2-selective inhibitor 4-(2-amino-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (ATB) and its selenium-containing counterpart (ASB) revealed remarkable room temperature phosphorescence when bound to the ATP pocket of the protein kinase CK2. Conjugation of these fragments with a mimic of CK2 substrate peptide resulted in bisubstrate inhibitors with increased affinity towards the kinase. Attachment of the fluorescent acceptor dye 5-TAMRA to the conjugates led to significant enhancement of intensity of long-lifetime (microsecond-scale) photoluminescence of both sulfur- and selenium-containing compounds. The developed photoluminescent probes make possible selective determination of the concentration of CK2 in cell lysates and characterization of CK2 inhibitors by means of time-gated measurement of photoluminescence.'
30217462	2018	'OBJECTIVE: We investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying action mechanism of INDUS810 isolated from Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (Fabaceae), an annual herb commonly known as fenugreek and reported to have hypocholesterolemic, antidiabetic, anticancer and gastroprotective properties.\n\nMETHODS: For obese animal study, 4-week old mice were fed with normal diet or high-fat diet together with or without intraperitoneal injection of INDUS810 (200mg/kg) twice per week for 15weeks. 3T3-L1 cells were used to study action mechanism of INDUS810 in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism.\n\nRESULTS: We found that INDUS810 can reduce high-fat diet-induced weight increase in epididymal white adipose tissue, interscapular brown adipose tissue and liver, as well as serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, the insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in INDUS810-treated obese mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that INDUS810 could inhibit lipid accumulation at either differentiating or mature stages, and increase lipolysis activity in mature adipocytes. Additionally, INDUS810 has no effects on cell viability nor the expressions of adipocyte differentiation markers like fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α. In contrast, INDUS810 can increase protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1β, sirtuin 1 and sirtuin 3. Of note, INDUS810 can activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, which leads to the reduction of lipid contents in adipocytes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that INDUS810 is a potential anti-obesity agent, and this action depends on activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation.'
30217457	2018	'Icaritin is a compound extracted from herb, recent study have found it is able to influence the activity of various types of cancer. Our aim was to investigate the effects of Icaritin on the physiological activities of esophageal cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, esophageal cancer cells were cultured and CD133 positive esophageal CSCs were sorted by flow cytometry. Changes in the physiological activity of esophageal CSCs following treatment with different concentrations of Icaritin (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100\u202fμmol/L) were evaluated. The CCK-8 method and Transwell assay were used to determine the effects of Icaritin on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of esophageal CSCs. Flow cytometery was used to investigate its effect on the apoptosis of CSCs. The effect of Icaritin on the expression of proteins in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways were determined using western blot test. Consequently, Icaritin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of esophageal CSCs in a dose-dependent manner. It promoted cell apoptosis, and influenced the levels of proteins in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways. It may act as a promising drug in the therapy of esophageal cancer.'
30217455	2018	'Breast cancer is reported a very complex disease along with heterogeneous morphological characteristics and unrelated clinical behavior, and is a leading cancer among female. Nevertheless, chemo-resistance is frequently observed. Adriamycin (ADM) is a always employed drug to treat clinical breast cancer. However, strong resistance to ADM limited its clinical efficacy. Deregulation of HDAC6 activity is linked to various diseases including cancer resulting in accumulating interest for developing HDAC6 inhibitors. In the present study, for the first time, we found that 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), as histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor, could successfully reverse ADM resistance in human breast cancer cells. 4-HBA significantly promoted the anticancer effect of ADM on apoptosis induction, as evidenced by the increased expressions of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, which was associated with the promotion p53 and homeodomain interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) expressions in ADM-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of ADM on drug-resistant breast cancer cells was accelerated by 4-HBA through increasing the number of cells distributed in G2/M phase of cell cycle arrest. Inhibiting HIPK2/p53 pathway could abolish 4-HBA/ADM co-treatment-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Importantly, HDAC6 expressions were also significantly down-regulated in ADM-resistance breast cancer cells co-treated with ADM and 4-HBA. Additionally, 4-HBA clearly potentiated the anticancer role of ADM in the MCF-7 breast cancer animal model with low toxicity. Therefore, 4-HBA could be applied as an effective HDAC6 inhibitor to reverse human breast cancer resistance. Herein, the 4-HBA and ADM combination might represent as a useful therapeutic strategy to prevent human breast cancer.'
30217454	2018	"""The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of pigmented cells adjacent to the choroid coat, the vascular layer of the eye. Among other functions, these cells are responsible for the phagocytosis of rod and cone cell waste shed from the photoreceptor outer segments. We describe here studies to understand the involvement of the motor protein myosin VI in the trafficking of internalized microspheres by a human retinal pigment epithelium primary cell line (ARPE-19). We perturbed the myosin VI-actin interaction by overexpressing a dominant negative myosin VI construct in these cells. We used single particle tracking to characterize the trajectories of internalized fluorescent microspheres. Analysis of the speed of the microspheres' motions revealed that the magnitude of the average speed over short time scales is reduced in the presence of the dominant negative motor. Analysis of the mean-squared displacement of these trajectories demonstrated that trafficking of phagosomes involves two modes of motion, a rapid, more randomly directed motion that is myosin VI dependent and a slower, more directed motion that is independent of the motor. From these data, we posit that this trafficking process involves an interplay between myosin VI motors, which are involved in motion through the actin periphery of the cell, and microtubule motors."""
30217453	2018	'Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, also resulting in long-term serious neurological impairment in survivors. However, the pathogenesis of TBI has not been fully understood. Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, containing a basic region-leucine zipper motif. JDP2 plays essential roles in various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, senescence and aging. In the study, we attempted to explore the effects of JDP2 on TBI progression both in\xa0vivo and in\xa0vitro. The wild type (WT) and JDP2 knockout (KO) mice were employed in our study and were subjected to TBI. The results showed that JDP2-deficient mice exhibited improved cognitive functions in TBI mice. The inflammatory cytokines, glial amount and apoptosis, as well as the protein of cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly increased after TBI in WT mice, and all these up-regulation were significantly mitigated by JDP2 knockout in mice. We also found that TBI induced JDP2 expression in hippocampus of mice. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated JDP2 expression levels in astrocytes isolated from WT mice, indicating the critical role of JDP2 in TBI. Suppressing Caspase-3 activation could reduce LPS-induced inflammation in astrocytes. Consistent with the results in\xa0vivo, LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis were reversed by JDP2 deficiency in cells. Notably, we found that over-expressing JDP2 could further promoted inflammation, apoptosis and Caspase-3 activation induced by LPS. Collectively, JDP2 knockout effectively attenuate TBI in\xa0vivo and in\xa0vitro through blocking Caspase-3 activation, providing a potential therapeutic target for TBI or even other neurological disorders.'
30217449	2018	'Liver cancer has been considered as one of the major leading causes of cancer-related mortality. The incidence of liver cancer tends to increase in less developed regions. Increasing evidences have demonstrated that mircoRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the modulation of tumor growth and progression. Whereas, the functional role of miR-539 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well established. In our present study, we sought to explore biological role of miR-539 in HCC progression. qRT-PCR was utilized to evaluate the expression level of miR-539. Immunoblotting analysis, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assays were used for the identification of the potential target of miR-539. Proliferation, migration and invasion assays and flow cytometric were performed to assess the biological functional role of miR-539. The molecular signaling pathways related to the integration of miR-539 were also evaluated. MiR-539 was reduced in human HCC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, also known as MAP2K1 was verified as the target of miR-539. Overexpression of miR-539 inhibited migration, invasion and cell proliferation, while apoptosis rate was increased. Knockdown or overexpression of MAP2K1 in HCC cell transfected with ag-miR-539 or in-miR-539 indicated that miR-539 suppresses the progression of HCC by directly targeting and regulating MAP2K1. Our results reveal that miR-539 might be a tumor suppressor in HCC, supporting a potential target for advanced therapeutic strategy for this disease.'
30217447	2018	'Many cancer types carry mutations in protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and such alterations frequently drive tumor progression. One category is gene translocation of PTKs yielding chimeric proteins with transforming capacity. In this study, we characterized the role of ITK-FER [Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell Kinase (ITK) gene fused with Feline Encephalitis Virus-Related kinase (FER) gene] and ITK-SYK [Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell Kinase (ITK) gene fused with the Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK)] in Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) signaling. We observed an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation events in the presence of both ITK-FER and ITK-SYK. The downstream targets of ITK-FER and ITK-SYK were explored and STAT3 was found to be highly phosphorylated by these fusion kinases. In addition, the CD69 T-cell activation marker was significantly elevated. Apart from tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting directly on the fusions, we believe that drugs acting on downstream targets could serve as alternative cancer therapies for fusion PTKs.'
30217446	2018	'Macrophage activation plays a critical role in the innate immune response. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) metabolizes l-ornithine to polyamines and is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the metabolism of polyamines, which are reportedly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. However, the function of ODC1 in immune cells and especially in macrophages, as well as its underlying molecular mechanism, remains unclear. This study revealed the potential ODC1 function and mechanism associated with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-, or carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced inflammatory response in macrophages. We found significant upregulation of ODC1 in macrophages following LPS simulation and ODC1-specific suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion from macrophages upon stimulation with LPS, BCG and CCl, respectively, suggesting a role as a common control element of the inflammatory response. Western blotting for nuclear factor-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases revealed significant inhibition of phosphorylation of multiple transcription factors following ODC1 overexpression in macrophages. Moreover, ODC1 inhibited reactive oxygen species-induced and caspase-dependent apoptosis highlighted by decreased caspase-3 and -9 expression following ODC1 upregulation. These findings indicated that ODC1 was involved in attenuating the inflammatory response upon stimulation of macrophages, making it a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.'
30217444	2018	'Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays essential roles in drinking-associated diseases or effects. As we have previously reported, ALDH2 mediates acute ethanol-induced eNOS activation in\xa0vitro. However, whether chronic ethanol treatment has a dose-response endothelial protection, as well as the possible mediating role of ALDH2 involved, is unclear. Here, we show that appropriate dose of ethanol preserved the expression and activity of ALDH2 and eNOS, and alleviated senescence-associated phenotypes in human aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, ALDH2 deficiency impairs the dose-response protection of ethanol against endothelial senescence by promoting the accumulation of 4-HNE, the formation of 4-HNE-SIRT1 protein adducts and the subsequent decrease in SIRT1-dependent p53 deacetylation. Collectively, our data indicate that ALDH2 mediates the protection of appropriate ethanol by modulating SIRT1/p53-dependent endothelial senescence.'
30217442	2018	'The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular process that is characterized by activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2α kinases and subsequent induction of activating transcription factor (ATF)4. The ISR plays an important role in protecting cells from tumor-related metabolic stresses, such as nutrient deprivation and perturbed proteostasis. Here, we showed that disruption of the ISR, together with increased cellular stress vulnerability, was produced by pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL, the oncogenic driver in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Treatment of CML-derived K562\u202fcells with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib, prevented activation of eIF2α kinases, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and general control nonderepressible 2, and downstream ATF4 induction during metabolic stress. Prevention of ATF4 induction likely occurred as a result of the combinatorial suppression of the eIF2α kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PERK mimicked BCR-ABL inhibition to enhance apoptosis induction under stress conditions. These findings indicate that the ISR is under the control of BCR-ABL and may foster adaptation to tumorigenic stresses in CML cells.'

30217408	2018	"""The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a network of neurons and glia found in the gut wall and governs this gastrointestinal function independently from the central nervous system (CNS). ENS comprises the myenteric plexus (MP) and the submucous plexus (SP). In this study, we examined the expression profile of neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), calcyclin (S100A6), vimentin and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal enteric neurons and enteric glia cells (EGCs) during prenatal development using an immunohistochemical method. The material of the study consisted of 15 different fetal ileum tissues obtained between days 60 and 150 of pregnancy. NF-H was observed in the majority of ganglion cells in SP and MP throughout the fetal period. It was determined that there was no NF-H reaction in some ganglion cells in Peyer's patches of internal submucosal plexus (ISPF). In the early stage of pregnancy (60-90 days), there was no expression of NSE and S1006 in ileum. After this period, NSE and S1006 were expressed in the ganglion cells of the plexus, indicating an increase in the amount of expression towards the end of pregnancy. In the early period, vimentin expression was only detected in intramuscular interstitial cells (ICs) (60-90 days), but later (90-150 days) it was also seen in the cells around the ganglion cells in the plexus. On days 60-90 of gestation, GFAP expression only occurred in MP, but in later stages, staining was also detected in SP. In the plexus, an immunoreactivity was present in EGCs forming a network around the ganglion cell. During the last period of gestation (120-150 days), the number of GFAP-positive plexus increased, with the majority of these stained cells being observed in MP. Interestingly, weak staining or reaction did not occur in ISPF, unlike other plexuses. In conclusion, this is the first study that demonstrated the expression of NF-H, vimentin, S100A6, NSE and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal ENS in the prenatal period. In the last period of gestation (120-150 days), the expression profile of ENS was similar to that of adult animals. The expression of the used markers increased toward the end of pregnancy. Our results suggest that neurons and EGCs show heterogeneity, and GFAP and NF-H cannot be used as panenteric glial or panneuronal markers, respectively. We also demonstrated, for the first time, the prenatal expression of S100A6 in enteric neurons and the possibility of using this protein for the identification of enteric neurons."""
30217406	2018	'Inflammation contributes to neonatal brain injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokines represent key inflammatory meditators in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. The high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein is a nuclear protein with pro-inflammatory cytokine properties when it is translocated from the nucleus and released extracellularly after stroke in adult rodents. We have previously shown that HMGB1 is translocated from the nucleus to cytosolic compartment after ischemic brain injury in fetal sheep. In the current study, we utilized the Rice-Vannucci model to investigate the time course of HMGB1 translocation and release after HI injury in neonatal rats. HMGB1 was located in cellular nuclei of brains from sham control rats. Nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 was detected in the ipsilateral-HI hemisphere as early as zero h after HI, and released extracellularly as early as 6\u202fh after HI. Immunohistochemical double staining detected HMGB1 translocation mainly in neurons along with release from apoptotic cells after HI. Serum HMGB1 increased at 3\u202fh and decreased by 24\u202fh after HI. In addition, rat brains exposed to hypoxic injury alone also exhibited time dependent HMGB1 translocation at 3, 12 and 48\u202fh after hypoxia. Consequently, HMGB1 responds similarly after HI injury in the brains of neonatal and adult subjects. We conclude that HMGB1 is sensitive early indicator of neonatal HI and hypoxic brain injury.'
30217381	2018	'Kinases in signaling pathways are commonly activated by multisite phosphorylation. For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk is activated by its kinase Mek by two consecutive phosphorylations within its activation loop. In this article, we use kinetic models to study how the activation of Erk is coupled to its abundance. Intuitively, Erk activity should rise with increasing amounts of Erk protein. However, a mathematical model shows that the signaling off state is robust to increasing amounts of Erk, and Erk activity may even decline with increasing amounts of Erk. This counterintuitive, bell-shaped response of Erk activity to increasing amounts of Erk arises from the competition of the unmodified and single phosphorylated form of Erk for access to its kinase Mek. This shows that phosphorylation cycles can contain an intrinsic robustness mechanism that protects signaling from aberrant activation e.g., by gene expression noise or kinase overexpression after gene duplication events in diseases like cancer.'
30217370	2018	'Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variability in red cell size, predicts adverse outcomes in acquired causes of heart failure. We examined the relation of RDW and outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. We performed a prospective cohort study on 696 ambulatory patients ≥18 years old enrolled in the Boston Adult Congenital Heart Disease Biobank between 2012 and 2016 (mean age 38.7 ± 13.5 years; 49.9% women). The combined outcome was all-cause mortality or nonelective cardiovascular hospitalization. Most patients had moderately or severely complex congenital heart disease (42.5% and 38.5%, respectively). Mean RDW was 14.0 ± 1.3%. RDW >15% was present in 81 patients (11.6%). After median 767 days of follow-up, 115 patients sustained the primary combined outcome, including 31 who died. Higher RDW predicted both the combined outcome (hazard ratio [HR] for RDW >15%\u202f=\u202f4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0 to 6.6; HR per\u202f+\u202f1SD RDW\u202f=\u202f1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0, both p <0.0001) and death alone (HR for RDW >15%\u202f=\u202f7.1, 95% CI 3.5 to 14.4; HR per\u202f+\u202f1SD RDW\u202f=\u202f1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0, both p <0.0001). RDW remained an independent predictor of the combined outcome after adjusting for age, cyanosis, congenital heart disease complexity, ventricular systolic function, New York Heart Association functional class, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR per\u202f+\u202f1SD RDW\u202f=\u202f1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9, p <0.0001). RDW also remained an independent predictor of mortality alone after adjustment for age plus each variable individually. In conclusion, elevated RDW is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or nonelective cardiovascular hospitalization in adults with congenital heart disease. This simple clinical biomarker identifies increased risk for adverse events even among patients with preserved functional status.'

30217293	2018	"'INTRODUCTION: Incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) increased significantly over the last decades. Lack of response to chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of this disease. This study aims to assess the biological relevance of characteristic microRNA profiles of chemotherapy resistant EAC cells with regards to response to chemotherapy and biological behavior.\n\nMETHODS: We selected 3 microRNAs from characteristic microRNA profiles of resistant EAC (miR-27b-3p, miR-200b-3p, and miR-148a-3p). Expression of microRNAs was modified in 6 EAC cell lines. Effects on chemotherapy, adhesion, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle were assessed using standard assays. Target analyses were performed using Western Blot and Luciferase techniques.\n\nRESULTS: MiR-27b-3p significantly sensitized cells to 5FU and Cisplatin in 83% respectively in 33% of cell lines, miR-148a-3p in 67% respectively 33% of cases. MiR-200b-3p increased sensitivity only towards 5FU in 50% of cases. Co-transfections with miR-27b-3p/miR-148a-3p showed an additive effect on response to chemotherapy in 50% of cases. Upregulation of miR-148a-3p reduced protein expression levels of DNMT-1, MSK-1, Bcl-2 and Bim, and miR-27b upregulation led to downregulation of Sp1 and PPARy proteins implicating a potential negative post-transcriptional control via the respective microRNAs. Finally, we were able to confirm Bcl-2 for the first time as direct target of miR-148a-3p in EAC.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that specific microRNA profiles of chemotherapy resistant EAC in fact determine their response to chemotherapy and biological behavior. Our data further show that microRNA-mediated regulation of chemotherapy resistance is complex, and several microRNAs seem to ""co-operate"" at various steps within a broad number of pathways what fits very well to our recently proposed understanding of microRNA-mediated regulation as function of cellular functional complexes. These data highlight the promising potential of microRNAs to predict or monitor treatment response to chemotherapy in EAC, and to potentially modulate tumor biology in a therapeutic approach.'"
30217276		'Staphylococcus aureus infection is a major burden for individuals with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and a known inducer of disease exacerbation. This increased susceptibility to staphylococcal infections has been attributed to abnormalities in the innate immune system of atopic dermatitis (AD) skin, including deficits in barrier proteins and lipids, and a muted response in generating antimicrobial peptides, all of which is further impaired by the activation of Th2 and Th22 immune pathways, which characterizes AD. Skewing of the immune response with a reduced Th1:Th2 ratio and increased adherence of bacteria to AD skin are also thought to contribute. Bacterial species diversity is reduced with flares, concomitant with increases in S. aureus and sometimes clinical infection, which has recently been linked to the finding that commensal bacteria produce anti-S. aureus factors that contribute to the endogenous response. S. aureus produces several virulence factors affecting the skin barrier and immune system, including promoting Th2 cell activation. Best practices for the management of staphylococcal infections include systemic antibiotics, initiation of antiseptics (particularly dilute bleach baths), and sometimes periodic intranasal mupirocin. Newer evidence suggests the possibility that treatment of the skin with commensal bacterial species could also reduce S. aureus growth and increase diversity.'

Following sacrificed, levels of V-ATPase and CA proteins and mRNAs in the vagina were identified by Western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively. Protein distribution was visualized by immunohistochemistry.\n\nRESULTS: Administration of MPE causes the pH of vaginal fluid to decrease and expression and distribution of vaginal V-ATPase A & B and CA II, III, IX, XII and XIII to increase.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The decrease in vaginal fluid pH following MPE treatment suggested that this herb has potential to be used to ameliorate vaginal fluid pH changes in sex-steroid deficient condition.'
30217263	2018	'BACKGROUND: Rhein (4, 5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid), a natural anthraquinone derivative, is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used as a medication in many Asian countries. It has been used as a laxative and stomach drug for a long time in both China and Korea. It is well-known to have many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrosis, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective properties. However, little is known about how rhein may affect the differentiation activities in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells.\n\nPURPOSE: The present study was designed to examine the anti-leukemic effects of rhein against APL cells and to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Cell viability was investigated by MTS assay. To examine the differentiation activities in APL cells, the cell surface molecules (CD11b, CD14, CCR1 and CCR2), phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Also, induction of caspase-3 activity and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry. RNA and protein expressions were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: In this study we assessed the role of rhein in treating APL. Interestingly, rhein potentiated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced macrophage differentiation in NB4 cells by inducing changes in morphology, expression of the differentiation markers CD11b and CD14, ROS production, phagocytic activity, and expression of CCR1 and CCR2. Signaling through CD11b was found to be dependent on ERK activation. Additionally, rhein induced APL cell death by activating apoptosis and suppressing the mTOR pathway.\n\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, we suggest that a combination of rhein and ATRA carries strong therapeutic potential through the beneficial differentiation of APL cells. Moreover, rhein causes cell death via the activation of apoptosis and suppression of survival signals in APL cells. In combination with the ability of rhein to promote functional macrophage differentiation in APL, these properties suggest that a combined treatment of rhein and ATRA has great potential as an anti-leukemic therapy for APL.'
30217262	2018	'BACKGROUND: Obese subjects have been considered to be in a state of chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation. Excess fat accumulation and persistent inflammation may promote renal dysfunction, to cause chronic kidney disease (CKD) and even end-stage kidney failure. Coptidis Rhizoma is a classical traditional Chinese herb well known for its hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. The mechanism is partially associated with its anti-inflammatory effect. However, this effect is rarely investigated in obesity and obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG).\n\nPURPOSE: The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of Coptidis Rhizoma on ORG. It also aimed to determine whether this renal protection effect of Coptidis Rhizoma was related to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome in ORG.\n\nMETHODS: Coptidis Rhizoma concentrated granules were prepared and the main components were identified by 3D-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (3D-HPLC) assay. The animal model of early stage ORG was established in obesity-prone (OP) rats by high protein and high fat diet feeding for 12 weeks. The treatment with Coptidis Rhizoma at different dosages was administered by intragastric infusion simultaneously. Then body weight, kidney weight, plasma lipid profiles, 24\u202fh urine protein/albumin content and kidney histology were measured. Inflammatory biomarkers were examined both in the rat plasma and renal cortex. The gene expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and NF-κB in renal tissues were also measured.\n\nRESULTS: Coptidis Rhizoma alleviated dyslipidemia and reduced the renal weight of the rats with ORG. Meanwhile, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and creatinine clearance rate were significantly improved. Coptidis Rhizoma also attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial hyperplasia, and effacement of podocyte foot in renal tissues of ORG rats. In addition, Coptidis Rhizoma intervention decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18) both in plasma and renal tissue. The gene expression of NLRP3 inflammasome was down-regulated and NF-κB activity was also inhibited by Coptidis Rhizoma in renal tissues of ORG rats.\n\nCONCLUSION: Coptidis Rhizoma can ameliorate early renal damage in ORG rats and the mechanisms appear to be related to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome complex.'
30217257	2018	'BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the most prominent complication attributing to poor pregnancy and neonatal outcome. Infection is most commonly implicated in preterm birth; it initiates a cascade of inflammatory events that leads to the rupture of fetal membranes and spontaneous uterine contractions. Anti-inflammatory agents may thus be a therapeutic approach to prevent the premature rupture of fetal membranes and block contractions. In non-gestational tissues, the polyphenol honokiol has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of honokiol on pro-inflammatory mediators in human gestational tissues.\n\nMETHODS: Fetal membranes, myometrium and freshly isolated amnion cells and primary myometrial cells were treated with honokiol in the absence or presence of the products lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (fsl-1), the viral dsRNA analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF or IL1B. A luciferase assay was used to determine the effect of honokiol on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) RelA transcriptional activity.\n\nRESULTS: Honokiol significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL1A, IL6) and chemokine (CXCL8, CXCL1, CCL2) mRNA expression and secretion from fetal membranes (amnion and choriodecidua) and myometrium stimulated with LPS, fsl-1 or poly(I:C). In amnion cells, honokiol also significantly decreased the expression and secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP9. Moreover, in myometrium, honokiol significantly suppressed the expression of the contraction associated protein PTGFR, the secretion of the uterotonic prostaglandins PGE and PGF and blocked TNF-induced myometrial cell contractility. Finally, honokiol significantly suppressed IL1B- and TNF-induced NF-κB RelA transcriptional activity in primary amnion and myometrial cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Honokiol reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators in human amnion, choriodecidua and myometrium and that this may be facilitated through the suppression of NF-κB activation. These results indicate that the polyphenol honokiol may be a potent therapeutic for the prevention of preterm birth.'
30217256	2018	'BACKGROUND: Nicotine is an important factor in the pathogenesis of renal injury in smokers.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the renoprotective effect of Spirulina platensis extract (SP) against chronic nicotine administration in rats.\n\nMETHODS: Nicotine intoxication was induced with 0.5\xa0mg/kg BW. Rats received 500\xa0mg SP/kg BW by gastric gavage over 4 weeks.\n\nRESULTS: Our data revealed that nicotine induced renal dysfunction manifested by significant abnormal levels of kidney function markers (creatinine and urea) accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress biomarker (malondialdehyde) and inflammatory markers (nitric oxide, Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) while antioxidant status as glutathione level and glutathione S-transferase activity were found to be decreased significantly as compared with controls. It is worthy to note that nicotine toxicity induced significant increments in the protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B as well as caspase-3. Histopathological observations showed tubular necrosis and congestion in the endothelial lining glomerular tuft and epithelial lining renal tubules with nicotine intoxication. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that SP supplementation significantly improved the nicotine-induced kidney dysfunction, alleviated the induced-lipid peroxidation, inflammatory, apoptotic protein markers, and boosted the enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants. Moreover, it attenuated the nicotine-induced histopathological alterations of the kidney architecture.\n\nCONCLUSION: Thus, it is tempting to recommend dietary approaches with Spirulina platensis extract for smokers to minimize the deleterious effect of chronic nicotine consumption and smoke exposure-related problems towards kidney injury via the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of Spirulina platensis.'

Taraxacum formosanum is a medicinal Chinese herb that has been clinically used in Taiwan. However, the investigations of the effects of whole plant on lung cancer are limited.\n\nPURPOSE: This study evaluated the in vitro antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antimigration effects of the ethanol extract of T. formosanum (ETF). The possible molecular mechanism underlying its antitumor effects on cultured human NSCLC cell lines was also elucidated.\n\nMETHODS: The antioxidant effects of the ETF were determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays, and its antiproliferative and antimigration effects were determined using trypan blue exclusion and wound healing assays, respectively. In addition, changes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were investigated using Western blot analyses. Various inhibitors were used to determine the roles of the MAPK signaling pathway involved in the molecular mechanism of the ETF.\n\nRESULTS: Our results showed that the ETF exhibited strong reducing power, a high Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value, and potent 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and Fe-chelating abilities. The ETF also exerted antiproliferative and antimigration effects on NSCLC cells in a dose-dependent manner. These effects may be mediated by the inhibitory effects of the ETF on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study performed the first pharmacological exploration of T. formosanum. Our results demonstrated the antioxidant and antitumor effects of the ETF on NSCLC cell lines, indicating their potential preventive and therapeutic values for lung cancer.'
30217232	2018	"""BACKGROUND: To be eligible to receive treatment with an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF), non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) patients require either elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (CRP\u2009>\u2009upper limit of normal (ULN)) or magnetic resonance imaging assessment showing inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, in addition to meeting criteria for high disease activity. Many axSpA patients are classified as 'CRP-negative', or CRP normal, despite having levels close to the ULN, and are therefore formally ineligible for treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the likelihood of a CRP test indicating elevated levels in axSpA patients that have previously tested CRP normal.\n\nMETHODS: RAPID-axSpA (NCT01087762) enrolled patients who were either magnetic resonance imaging positive or had elevated CRP (>\u2009ULN: 7.9\xa0mg/L). CRP data from the double-blind period for placebo-randomised patients until re-randomisation to certolizumab pegol (week 16 for ASAS20 non-responders/week 24 for ASAS20 responders) were analysed. CRP was assessed at screening, baseline, and nine time points to week 24. Linear mixed models were used to investigate time trends, variability, and correlations of CRP data.\n\nRESULTS: Of 106 placebo-randomised patients with baseline CRP assessments, 26 (25%) tested CRP normal at baseline, of whom 13 (50%) had ≥\u20091 test indicating elevated CRP to week 16. Of 80/106 (75%) patients with elevated baseline CRP, 25 (31%) had ≥\u20091 normal CRP test to week 16. Linear mixed models did not reveal changes in mean CRP across placebo patients from baseline to week 24.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In axSpA patients with CRP\u2009<\u2009ULN the CRP test should be repeated after ≥\u20094\xa0weeks as there is a substantial chance of finding a positive result for elevated CRP at subsequent testing, thereby allowing the patient access to treatment.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01087762 .

30217224	2018	'BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence recognizes that DNA methylation abnormalities play critical roles in cancer development. Our previous genome-wide methylation profile showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8 like 3 (TIPE3) was hypermethylated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the relationship between TIPE3 methylation and its mRNA expression, as well as its biological roles in NPC are unknown.\n\nMETHODS: Bisulfite pyrosequencing and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to quantify the TIPE3 methylation and expression levels. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate the correlation between TIPE3 methylation levels and survival in two patient cohorts collected from two hospitals (n\u2009=\u2009441). The MTT, colony formation, Transwell migration and invasion assays, and xenograft tumor growth and lung metastatic colonization models were used to identify the functions of TIPE3 on NPC cells.\n\nRESULTS: We found that TIPE3 CpG island (CGI) was hypermethylated and its mRNA levels were downregulated in many cancers, including NPC. TIPE3 downregulation was associated with its CGI hypermethylation. Furthermore, NPC patients with high TIPE3 CGI methylation levels had poorer clinical outcomes than those with low methylation levels. The TIPE3 CGI methylation level was an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, restoring TIPE3 expression significantly inhibited NPC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and lung metastatic colonization in vivo, while silencing TIPE3 acted in an opposite way.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TIPE3 downregulation correlates with its CGI hypermethylation in several solid cancers. TIPE3 acts as a tumor suppressor in NPC, providing a further insight into NPC progression and representing a potential prognostic biomarker for NPC.'

Therefore PTEN might be a biomarker for various diseases, and targeting the abnormal expression level of PTEN is anticipated to offer novel therapeutic avenues. Recently, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been reported to regulate protein expression, and it is definite that PTEN expression is controlled by ncRNAs epigenetically or posttranscriptionally as well.

30217218	2018	"""BACKGROUND: Recently, many potential prognostic biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC) have been identified, but the prognosis of advanced GC patients remains poor. Chloride channels are promising cancer biomarkers, and their family member chloride channel-3 (CLC-3) is involved in multiple biological behaviors. However, whether CLC-3 is a prognostic biomarker for GC patients is rarely reported. The molecular mechanisms by which CLC-3 is regulated in GC are unclear.\n\nMETHODS: The expression of CLC-3 and XRCC5 in human specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The primary biological functions and pathways related to CLC-3 were enriched by RNA sequencing. A 5'-biotin-labeled DNA probe with a promoter region between -\u2009248 and +\u2009226 was synthesized to pull down CLC-3 promoter-binding proteins. Functional studies were detected by MTS, clone formation, wound scratch, transwell, and xenograft mice model. Mechanistic studies were investigated by streptavidin-agarose-mediated DNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, ChIP, dual-luciferase reporter assay system, Co-IP, and immunofluorescence.\n\nRESULTS: The results showed that CLC-3 was overexpressed in human GC tissues and that overexpression of CLC-3 was a poor prognostic biomarker for GC patients (P\u2009=\u20090.012). Furthermore, higher expression of CLC-3 was correlated with deeper tumor invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and increased lymph node metastasis (P\u2009=\u20090.016), and knockdown of CLC-3 inhibited cell proliferation and migration in vitro. In addition, X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5) was identified as a CLC-3 promoter-binding protein, and both CLC-3 (HR 1.671; 95% CI 1.012-2.758; P\u2009=\u20090.045) and XRCC5 (HR 1.795; 95% CI 1.076-2.994; P\u2009=\u20090.025) were prognostic factors of overall survival in GC patients. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that the expression and function of CLC-3 were inhibited after XRCC5 knockdown, and the inhibition effects were rescued by CLC-3 overexpression. Meanwhile, the expression and function of CLC-3 were promoted after XRCC5 overexpression, and the promotion effects were reversed by the CLC-3 knockdown. The mechanistic study revealed that knockdown of XRCC5 suppressed the binding of XRCC5 to the CLC-3 promoter and subsequent promoter activity, thus regulating CLC-3 expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with PARP1.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that overexpression of CLC-3 is regulated by XRCC5 and is a poor prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer. Double targeting CLC-3 and XRCC5 may provide the promising therapeutic potential for GC treatment."""

30217208	2018	"""BACKGROUND: Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito borne tropical viral disease affecting hundreds of millions of people across the globe annually. The dengue virus (DENV) includes four genetically distinct serotypes that cause serious life-threatening infections, including dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Dengue vaccine development is complicated by the possibility of vaccine-enhanced severe dengue disease due to antibody-dependent enhancement by pre-existing cross-reactivity, as well as homotypic antibodies. Thus, the development of an efficacious dengue vaccine conferring simultaneous and durable immunity to each of the four DENV serotypes has not yet been developed despite years of research. For mass immunization in deeply affected resource-limited countries, oral vaccination is considered more beneficial than conventional approaches. Therefore, in a continuing effort towards designing economical and potent vaccine candidates, the current study applied yeast surface display technology to develop an oral dengue vaccine candidate using whole recombinant yeast cells displaying the recombinant fusion protein of M cell targeting ligand Co1 fused to the synthetic consensus dengue envelope domain III (scEDIII). Female Balb/c mice were orally fed with recombinant yeast cells and immunogenicity in terms of systemic and mucosal immune responses was monitored.\n\nRESULTS: Immunofluorescence microscopy with dengue specific antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody clearly showed that recombinant protein Co1-scEDIII-AGA was localized on the cell surface of the respective clones in comparison with scEDIII-Co1 and Mock cells with no fluorescence. Oral dosage applications of surface displayed Co1-scEDIII-AGA stimulated a systemic humoral immune response in the form of dengue-specific serum IgG, as well as a mucosal immune response in the form of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Antigen-specific B cell responses in isolated lymphoid cells from the spleen and Peyer's patches further supported an elevated mucosal immune response. In addition, surface displayed Co1-scEDIII-AGA feeding elicited strong immune responses in comparison with scEDIII-Co1 and Mock following intraperitoneal booster with purified scEDIII antigen.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Surface displayed preparations of Co1-scEDIII-AGA induced strong immunogenicity compared with non-displayed scEDIII-Co1. Prior studies have supported the neutralization potential of scEDIII constructs against all four serotypes. Thus, the oral administration of genetically engineered yeast whole cells displaying biologically active Co1-scEDIII fusion protein without any further processing shows prospective as a potent oral vaccine candidate against dengue viral infection."""

However, which genes influence the productivity of desired proteins in K. marxianus has so far been investigated by very few studies.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we constructed a K. marxianus recombinant (FIM1/Est1E), which expressed the heterologous ruminal feruloyl esterase Est1E as reporter. UV-Co-γ irradiation mutagenesis was performed on this recombinant, and one mutant (be termed as T1) was screened and reported, in which the productivity of heterologous Est1E was increased by at least tenfold compared to the parental FIM1/Est1E recombinant. Transcriptional perturbance was profiled and presented that the intracellular vesicle trafficking was enhanced while autophagy be weakened in the T1 mutant. Moreover, whole-genome sequencing combined with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene-editing identified a novel functional protein Mtc6p, which was prematurely terminated at Tyr251 by deletion of a single cytosine at 755 loci of its ORF in the T1 mutant. We found that deleting C755 of MTC6 in FIM1 led to 4.86-fold increase in the production of Est1E compared to FIM1, while the autophagy level decreased by 47%; on the contrary, when reinstating C755 of MTC6 in the T1 mutant, the production of Est1E decreased by 66% compared to T1, while the autophagy level increased by 124%. Additionally, in the recombinant with attenuated autophagy (i.e., FIM1 mtc6 and T1) or interdicted autophagy (i.e., FIM1 atg1Δ and T1 atg1Δ), the productivity of three other heterologous proteins was also increased, specifically the heterologous mannase Man330, the β-1,4-endoxylanase XynCDBFV or the conventional EGFP.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Mtc6p was involved in regulating autophagy; attenuating or interdicting autophagy would dramatically improve the yields of desired proteins in K. marxianus, and this modulation could be achieved by focusing on the premature mutation of Mtc6p target.'
30217192	2018	'BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 60%~\u200970% oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer (BC) cases and promotes the growth of this cancer subtype. Expression of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a transcription factor, is highly restricted to epithelial cells in hormone-regulated tissues. MYC and its negative regulator MAD1 play an important role in BC progression. Previously, we found that PDEF expression is strongly correlated with AR expression. However, the relationship between AR and PDEF and the function of PDEF in ER-negative BC proliferation are unclear.\n\nMETHODS: AR and PDEF expression in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines was determined by performing immunohistochemistry or western blotting. Protein expression levels and location were analysed by performing western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to validate the regulation of AR-PDEF-MAD1-MYC axis. Moreover, the effect of AR and PDEF on BC progression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nRESULTS: We found that PDEF was overexpressed in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines and appeared to function as an oncogene. PDEF expression levels were strongly correlated with AR expression in ER-negative BC, and PDEF transcription was positively regulated by AR. PDEF upregulated MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative BC. Finally, we found that compared with the inhibition of AR expression alone, simultaneous inhibition of AR and PDEF expression further suppressed tumour proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the role of the AR-PDEF-MAD1-MYC axis in BC progression and suggest that PDEF can be used as a new clinical therapeutic target for treating ER-negative BC.'

Additionally, we performed matrigel invasion assay and cytotoxicity assay using cells overexpressing the nectin-4.\n\nRESULTS: NECTIN4 transcripts were elevated in pre-eclamptic placentas relative to uncomplicated pregnancies. Nectin-4 protein levels in pre-eclamptic placentas were higher on a semi-quantitative western blot. Nectin-4 was localized at the apical cell membrane in syncytiotrophoblast cells and not at the adherens junctions. Nectin-4 was also detected in cytotrophoblasts and a subset of cells in the decidua. Nectin-4 overexpressing trophoblast cells migrated normally in the matrix. However, Natural killer (NK) cells showed a strong cytotoxic effect against nectin-4 overexpressing trophoblast cells. No causative genetic variation was evident in the NECTIN4 gene from a pre-eclamptic placenta.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There are as yet unknown factors that induce nectin-4 overexpression in trophoblast cells that may contribute to abnormal placentation via an aberrant immune response and the onset of a pre-eclamptic pregnancy.'

Mutational analysis of the L2HGDH gene was performed on the L-2-HGA patient and his parents, which revealed two novel mutations in exon 3: a homozygous missense mutation (c.407 A\u2009>\u2009G, p.K136R) in both the maternal and paternal allele, and a heterozygous frameshift mutation [c.407 A\u2009>\u2009G, c.408 del G], (p.K136SfsX3) in the paternal allele. The mutation site p.K136R of the protein was located in the pocket of the FAD/NAD(P)-binding domain and predicted to be pathogenic.\n\nCONCLUSION: We predicted the homozygous missense mutation (c.407 A\u2009>\u2009G, p.K136R) was considered as the pathogenic mutation of the patient. The study highlights the power of pedigree analysis in order to interpret novel mutations.'
30217147	2018	"""BACKGROUND: Our previous study found that more than 500 transcripts significantly increased in abundance in the zebrafish and mouse several hours to days postmortem relative to live controls. The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions. We rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3- to 9- mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome and that these features putatively serve as binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively, which represents less than 1.5% of all possible features. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3' untranslated regions of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the open reading frames of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the open reading frames of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked 3' or 5' untranslated regions. These results suggest the transcripts with high density of features might serve as 'molecular sponges' that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, and thus indirectly increase the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some of the features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress, such as organismal death, have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome. Some of these features serve as putative binding sites for proteins and non-coding RNAs that determine transcript stability and fate. A small number of the transcripts have high density sequence features, which are presumably involved in sequestering RNA binding proteins and microRNAs and thus preventing regulatory interactions among other transcripts. Our results provide baseline data on post-transcriptional regulation in stressful conditions that has implications for regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer."""
30217143	2018	'BACKGROUND: Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily are proteins that are critical for insects to detect changes in environmental stimuli and also play key roles in their sensory physiology. Moreover, this family provides potential targets for the design of insecticides. In contrast to a large number of studies conducted on Drosophila melanogaster, molecular studies to characterize TRP channels in agricultural pests are lacking.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we identified 15 TRP channel genes in the genome of a notorious agricultural pest, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). Comparative analysis of the TRP channels (TRPs) in B. dorsalis with those in D. melanogaster, Glossina morsitans, Musca domestica and the closely related Ceratitis capitata, and TRPs from mosquitoes, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera reveals that members of TRPA and TRPP subfamily are most diverse among insects. The results also suggest that Tephritidae family have two TRP-Polycystin 2 members even though most insects either possess just one or none. The highest expression levels of these two genes are in the testes of B. dorsalis, implying a role in regulating sperm function. We analyzed the expression profiles of the TRP channels identified in this study at different life stages using quantitative real time PCR. The results of this study demonstrate that all TRP channels are mainly expressed in adults, especially at mature stages. The one exception to this trend is BdTRPM, which is more highly expressed in the eggs of B. dorsalis, implying an important role in early development. We also detected the spatial expression of TRP channels in mature adult fruit flies by investigating expression levels within various tissues including those involved in sensory function, such as antennae, compound eyes, mouthparts, legs, and wings, as well as tissues critical for homeostasis and physiology (i.e., Malpighian tubules, the brain and gut as well as fat bodies, ovaries, and testes).\n\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study establish a solid foundation for future functional characterization of B. dorsalis TRP channels as well as those of other insects and will help future insecticide design targeting these channels.'
30217128	2018	'Protein transfection is a versatile tool to study or manipulate cellular processes and also shows great therapeutic potential. However, the repertoire of cost effective techniques for efficient and minimally cytotoxic delivery remains limited. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are multifunctional nanocarriers for cellular delivery of a wide range of molecules, they are simple and economical to synthesize and have shown great promise for protein delivery. In this work we present a general strategy to optimize the delivery of active protein to the nucleus. We generated a bimolecular Venus based optical sensor that exclusively detects active and bioavailable protein for the performance of multi-parameter optimisation of protein delivery. In conjunction with cell viability tests we maximized MSN protein delivery and biocompatibility and achieved highly efficient protein transfection rates of 80%. Using the sensor to measure live-cell protein delivery kinetics, we observed heterogeneous timings within cell populations which could have a confounding effect on function studies. To address this problem we fused a split or dimerisation dependent protein of interest to chemically induced dimerisation (CID) components, permitting control over its activity following cellular delivery. Using the split Venus protein we directly show that addition of a small molecule dimerizer causes synchronous activation of the delivered protein across the entire cell population. This combination of cellular delivery and triggered activation provides a defined starting point for functional studies and could be applied to other protein transfection methods.'

Risk-benefit was evaluated based on infections and DAS28-CRP improvement >1.2.\n\nRESULTS: The NEG and EG of the safety analysis set comprised 2,170 and 1,712 patients, respectively; corresponding 6-month ABA retention rates were 80.2% and 77.1%. The NEG had fewer adverse drug reactions (14.5% vs. 17.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.021) and infections (4.8% vs. 7.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.002) than the EG. DAS28-CRP changed similarly between groups. The proportion of patients with low-risk/high-benefit and high-risk/low-benefit were 33.1% and 6.9% (NEG) and 29.7% and 9.0% (EG). Low-risk/high-benefit patients were younger, had shorter disease duration and fewer comorbidities, and were with less use of oral glucocorticoid and prior biologics, more use of methotrexate and higher DAS28-CRP than high-risk/low-benefit patients at baseline.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: ABA was well tolerated and similarly efficacious in the EG and NEG. Identification of factors related to low-risk/high-benefit may aid appropriate patient selection.'
30217100	2018	'Autophagy primarily works to counteract nutrient deprivation that is strongly engaged during starvation and hypoxia, which happens in hypoperfusion. Nonetheless, autophagy is slightly active even in baseline conditions, when it is useful to remove aged proteins and organelles. This is critical when the mitochondria and/or proteins are damaged by toxic stimuli. In the present review, we discuss to that extent the recruitment of autophagy is beneficial in counteracting brain hypoperfusion or, vice-versa, its overactivity may per se be detrimental for cell survival. While analyzing these opposite effects, it turns out that the autophagy activity is likely not to be simply good or bad for cell survival, but its role varies depending on the timing and amount of autophagy activation. This calls for the need for an appropriate autophagy tuning to guarantee a beneficial effect on cell survival. Therefore, the present article draws a theoretical pattern of autophagy activation, which is hypothesized to define the appropriate timing and intensity, which should mirrors the duration and severity of brain hypoperfusion. The need for a fine tuning of the autophagy activation may explain why confounding outcomes occur when autophagy is studied using a rather simplistic approach.'
30217095	2018	'Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as the main body storage compartment for vitamin A through retinyl ester (RE)-filled lipid droplets (LDs). Upon liver injury, HSCs adopt a myofibroblastic phenotype characterized by an elevated expression of extracellular matrix proteins and a concomitant loss of LDs. On the one hand, LD breakdown has been suggested to provide the energy required for HSC activation into myofibroblast-like cells. On the other hand, this process could mitigate HSC activation following the transformation of released REs into retinoic acids (RAs), ligands for nuclear receptors exerting antifibrotic transcriptional regulatory activities in HSCs. Importantly, RAs may also constitute a means for HSCs to orchestrate the liver response to injury by triggering transcriptional effects in multiple additional surrounding liver cell populations. We envision that new approaches, such as single-cell technologies, will allow to better define how RAs are issued from LD loss in HSCs exert a multicellular control of the liver (patho)physiology.'
30217073	2018	'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is frequently reported to phosphorylate Ser1177 of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), and therefore, is linked with a relaxing effect. However, previous studies failed to consistently demonstrate a major role for AMPK on eNOS-dependent relaxation. As AMPK also phosphorylates eNOS on the inhibitory Thr495 site, this study aimed to determine the role of AMPKα1 and α2 subunits in the regulation of NO-mediated vascular relaxation. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine and acetylcholine was assessed in aortic and carotid artery segments from mice with global (AMPKα) or endothelial-specific deletion (AMPKα) of the AMPKα subunits. In control and AMPKα1-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells, eNOS phosphorylation on Ser1177 and Thr495 was assessed after AMPK activation with thiopental or ionomycin. Global deletion of the AMPKα1 or α2 subunit in mice did not affect vascular reactivity. The endothelial-specific deletion of the AMPKα1 subunit attenuated phenylephrine-mediated contraction in an eNOS- and endothelium-dependent manner. In in vitro studies, activation of AMPK did not alter the phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1177, but increased its phosphorylation on Thr495. Depletion of AMPKα1 in cultured human endothelial cells decreased Thr495 phosphorylation without affecting Ser1177 phosphorylation. The results of this study indicate that AMPKα1 targets the inhibitory phosphorylation Thr495 site in the calmodulin-binding domain of eNOS to attenuate basal NO production and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction.'
30217069	2018	'BACKGROUND/AIMS: In rodents, carnosine treatment improves diabetic nephropathy, whereas little is known about the role and function of anserine, the methylated form of carnosine.\n\nMETHODS: Antioxidant activity was measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and oxygen stress response in human renal tubular cells (HK-2) by RT-PCR and Western-Immunoblotting. In wildtype (WT) and diabetic mice (db/db), the effect of short-term anserine treatment on blood glucose, proteinuria and vascular permeability was measured.\n\nRESULTS: Anserine has a higher antioxidant capacity compared to carnosine ( < 0.001). In tubular cells (HK-2) stressed with 25 mM glucose or 20⁻100 µM hydrogen peroxide, anserine but not carnosine, increased intracellular heat shock protein (Hsp70) mRNA and protein levels. In HK-2 cells stressed with glucose, co-incubation with anserine also increased hemeoxygenase (HO-1) protein and reduced total protein carbonylation, but had no effect on cellular sirtuin-1 and thioredoxin protein concentrations. Three intravenous anserine injections every 48 h in 12-week-old db/db mice, improved blood glucose by one fifth, vascular permeability by one third, and halved proteinuria (all  < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Anserine is a potent antioxidant and activates the intracellular Hsp70/HO-1 defense system under oxidative and glycative stress. Short-term anserine treatment in diabetic mice improves glucose homeostasis and nephropathy.'
30217061	2018	'Fasting or postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is considered an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. The intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) is involved in the intracellular transport and metabolism of fatty acids. The presence of the  polymorphism of the  gene appears to be involved in postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. We explored the possible association of the Ala54Thr polymorphism with fat intolerance in apparently healthy, fasting, normolipidemic subjects with normal body-mass index and without diabetes.  A total of 158 apparently healthy individuals were classified as fat tolerant ( = 123) or intolerant ( = 35) according to their response (plasma triglycerides) to an oral abbreviated tolerance test with blood samples taken at 0, 2 and 4 h. At 0 h, all subjects ingested 26.3 g of fats. Presence of the Ala54Thr polymorphism of the  gene was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction⁻restriction fragment length (PCR⁻RFLP).  The group with fat intolerance (postprandial hypertriglyceridemia group) showed an increased frequency of the Thr54Thr genotype when compared with the group with normal fat tolerance (control group) (23% vs. 4%, respectively, OR: 16.53, 95% CI: 4.09⁻66.82, : 0.0001, pc: 0.0003). Carriers of at least one Thr54 allele were up to six times more prevalent in the fat intolerant group than in the non-carriers. (OR: 6.35; 95% CI: 1.86⁻21.59, : 0.0003, pc: 0.0009). The levels of plasma triglycerides (Tg) at 4 h after the test meal were higher in carriers of at least one 54Thr allele than in carriers of the Ala54 allele (p < 0.05).  There is a significant association between postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and the presence of at least one 54Thr allele of the  gene. In addition, subjects with this genotype showed an increased ratio of Tg/HDL-cholesterol. This parameter is a marker of increased CVD risk and insulin resistance.'
30217057	2018	'The use of -omics technologies allows for the characterization of snake venom composition at a fast rate and at high levels of detail. In the present study, we investigated the protein content of Red-headed Krait () venom. This analysis revealed a high diversity of snake venom protein families, as evidenced by high-throughput mass spectrometric analysis. We found all six venom protein families previously reported in a transcriptome study of the venom gland of , including phospholipases A₂ (PLA₂s), Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitors (KSPIs), three-finger toxins (3FTxs), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), snaclecs, and natriuretic peptides. A combined approach of automated database searches and de novo sequencing of tandem mass spectra, followed by sequence similarity searches, revealed the presence of 12 additional toxin families. De novo sequencing alone was able to identify 58 additional peptides, and this approach contributed significantly to the comprehensive description of the venom. Abundant protein families comprise 3FTxs (22.3%), KSPIs (19%), acetylcholinesterases (12.6%), PLA₂s (11.9%), venom endothelial growth factors (VEGFs, 8.4%), nucleotidases (4.3%), and C-type lectin-like proteins (snaclecs, 3.3%); an additional 11 toxin families are present at significantly lower concentrations, including complement depleting factors, a family not previously detected in  venoms. The utility of a multifaceted approach toward unraveling the proteome of snake venoms, employed here, allowed detection of even minor venom components. This more in-depth knowledge of the composition of  venom facilitates a better understanding of snake venom molecular evolution, in turn contributing to more effective treatment of krait bites.'

30217051	2018	'A risk of ischemic stroke increases exponentially after menopause. Even a mild-ischemic stroke can result in increased frailty. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes, which subsequently increases risk of cerebrovascular events and severe cognitive decline, particularly after menopause. Several interventions to reduce frailty and subsequent risk of stroke and cognitive decline have been proposed in laboratory animals and patients. One of them is whole body vibration (WBV). WBV improves cerebral function and cognitive ability that deteriorates with increased frailty. The goal of the current study is to test the efficacy of WBV in reducing post-ischemic stroke frailty and brain damage in reproductively senescent female rats. Reproductively senescent Sprague-Dawley female rats were exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and were randomly assigned to either WBV or no-WBV groups. Animals placed in the WBV group underwent 30 days of WBV (40 Hz) treatment performed twice daily for 15 min each session, 5 days each week. The motor functions of animals belonging to both groups were tested intermittently and at the end of the treatment period. Brains were then harvested for inflammatory markers and histopathological analysis. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in inflammatory markers and infarct volume with significant increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and improvement in functional activity after tMCAO in middle-aged female rats that were treated with WBV as compared to the no-WBV group. Our results may facilitate a faster translation of the WBV intervention for improved outcome after stroke, particularly among frail women.'
30217020	2018	'We previously discovered a novel sirtuin (SIRT) inhibitor, MHY2256, that exerts anticancer activity through p53 acetylation in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We investigated the anticancer activity of MHY2256 against hormone-related cancer, an endometrial cancer with a poor prognosis. The IC values of MHY2256 were shown to be much lower than those of salermide, a well-known SIRT inhibitor. Furthermore, MHY2256 significantly reduced the protein expression and activities of SIRT1, 2, and 3, with similar effects to salermide. Particularly, MHY2256 markedly inhibited tumor growth in a tumor xenograft mouse model of Ishikawa cancer cells. During the experimental period, there was no significant change in the body weight of mice treated with MHY2256. A detailed analysis of the sensitization mechanisms of Ishikawa cells revealed that late apoptosis was largely increased by MHY2256. Additionally, MHY2256 increased G1 arrest and reduced the number of cell cyclic-related proteins, suggesting that apoptosis by MHY2256 was achieved by cellular arrest. Particularly, p21 was greatly increased by MHY225656, suggesting that cell cycle arrest by p21 is a major factor in MHY2256 sensitization in Ishikawa cells. We also detected a significant increase in acetylated p53, a target protein of SIRT1, in Ishikawa cells after MHY2256 treatment. In a mouse xenograft model, MHY2256 significantly reduced tumor growth and weight without apparent side effects. These results suggest that MHY2256 exerts its anticancer activity through p53 acetylation in endometrial cancer and can be used for targeting hormone-related cancers.'
30217018	2018	'The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Nef, plays an essential role in disease progression and pathogenesis via hijacking the host cellular membrane-trafficking machinery. Interestingly, HIV-1 group-M subtypes display differences in the rate of disease progression. However, few reports investigated how the cellular behaviors and activities of Nef isolates from reference strains may differ between HIV-1 group-M subtypes. Here, we characterize how differing cellular distributions of Nef proteins across group-M subtypes may impact protein function using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. We demonstrate that Nef variants isolated from HIV-1 group-M subtypes display differences in expression, with low expressing Nef proteins from reference strains of subtypes G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) also displaying decreased functionality. Additionally, we demonstrate variations in the subcellular distribution and localization of these Nef proteins. Nef from subtype G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) reference strains also failed to colocalize with the trans-Golgi network, and were not differentially localized to cellular markers of multivesicular bodies or lysosomes. Strikingly, our results demonstrate that HIV-1 Nef proteins from reference strains G (F1.93.HH8793) and H (BE.93.VI997) highly colocalize with labeled mitochondrial compartments.'
30217017	2018	'The landscape of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) affecting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human cancers remains largely unexplored. While the majority of lncRNAs remain to be functionally characterized, several have been implicated in cancer development and metastasis. Considering the plethora of lncRNAs genes that have been currently reported, it is conceivable that many more lncRNAs might function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. We devised a strategy to detect focal lncRNA SCNAs using a custom DNA microarray platform probing 10,519 lncRNA genes. By screening a panel of 80 cancer cell lines, we detected numerous focal aberrations targeting one or multiple lncRNAs without affecting neighboring protein-coding genes. These focal aberrations are highly suggestive for a tumor suppressive or oncogenic role of the targeted lncRNA gene. Although functional validation remains an essential step in the further characterization of the involved candidate cancer lncRNAs, our results provide a direct way of prioritizing candidate lncRNAs that are involved in cancer pathogenesis.'
30217009	2018	'Ricin A chain (RTA) depurinates the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) by interacting with the C-termini of the ribosomal P stalk. The ribosome interaction site and the active site are located on opposite faces of RTA. The interaction with P proteins allows RTA to depurinate the SRL on the ribosome at physiological pH with an extremely high activity by orienting the active site towards the SRL. Therefore, if an inhibitor disrupts RTA⁻ribosome interaction by binding to the ribosome binding site of RTA, it should inhibit the depurination activity. To test this model, we synthesized peptides mimicking the last 3 to 11 amino acids of P proteins and examined their interaction with wild-type RTA and ribosome binding mutants by Biacore. We measured the inhibitory activity of these peptides on RTA-mediated depurination of yeast and rat liver ribosomes. We found that the peptides interacted with the ribosome binding site of RTA and inhibited depurination activity by disrupting RTA⁻ribosome interactions. The shortest peptide that could interact with RTA and inhibit its activity was four amino acids in length. RTA activity was inhibited by disrupting its interaction with the P stalk without targeting the active site, establishing the ribosome binding site as a new target for inhibitor discovery.'

NSCLC cells treated with CTT reduced cell growth through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway inhibition, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and the activation of apoptosis. CTT induced an increase of caspase-3, caspase-9, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and Bax, as well as inhibition of Bcl-2, survivin, and cellular-inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP-1 and -2).

30217000	2018	'Recently, the benefit of step-wise sequential delivery of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 from a bioinspired apatite drug delivery system on mouse calvarial bone repair was demonstrated. The thicknesses of the nanostructured poly-l-Lysine/poly-l-Glutamic acid polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) and the bone-like apatite barrier layer that make up the delivery system, were varied. The effects of the structural variations of the coating on the kinetics of cell access to a cytotoxic factor delivered by the layered structure were evaluated. FGF-2 was adsorbed into the outer PEM, and cytotoxic antimycin-A (AntiA) was adsorbed to the substrate below the barrier layer to detect the timing of the cell access. While MC3T3-E1 osteoprogenitor cells accessed AntiA after three days, the RAW 264.7 macrophage access occurred within 4 h, unless the PEM layer was removed, in which case the results were reversed. Pits were created in the coating by the RAW 264.7 macrophages and initiated delivery, while the osteoprogenitor cell access to drugs occurred through a solution-mediated coating dissolution, at junctions between the islands of crystals. Macrophage-mediated degradation is therefore a mechanism that controls drug release from coatings containing bioinspired apatite.'

30216987	2018	'The importance of local DNA structures in the regulation of basic cellular processes is an emerging field of research. Amongst local non-B DNA structures, G-quadruplexes are perhaps the most well-characterized to date, and their presence has been demonstrated in many genomes, including that of humans. G-quadruplexes are selectively bound by many regulatory proteins. In this paper, we have analyzed the amino acid composition of all seventy-seven described G-quadruplex binding proteins of Homo sapiens. Our comparison with amino acid frequencies in all human proteins and specific protein subsets (e.g., all nucleic acid binding) revealed unique features of quadruplex binding proteins, with prominent enrichment for glycine (G) and arginine (R). Cluster analysis with bootstrap resampling shows similarities and differences in amino acid composition of particular quadruplex binding proteins. Interestingly, we found that all characterized G-quadruplex binding proteins share a 20 amino acid long motif/domain (RGRGR GRGGG SGGSG GRGRG) which is similar to the previously described RG-rich domain (RRGDG RRRGG GGRGQ GGRGR GGGFKG) of the FRM1 G-quadruplex binding protein. Based on this protein fingerprint, we have predicted a new set of potential G-quadruplex binding proteins sharing this interesting domain rich in glycine and arginine residues.'

30216961	2018	'Nitric oxide (NO) involved in various metabolic processes in plants. Although its significant influence has been established, the exact mechanisms of NO-derived products under metal-stress conditions are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the key components of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) metabolisms under cadmium (Cd) stress using Arabidopsis as the model plant. Exposure to Cd disturbed redox homeostasis and increased lipid peroxidation, thus triggering oxidative stress. Complementarily, Cd caused differential changes in the selected amino acids: a promotion in partial amino acids might be a genotype-specific trait, while the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity increased in a dose-dependent manner in shoots. Furthermore, NO production as well as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) activity were up-regulated by Cd with the simultaneous depletion of GSNO. Correspondingly, S-nitrosothiols were involved in generating peroxynitrite and tyrosine nitration of protein (NO-Tyr), in accordance with the regulation of NO-mediated post-translational modifications in antioxidant systems, including the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, amino acids and phenolic compounds, thereby provoking nitrosative stress. Our data provide comprehensive evidences regarding the clear relationships between the metabolisms of ROS and RNS, supporting the indicator role of NO-Tyr as a nitrosative stress in plants, and help to provide a better understanding of the ROS/RNS interaction under stress conditions.'
30216959	2018	"""Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing nations where high cost and logistical issues severely limit the use of current HIV therapeutics. This, combined HIV's high propensity to develop resistance, means that new anti-viral agents against novel targets are still urgently required. We previously identified novel anti-HIV agents directed against the nuclear import of the HIV Integrase (IN) protein, which plays critical roles in the HIV lifecycle inside the cell nucleus, as well as in transporting the HIV pre-integration complex (PIC) into the nucleus. Here we investigate the structure activity relationship of a series of these compounds for the first time, including a newly identified anti-IN compound, Budesonide, showing that the extent of binding to the IN core domain correlates directly with the ability of the compound to inhibit IN nuclear transport in a permeabilised cell system. Importantly, compounds that inhibited the nuclear transport of IN were found to significantly decrease HIV viral replication, even in a dividing cell system. Significantly, Budesonide or its analogue Flunisolide, were able to effect a significant reduction in the presence of specific nuclear forms of the HIV DNA (2-LTR circles), suggesting that the inhibitors work though blocking IN, and potentially PIC, nuclear import. The work presented here represents a platform for further development of these specific inhibitors of HIV replication with therapeutic and prophylactic potential."""

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is one of the major pathways for protein breakdown in cells and it has been suggested that impaired UPS-mediated removal of protein aggregates could play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. To study the effects of an impaired UPS on Aβ pathology in\xa0vivo, transgenic APP/PS1ΔE9 mice (APPPS1) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing mutant ubiquitin (UBB), a protein-based inhibitor of the UPS. Surprisingly, the APPPS1/UBB crossbreed showed a remarkable decrease in Aβ plaque load during aging. Further analysis showed that UBB expression transiently restored PS1-NTF expression and γ-secretase activity in APPPS1 mice. Concurrently, UBB decreased levels of β-APP-CTF, which is a γ-secretase substrate. Although UBB reduced Aβ pathology in APPPS1 mice, it did not improve the behavioral deficits in these animals."""
30216895	2018	'Sugarcane vinasse is a residue generated at a rate fifteen times greater than the ethanol production. Because of its high organic and micronutrient content, this residue is used as a fertilizer on sugarcane crops. However, when used in large quantities, vinasse can saturate the soil and contaminate nearby water resources by percolation and leaching. Given the proven toxic potential of in natura vinasse, the present study aimed to evaluate the toxic potential of leached sugarcane vinasse using Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a test organism. A bioassay was performed after vinasse percolation in laboratory soil columns. The bioassay included one control group containing fresh water and two treatment groups, the first exposed to a 2,5% dilution of leached of vinasse and the second to a 2,5% dilution of in natura vinasse. After exposure, histopathological analysis was performed in gills and livers, and the latter were labelled for HSP70 proteins. No significant changes were detected in the gills of the exposed fish. However, in the liver, both in natura and leached vinasse induced statistically significant histopathological changes. These changes include hydropic degeneration, cell boundary losses, pyknotic nuclei and cellular disorganization. HSP70 expression significant increase in liver of both treatment groups were observed, being higher for the in natura vinasse exposed group. Results suggested that both leached vinasse and in natura vinasse were toxic, its still able to provoke histological changes and induce the cytoprotective response in exposed fish liver, evidenced by a immunostaining of cellular stress proteins. Thus, in order to reduce its environmental impact, appropriated effluent disposal is essential.'
30216888	2018	'Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has been widely used as a plasticizer in industry. DEHP can cause testicular atrophy, yet the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, male mice were intragastrically (i.g.) administered with 0, 100, 200 or 400\u202fmg DEHP/kg/day for 21 days. We found that DEHP caused disintegration of the germinal epithelium and decreased sperm density in the epididymis. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the levels of cleaved Caspase-8, cleaved Caspase-3 and Bax proteins and a decrease in Bcl2 protein. The results indicated that DEHP could induce apoptosis of the testis tissue. Meanwhile, DEHP significantly induced autophagy in the testis tissues with increases in LC3-II, Atg5 and Beclin-1 proteins. The serum testosterone concentration decreased in the DEHP-treated group, implying that DEHP might lead to Leydig cell damage. Furthermore, oxidative stress was induced by DEHP in the testis. To further investigate the potential mechanism, mouse TM3 Leydig cells were treated with 0-80\u202fμM DEHP for 48\u202fh. DEHP significantly inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis. Oxidative stress was involved in DEHP-induced apoptosis as N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an inhibitor of oxidative stress, could rescue the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis by DEHP. Similar to the in\xa0vivo findings, DEHP could also induce cell autophagy. However, inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased cell viability and inhibited apoptosis. Taken together, oxidative stress was involved in DEHP-induced apoptosis and autophagy of mouse TM3 Leydig cells, and autophagy might play a cytotoxic role in DEHP-induced cell apoptosis.'
30216880	2018	'To assess hepatotoxicity and to determine the underlying mechanisms of carbamazepine (CBZ) toxicity in fish, histopathology and the liver proteome were examined after Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to 1, 10, and 100\u202fμg/L CBZ for 28 days. Histopathological changes included disruption of spatial structure, pyknotic nuclei, cellular vacuolization and deformation of cell nuclei, in addition to marked swelling of hepatocytes in all treatment groups. Protein analysis revealed that there were gender-specific responses in rare minnow following exposure, and there were 47 proteins in females and 22 proteins in males identified as differentially abundant following CBZ treatments. Pathway analysis revealed that cellular processes affected by CBZ included apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and the respiratory chain, indicating impaired energy homeostasis. Noteworthy was that 15 proteins identified as different in abundance were associated with carcinogenicity. Relative mRNA levels for select transcripts were consistent with the changes of proteins N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG), Tropomyosin 2-Beta (TPM2) and annexin A4 (ANXA4). Protein pyruvate kinase, liver and RBC (PKLR) were increased at 1 and 100\u202fμg/L CBZ without significant difference in transcript levels. These findings characterize molecular responses and histological changes in the liver that generate new insights into CBZ hepatotoxicity in Chinese rare minnow.'
30216878	2018	'Microplastics (MPs) have the potential to interact with the toxicity of other common environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals. Here, we investigated the impacts of polystyrene-MPs (32-40\u202fμm), cadmium (Cd) and their combination on early juveniles of the discus fish (Symphysodon aequifasciatus) in relation to Cd accumulation, antioxidant defence and innate immunity. Animals were exposed to three concentrations of MPs (0, 50 or 500\u202fμg\u202fL) crossed with two levels of Cd (0 or 50\u202fμg\u202fL) for 30 days. Our findings showed that MPs and Cd had no adverse effects on growth and survival. Under exposure to Cd, however, accumulation of Cd in the body of fish decreased with increasing MP concentrations as supported by a reduced metallothionein content. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase increased with MPs but decreased with Cd. MPs, Cd or the mixture increased catalase activity, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. Glutathione levels increased when exposed to high MP concentrations but decreased when co-exposed to Cd. Malondialdehyde content was only influenced by MPs and increased with elevated MPs. MPs or Cd alone did not increase protein carboxyl content but showed a synergistic effect and increased content. MPs or Cd alone showed no effect on lysozyme activity but had a synergistic effect and activated activity. Activities of both acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were enhanced by MPs, Cd or their mixture, although there was an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. In contrast, MPs, Cd or their mixture decreased complement 3 content, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. Collectively, this study suggests that exposure to Cd led to reduced Cd accumulation in the presence of MPs. Nevertheless, co-exposure could induce severe oxidative stress and stimulate innate immunity in the juvenile S.\xa0aequifasciatus.'
30216854	2018	'Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is mainly caused by the accumulation of lipofuscin and drusen on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Both oxidative stress and autophagic dysfunction accelerate the deposition of lipofuscin at the RPE. One of the key regulators in the response against oxidative stress is the NF-E2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2)-kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) axis, which is also closely associated with the autophagy pathway. Nrf2 activation upregulates the expression levels of certain anti-oxidative enzymes [e.g. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], which attenuates oxidative damage. However, until now, the relationship between cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation and autophagic degradation remain unclear. To address these questions, we investigated the effects of a novel Nrf2 activator, RS9, on RPE damage. We found that RS9 protected ARPE-19 cells against NaIO-induced oxidative damage, and that the protective effects of RS9 were inhibited by co-treatment with zinc protoporphyrin, an HO-1 inhibitor. Next, we examined the involvement of autophagic degradation in the protective effects of RS9. Co-treatment with RS9 and chloroquine, a lysosomal acidification inhibitor, inhibited the protective effect. Furthermore, western blotting and immunostaining showed that RS9 accelerated autophagy flux and induced transient upregulation of p62 [also known as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)]. Co-treatment with chloroquine and RS9 also inhibited the degradation of autophagosomes. Transient upregulation of SQSTM1 by RS9 was unaltered by HO-1 knockdown using siRNA. RS9 and chloroquine had the same actions in light damaged adult zebrafish retina as those in vitro. In conclusion, we clarified the relationship between acceleration of the autophagy pathway and the cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation in RPE cells and zebrafish retina. These findings indicated that Nrf2 activation could be a promising therapeutic approach for non-exudative AMD by supporting RPE maintenance.'
30216853	2018	'Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration contributes largely to pathoanatomical and degenerative changes of spinal structure that increase the risk of low back pain. Apoptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) can aggravate IVD degeneration, and increasing studies have shown that interventions targeting NP cell apoptosis can ameliorate IVD degeneration, exhibiting their potential for use as therapeutic strategies. Recent data have shown that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in NP tissues in parallel with the progression of IVD degeneration and form a microenvironment of oxidative stress. This study examined whether AGEs accumulation aggravates NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration, and explored the mechanisms underlying these effects. We observed that the viability and proliferation of human NP cells were significantly suppressed by AGEs treatment, mainly due to apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was detected after AGEs treatment. In addition, the molecular data showed that AGEs could significantly aggravate the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and prolonged activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, as well as the increased level of Bax protein and decreased level of Bcl-2 protein in mitochondria. These effects could be reduced by antioxidant (2-(2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl) triphenylphosphonium chloride (MitoTEMPO) and Visomitin (SKQ1). Importantly, we identified that impairment of Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) function and the mitochondrial antioxidant network were vital mechanisms in AGEs-induced oxidative stress and secondary human NP cell apoptosis. Finally, based on findings that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) could restore SIRT3 function and rescue human NP cell apoptosis through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (AMPK-PGC-1α) pathway in vitro, we confirmed its protective effect on AGEs-induced IVD degeneration in vivo. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that SIRT3 protects against AGEs-induced human NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration. Targeting SIRT3 to improve mitochondrial redox homeostasis may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for attenuating AGEs-associated IVD degeneration.'

As a result, MAPK pathway is associated with human cancer initiation, in particular RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma) component. The mutation in RAF component leads to auto-activation of MAPK signaling pathway, stimulating the uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. In last few years, diverse chemical scaffolds have been identified as RAF inhibitors. Most of these scaffolds show potent anti-cancer activity. The present review highlights the recent investigations of RAF inhibitors during the last five years.'
30216846	2018	'BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter (PM) may lead to increased systemic blood pressure, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. Emerging evidence shows that extracellular vesicle-enriched miRNAs (evmiRNAs) are associated with PM exposure and cardiovascular risk. In this study, we investigated the role of evmiRNAs in the association between PM and blood pressure, as well as their epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation.\n\nMETHODS: Participants (n\u202f=\u202f22, men) were randomly selected from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS). Long-term (1-year and 6-month average) PM exposure was estimated at 1\u202f×\u202f1-km resolution using spatio-temporal prediction models and BC was estimated using validated time varying land use regression models. We analyzed 31 evmiRNAs detected in ≥\u202f90% of all individuals and for statistical analysis, we used mixed effects models with random intercept adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, C-reactive protein, platelets, and white blood cells.\n\nRESULTS: We found that per each 2-standard deviations increase in 6-month PM ambient levels, there was an increase in 0.19\u202fmm Hg (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.11, 0.28\u202fmmHg; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Per each 2-standard deviations increase in 1-year PM levels, there was an increase in 0.11\u202fmm Hg (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 0.03, 0.19\u202fmmHg; p\u202f=\u202f0.012) in SBP in older male individuals. We also found that both miR-199a/b (β\u202f=\u202f6.13\u202fmmHg; 95% CI: 0.87, 11.39; p =\u202f0.07) and miR-223-3p (β\u202f=\u202f30.17\u202fmmHg; 95% CI: 11.96, 48.39\u202fmmHg; p =\u202f0.01) modified the association between 1-year PM and SBP. When exploring DNA methylation as a potential mechanism that could epigenetically regulate expression of evmiRNAs, we found that PM ambient levels were negatively associated with DNA methylation levels at CpG (cg23972892) near the enhancer region of miR-199a/b (β\u202f=\u202f-13.11; 95% CI: -17.70, -8.52; p<\u202f0.01), but not miR-223-3p.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that expression of evmiRNAs may be regulated by DNA methylation in response to long-term PM ambient levels and modify the magnitude of association between PM and systolic blood pressure in older individuals.'
30216839	2018	'Bacterial probiotics are of increasing use against intestinal disorders such as food allergy. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying probiotics-mediated anti-allergic effect remains unknown. In the present study, we orally treated OVA-sensitized mice with Bifidobacterium infantis (BB) for two weeks. It was found that OVA specific-IgE and-IgG levels in serum were significantly decreased after BB administration. BB treatment also significantly reduced the release of IL-4, -5, -13 in splenocytes. Besides, after challenge with OVA, the occurrence of temperature drop and diarrhea was dramatically reduced in BB group. Moreover, the protective effect of BB on allergic mice was correlated with its antioxidative enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). The antioxidative effect of BB on Dendritic cells (DCs0 was further demonstrated to be mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling. We also found that the mRNA and protein expression levels of TIM4 were attenuated in BB group. Finally, ChIP-qPCR assay studies indicate that BB reduced the binding of STAT6 to its response elements in the TIM4 promoter. In conclusion, orally administration of BB protected allergic mice via attenuation of oxidative stress, which further reduced TIM4 expression by inhibiting its transcription factor STAT6.'
30216835	2018	'Colloidal molecules created by clustering monodisperse particles are a significant model system of atoms and molecules in colloidal scale. To attain modelling of complex or high-molecular-weight molecules such as hyper-branched polymers and proteins, it is required to develop a new assembling system which can prepare three-dimensionally designed colloidal molecules. In this study, we proposed an approach for complex colloidal molecules created by association between golf ball-like particles and spherical particles via depletion interaction. Several golf ball-like particles joined together, which formed joined particle assemblies at the spherical particles acting as their joints in a depletant solution. The number of golf ball-like particles in a particle assembly was increased by increasing the concentration of the depletant, leading to the formation of branched colloidal chains of the golf ball-like particles. Because the golf ball-like particles in the colloidal chain flexibly rotated at their joints, the conformation of the chains varied in the depletant solution. The present results demonstrated that the golf-ball like particle that can be joined to form colloidal macromolecules with high association number and high flexibility will be a promising building block for complex colloidal model systems.'
30216832	2018	'Protein functionalized micro-scale patterned structures are developed using a biocompatible polymer PLGA (poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide)) via thin film dewetting and by step-wise chemical conjugations with EDA (ethylenediamine) and anti-EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) antibodies to target the epithelial cell adhesion molecules of cancer cells. The effectiveness of such protein functionalized patterned surface is checked through cell isolation process using blood samples spiked with different cancer cells such as MCF-7, A549, MDA-MB-231. An efficient capture yield of 92% is obtained with MCF-7 cells over a two hour incubation time. The study demonstrates the effects of cell concentration and incubation time on the binding of cancer cells to the modified patterned surfaces. For the first time, a simple and inexpensive method is reported to fabricate functionalized PLGA patterned surface for an efficient isolation of cancer cells from diluted blood samples. The method shows the potential to be used as an effective platform for the development of an improved circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation device from the clinical blood sample.'
30216822	2018	'Bleeding heterogeneity observed in haemophilia A (HA) may attribute to that the available monitoring methods cannot appropriately reflect the coagulation profile. The present study aimed to develop a global approach by changing the clotting initiation way in rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) assay. ROTEM was run in Factor VIII (FVIII)-immune-depleted plasma to which different concentrations of recombinant VIII (rFVIII) had been added, and also in 31 patients with HA. The clotting activators were APTT reagent (1.2\u202f×\u202f10 of the dose used in the original APTT method) and recombinant tissue factor (0.02\u202fpmol/L). In FVIII-immune-depleted plasma spiked with rFVIII, maximum velocity of coagulation reliably mirrored the rFVIII levels. This dose-response disappeared after the samples were pre-incubated with an antibody against TFPI, protein S, activated prothrombin complex concentrate or rFVIIa known to favour the extrinsic activation. In the HA patients with FVIII 0-0.21\u202fIU/mL, APTT and ROTEM outcomes varied in significant correlations to FVIII activity; however, this correlation became non-significant when only samples with FVIII 0-0.05\u202fIU/mL were included.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The decreased coagulation in HA mostly result from deficiency/absence of FVIII; other pro-/anti-thrombotic proteins are also influential. The multiple effects may cause a mismatch between bleeding phenotype and FVIII concentrations. The ROTEM assay with the clotting activators i.e., tiny doses of APTT reagent and TF are more effective than the original APTT method as regards the assay sensitivity to influence by VIII activity and also to that by other pro-/anti-thrombotic proteins, showing the whole coagulation picture behind the phenotypic heterogeneity in HA.'
30216817	2018	"""This study examined the temperature susceptibility of a continuous-flow lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) to temperature shifts from 35\u202f°C to 55\u202f°C and its bioconversion robustness treating synthetic phenolic wastewater at 16 gNaL. During the experiment, the mesophilic reactor was subjected to stepwise temperature increases by 5\u202f°C. The phenol conversion rates of the AnMBR decreased from 3.16\u202fat 35\u202f°C to 2.10\u202fmgPhgVSSd at 45\u202f°C, and further decreased to 1.63\u202fmgPhgVSSd at 50\u202f°C. At 55\u202f°C, phenol conversion rate stabilized at 1.53\u202fmgPhgVSSd whereas COD removal efficiency was 38% compared to 95.5% at 45\u202f°C and 99.8% at 35\u202f°C. Interestingly, it was found that the phenol degradation process was less susceptible for the upward temperature shifts than the methanogenic process. The temperature increase implied twenty-one operational taxonomic units from the reactor's microbial community with significant differential abundance between mesophilic and thermophilic operation, and eleven of them are known to be involved in aromatic compounds degradation. Reaching the upper-temperature limits for mesophilic operation was associated with the decrease in microbial abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which are linked to syntrophic phenol degradation. It was also found that the particle size decreased from 89.4\u202fμm\u202fat 35\u202f°C to 21.0\u202fμm\u202fat 55\u202f°C. The accumulation of small particles and higher content of soluble microbial protein-like substances led to increased transmembrane pressure which negatively affected the filtration performance. Our findings indicated that at high salinity a mesophilic AnMBR can tolerate a temperature up to 45\u202f°C without being limited in the phenol conversion capacity."""
30216812	2018	'Metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) is one of the most commonly used techniques for selective isolation phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides. This technique is capable of capturing the phosphorylated biomolecules through the affinity of the phosphoryl group for metal oxides/hydroxides. Fly-ash (FA), a by-product of coal-combustion power plants, is primarily composed of oxides of silicon and metals, among which iron and titanium. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential of these metal oxides for phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide enrichment. FA is annually produced over hundred million tons worldwide and generally considered as hazardous waste. It is thus of great importance to enhance its utilization. Here we present the first demonstration of the utility of FA as a low-cost MOAC material for the enrichment of phosphoproteins. With an FA-microcolumn, phosphoproteins can be successfully sequestered from other proteins. FA-microcolumns are shown to be simple, cheap and selective devices for phosphoprotein enrichment from a small volume of mixtures.'
30216799	2018	'Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a medical emergency that is often associated with multiple organ failure and high mortality. Although an SAP diagnosis requires prompt treatment, therapeutic options remain limited. SRT1720 is a newly formulatedSIRT1 activator that exerts multiple pharmacological activities with beneficial health effects. However, its potential as an SAP treatment has not been explored. The current study assessed the effect of SRT1720 on a rat model of sodium taurocholate-induced SAP and explored the underlying mechanism. SAP was induced in rats by retrograde injection of a 3.5% sodium taurocholate solution (1\u2009ml/kg) in the biliopancreatic duct. SRT1720 (5\u2009mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally after sodium taurocholate exposure. Serum samples were analysed for inflammatory cytokine levels and select enzymatic activities using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and commercial enzyme activity assay kits, respectively; protein expression levels were evaluated by western blotting; mRNA levels of biomarkers were determined by quantitative real-time PCR; histopathological changes were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry.SRT1720 treatment significantly reduced serum amylase, lipase, pancreatic histological scores, proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) levels, and expression of NF-κB and p65 in sodium taurocholate-induced SAP rats. Importantly, the treatment stimulated SIRT1 and IκBα levels in pancreatic tissue. Our data suggest that SRT1720 protects rats from sodium taurocholate-induced SAP by suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway.'
30216787	2018	'Schizophrenia and major depression are associated with alterations in peripheral inflammatory markers, and anti-inflammatory therapy has been proposed as a promising add-on approach in the pharmacologic treatment of both disorders. Second-generation atypical antipsychotics are currently first-line drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and are also used as augmentation strategies in treatment-resistant major depression. Furthermore, these drugs have been reported to exhibit distinct metabolic side effects and to influence inflammatory processes. In this study, we used ex vivo stimulation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood donors with atypical antipsychotics olanzapine or aripiprazole to examine effects on cytokine production independent from metabolic side effects and disease status. Both olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation decreased mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and resulted in diminished protein concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α in conditioned medium of stimulated PBMC. A multiplex approach revealed additional downregulation of IL-2; MIP-1β and IP-10 secretion. Similarly, olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 resulted in a significant decrease in expression and secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α. Our results suggest that atypical antipsychotics directly influence immune cell function and thereby highlight the importance to factor in potential side effects of drugs routinely used in treatment of schizophrenia and major depression on inflammatory processes when considering anti-inflammatory drug therapy as an additional treatment option.'
30216763	2018	'Sorcin (Soluble resistance related calcium binding protein) is a small soluble penta EF family (PEF) of calcium (Ca) binding protein (22,000 Da). It has been reported to play crucial roles in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, cancer development, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of sorcin has been reported to be associated with different cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, etc. Essentially, expression of sorcin has been found to be elevated in cancer cells as compared to normal cells, indicating that it has prominent role in cancer. Moreover, sorcin was found to be the regulator of various proteins that has an association with carcinogenesis including NF-κB, STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, VEGF, MMPs, caspases, etc. Sorcin was also found to regulate apoptosis, as silencing of the same resulted in increased levels of proapoptotic genes and induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cancer. Interestingly, mutations in the sorcin gene have been closely linked with poor overall survival in bladder cancer, brain lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Additionally, overexpression of sorcin was also found to induce MDR against different chemotherapeutic drugs. All these findings mark the importance of sorcin in cancer development and MDR. Therefore, there is urgent need to explore the functional mechanism of sorcin and to analyze whether silencing of sorcin would able to chemosensitize MDR cells. The current review summarizes the structure, expression, and functions of sorcin and its importance in the regulation of various malignancies and MDR.'
30216760	2018	'Bombyx mori silk extracts, derived from the cocoon degumming process of draw and dye silk in the textile industry, are mainly composed of sericin protein. To add value to the Thai silk extracts, and hence the silk industry, a simple enrichment process was recently developed and the enriched silk extracts were then applied in nano-cosmeceutical products and nano-delivery systems. In this study, the protective effect of Thai silk extracts from three different strains of Bombyx mori on the drug-induced phototoxicity was evaluated in vitro using chlorpromazine (CPZ), a commonly used antipsychotic drug, as a representative phototoxic drug. The human epidermal A431 cell line and reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) model were used as the in vitro skin model. The silk extracts significantly improved the viability of A431 cells after CPZ exposure and ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, as shown by the significantly increased CPZ and UVA IC values and the decreased proportion of apoptotic cells. The protective effect of these silk extracts against the CPZ-induced UVA-phototoxicity in A431 cells was associated with the attenuation of intracellular oxidative stress via an increased intracellular glutathione level. Likewise, the silk extracts exhibited a protective effect on the CPZ-induced UVA-phototoxicity in the RhE model, in terms of an improved tissue viability and attenuation of the released inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1α. These findings support the potential usefulness of silk extracts in novel applications, especially in the protection of drug-induced phototoxicity.'

While oxidants may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease, evidence continues to emerge that shows these species also play important regulatory roles in health. A major mechanism of oxidant sensing and signaling involves their reaction with reactive cysteine thiols within proteins, inducing oxidative posttranslational modifications that can couple to altered function to enable homeostatic regulation. Protein kinase A and protein kinase G are regulated by oxidants in this way, and this review focuses on our molecular-level understanding of these events and their role in regulating cardiovascular physiology during health and disease.

30216733	2018	'BRAF V600E is the most common mutation in conventional ameloblastoma (AM) of the mandible. In contrast, maxillary AMs appear to harbor more frequently RAS, FGFR2, or SMO mutations. Unicystic ameloblastoma (UAM) is considered a less aggressive variant of ameloblastoma, amenable to more conservative treatment, and classified as a distinct entity. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutation profile of UAM ( n\u2009=\u200939) and to compare it to conventional AM ( n\u2009=\u200939). The associations between mutation status and recurrence probability were also analyzed. In the mandible, 94% of UAMs (29/31, including 8/8 luminal, 6/8 intraluminal, and 15/15 mural subtypes) and 74% of AMs (28/38) revealed BRAF V600E mutations. Among the BRAF wild-type cases, 1 UAM showed a missense SMO mutation (p.L412F), whereas 2 NRAS (p.Q61R), 2 HRAS (p.Q61R), and 2 FGFR2 (p.C383R) activating mutations were identified in AM. Of the 3 maxillary UAMs, only 1 revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate high frequency of activating BRAF V600E mutations in both UAM and AM of the mandible. In maxillary UAMs, the BRAF V600E mutation prevalence appears to be lower as was shown for AM previously. It could therefore be argued that UAM and AM are part of the spectrum of the same disease. AMs without BRAF V600E mutations were associated with an increased rate of local recurrence ( P = 0.0003), which might indicate that routine mutation testing also has an impact on prognosis.'

In this work, we exploit these sequences by conjugating them to soluble globular domains to develop molecular adhesives that enable sensitive, controlled self-assembly of these proteins into supramolecular architectures. In particular, we used the enzyme adenylate kinase and the green fluorescent protein as soluble domains, and we show that the addition of low complexity regions induces the formation of protein particles via a multi-step process. This multi-step pathway involves an initial liquid-liquid phase transition, which creates protein-rich droplets that mature into protein aggregates over time. These protein aggregates consist of permeable structures that maintain activity and release active soluble proteins. We show that the LCDs dictate specific non-covalent intermolecular interactions and phase properties that are largely independent of the given globular domain. We further demonstrate that this feature, together with the dynamic state of the initial dense liquid phase, allows one to directly assemble different globular domains within the same architecture, thereby enabling the generation of both static multifunctional biomaterials and dynamic microscale bioreactors.'
30216714	2018	'Whilst pharmaceuticals are now routinely detected in aquatic environments, we know little of the biological activity their presence might provoke. It is estimated that nearly 40% of all marketed pharmaceuticals are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-acting pharmaceuticals. Here, we applied an in vitro assay, called the TGFα shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of GPCRs-acting pharmaceuticals present in effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan from 2014 to 2016. The results indicated that compounds were present in the wastewater with antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (β1), acetylcholine (M1) and histamine (H1) receptors in both countries. The most consistent and powerful antagonistic activity was against the H1, D2, and AT1 receptors at up to μg-antagonist-equivalent quantity/L. Chemical analysis of the same UK samples were also conducted in parallel. Comparing the results of the bioassay with the chemical analysis indicated; 1) the existence of other D2 or M1 receptor antagonist(s) besides sulpiride (D2 antagonist) or pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) in wastewater; and 2) there might be a mixture effect between agonist and antagonistic activities against β1 receptor. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be paid more attention in the environmental monitoring and toxicity testing in future studies.'
30216708	2018	'AIM/INTRODUCTION: Recent studies advocate that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) have direct antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in the vasculature; however, the role of ω-3 PUFAs in Schwann cells remains undetermined.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Immortalized mouse Schwann (IMS32) cells were incubated with the ω-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The mRNA levels of several antioxidant enzymes [heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), catalase (Cat), superoxide dismutase (Sod), and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx)] were identified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ho-1 and Nqo1 protein levels were evaluated using Western blotting. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) of the nuclear fraction was also quantified using Western blotting. Catalase activity and glutathione (GSH) contents were determined by colorimetric assay kits. Nrf2 promoter-luciferase activity was evaluated by a dual luciferase assay system.\n\nRESULTS: Treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) decreased cell viability dose-dependently. DHA or EPA pretreatment significantly alleviated tBHP-induced cytotoxicity. DHA or EPA increased the mRNA levels of Ho-1, Nqo1, and Cat dose-dependently. Ho-1 protein level, catalase activity, Nrf2 promoter-luciferase activity, and intracellular GSH contents were significantly increased by DHA and EPA.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that DHA and EPA can induce Ho-1 and catalase via Nrf2, thus protecting Schwann cells against oxidative stress. ω-3 PUFAs appear to exert their neuroprotective effect by increasing defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in diabetic neuropathies.

30216703	2018	'BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has not been fully elucidated. This study sought to explore the role and mechanism of transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6) in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP.\n\nMETHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to evaluate TRPC6 immunolabeling. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to assay TRPC6, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in 70 patients with CRSwNP, including eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP) or non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (nECRSwNP), and 28 control subjects. The concentrations of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-5, and IL-25, were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In experiments on human nasal epithelial cell (HNEC) culture and stimulation, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of intracellular Ca was assayed by flow cytometry. Western blotting, real-time PCR, and ELISA were also conducted to assess the effects and mechanisms of TRPC6 activator 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) and TRPC6 inhibitor 1-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy]ethyl-1H-imidazole (SKF-96365) on HNECs.\n\nRESULTS: Upregulation of TRPC6, STIM1, and Orai1 levels was found in CRSwNP patients, particularly in those with ECRSwNP. TRPC6-positive cells correlated positively with the numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively. Moreover, TRPC6 mRNA was positively correlated with STIM1 and Orai1 mRNA levels. The concentrations of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-5, and IL-25, were elevated in CRSwNP, especially in ECRSwNP. In cultured HNECs, TRPC6, STIM1, Orai1, Ca MFI levels, and inflammatory mediators were upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and OAG but were inhibited by SKF-96365.\n\nCONCLUSION: TRPC6 plays a pro-inflammatory role in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP via regulating Ca flow.'
30216694	2018	"'This review will focus on the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the development of drug resistance in melanoma. Resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (MAPKi) in melanoma is observed months after treatment, a phenomenon that is often attributed to the incredible plasticity of melanoma cells but may also depend on the TME. The TME is unique in its cellular composition - it contains fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, adipocytes and amongst others. In addition, the TME provides ""non-homeostatic"" levels of oxygen, nutrients (hypoxia and metabolic stress) and extracellular matrix proteins, creating a pro-tumorigenic niche that drives resistance to MAPKi treatment. In this review, we will focus in how changes in the tumor microenvironment regulate MAPKi resistance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'"
30216693	2018	'BACKGROUND: This study was performed to test the therapeutic potential of obestatin, an autocrine anabolic factor regulating skeletal muscle repair, to ameliorate the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) phenotype.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using a multidisciplinary approach, we characterized the ageing-related preproghrelin/GPR39 expression patterns in tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of 4-, 8-, and 18-week-old mdx mice (n\xa0=\xa03/group) and established the effects of obestatin administration at this level in 8-week-old mdx mice (n\xa0=\xa05/group). The findings were extended to in vitro effects on human immortalized DMD myotubes. An analysis of TAs revealed an age-related loss of preproghrelin expression, as precursor of obestatin, in mdx mice. Administration of obestatin resulted in a significant increase in tetanic specific force (33.0%\xa0±\xa01.5%, P\xa0<\xa00.05), compared with control mdx mice. Obestatin-treated TAs were characterized by reduction of fibres with centrally located nuclei (10.0%\xa0±\xa01.2%, P\xa0<\xa00.05) together with an increase in the number of type I fibres (25.2%\xa0±\xa01.7%, P\xa0<\xa00.05) associated to histone deacetylases/myocyte enhancer factor-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α axis, and down-regulation of ubiquitin E3-ligases by inactivation of FoxO1/4, indexes of muscle atrophy. Obestatin reduced the level of contractile damage and tissue fibrosis. These observations correlated with decline in serum creatine kinase (58.8\xa0±\xa015.2, P\xa0<\xa00.05). Obestatin led to stabilization of the sarcolemma by up-regulation of utrophin, α-syntrophin, β-dystroglycan, and α7β1-integrin proteins. These pathways were also operative in human DMD myotubes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the potential of obestatin as a peptide therapeutic for preserving muscle integrity in DMD, thus allowing a better efficiency of gene or cell therapy in a combined therapeutic approach.'
30216681	2018	'Compounds with activity at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT and α adrenergic receptors have potential for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, drug addiction or overdose. Isolaureline, dicentrine and glaucine enantiomers were synthesised and their in vitro functional activities at human 5-HT and adrenergic α receptor subtypes were evaluated. The enantiomers of isolaureline and dicentrine acted as antagonists at 5-HT and α receptors with (R)-isolaureline showing the greatest potency (pK = 8.14 at the 5-HT receptor). Both (R)- and (S)-glaucine also antagonised α receptors, but they behaved very differently to the other compounds at 5-HT receptors: (S)-glaucine acted as a partial agonist at all three 5-HT receptor subtypes, whereas (R)-glaucine appeared to act as a positive allosteric modulator at the 5-HT receptor.

30216674	2018	"""Protein misfolding resulting in the formation of ordered amyloid aggregates is associated with a number of devastating human diseases. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) do not autonomously fold up into a unique stable conformation and remain as an ensemble of rapidly fluctuating conformers. Many IDPs are prone to convert into the β-rich amyloid-state. One such amyloidogenic IDP is α-synuclein that is involved in Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have indicated that other neuronal proteins, especially IDPs, can co-aggregate with α-synuclein in many pathological ailments. This article describes several such observations highlighting the role of heterotypic protein-protein interactions in the formation of hetero-amyloids. We believe that the characterizations of molecular crosstalks between amyloidogenic proteins as well as the mechanistic studies of heterotypic protein aggregation will allow us to decipher the role of the interacting proteins in amyloid proteomics.

LD proteomic research has provided fundamentally important insights into this organelle's functions. The review provides a summary of LD proteomic studies conducted across diverse organisms and cell and tissue types. The accumulated proteomic data are reviewed for evidence of a protein targeting mechanism for the organelle. We provide hypotheses for several specific localization mechanisms based on what is known about targeting mechanisms for other organelles and vesicles. Although the nature of the mechanism is not known, the functional data demonstrate that the targeting mechanism and, indeed, the organelle itself, is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

30216669	2018	'Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has become an essential tool in the study of proteins. With the advent of modern MS machines huge amounts of data is being generated which can only be processed by novel algorithmic tools. However, in the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth datasets algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility is a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to simulate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers many configuration options to allow the user a great degree of control over the test datasets which can enable rigorous and large- scale testing of any proteomics algorithm. We assessed MaSS-Simulator by comparing its performance against experimentally generated spectra and spectra obtained from NIST collections of spectral library. Our results showed that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra matched closely with real-spectra and had a relative-error distribution centered around 25%. In contrast the theoretical spectra for same peptides had relative-error distribution centered around 150%. MaSS-Simulator will enable developers to specifically highlight the capabilities of their algorithms and provide a strong proof of any pitfalls they might face.

30216667	2018	'In veterinary medicine, assay performance is often affected by the lack of species-specific diagnostic tools. Reliable biomarkers might be identified by investigating biological fluids of the species of interest, but protein sequence databases are often incomplete and human-specific devices for reducing sample complexity might fail when applied to animal plasma. Here, seven commercial methods based on different capturing agents (anti-human antibodies, affinity ligands, mixture of antibodies and ligands, and combinatorial peptide ligand libraries) were applied to cat plasma and evaluated in terms of yield, identified proteins/ peptides, and relative abundance by high resolution shotgun proteomics and label-free quantitation. As a result, anti-human antibody-based methods were unsatisfactory. Most failed in reducing albumin and immunoglobulins, and some led to a substantial removal of other highly abundant proteins, probably because of nonspecific interactions. A protein A/dye ligand-based method was efficient in reducing immunoglobulins, fibrinogen and apolipoprotein A1 and A2, but not albumin, and protein identifications did not increase. Only peptide ligand libraries flattened the dynamic range, and increased protein identification (59.0%). Albumin and immunoglobulins were successfully depleted (60.7% and 35.9%, respectively). Although further studies will be required for reinforcing our observations, this work can provide a useful guide for cat plasma pretreatment in biomarker discovery studies.

30216664	2018	'In this study, chitosan/bioactive glass (BG)/lawsone coatings were deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on polyetheretherketone (PEEK)/BG layers (previously deposited by EPD on 316-L stainless steel) to produce bioactive and antibacterial coatings. First, the EPD of chitosan/BG/lawsone was optimized on stainless steel in terms of suspension stability, homogeneity and thickness of coatings. Subsequently, the optimized EPD parameters were used to produce bioresorbable chitosan/bioactive glass (BG)/lawsone coatings on PEEK/BG layers. The produced layered coatings were characterized in terms of composition, microstructure, corrosion resistance, in vitro bioactivity, drug release kinetics and antibacterial activity. Ultraviolet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopic analyses confirmed the release of lawsone from the coatings. Moreover, the deposition of chitosan/BG coatings was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The coated specimens presented higher corrosion resistance (10 times) in comparison to that of bare 316-L stainless steel and showed convenient wettability for initial protein attachment. The presence of lawsone in the top layer provided antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus carnosus. Moreover, the developed coatings formed apatite-like crystals upon immersion in simulated body fluid, indicating the possibility of achieving close interaction between the coating surface and bone. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30216659	2018	'Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family and is able to act cardioprotective. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of IL-33 by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and bisphosphonates (BPs) in human cardiac tissue. The lipophilic fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin as well as the nitrogenous BPs alendronate and ibandronate, but not hydrophilic pravastatin increased IL-33 mRNA and intracellular IL-33 protein levels in both human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) and fibroblasts (HACF). Additionally, fluvastatin reduced soluble ST2 secretion from HACM. IL-33 was also up-regulated by the general inhibitor of prenylation perillic acid, a RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and by latrunculin B, but statin-induced IL-33 expression was inhibited by mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and RhoA activator U-46619. The IL-33 promoter was 2.3-fold more accessible in statin-treated HACM compared to untreated cells (P\xa0=\xa00.037). In explanted hearts of statin-treated patients IL-33 protein was up-regulated as compared with the hearts of non-statin-treated patients (P\xa0=\xa00.048). As IL-33 was previously shown to exert cardioprotective effects, one could speculate that such up-regulation of IL-33 expression in human cardiac cells, which might happen mainly through protein geranylgeranylation, could be a novel mechanism contributing to known cardioprotective effects of statins and BPs.'
30216658	2018	'Warsaw breakage syndrome (WBS) is a recently recognized DDX11-related rare cohesinopathy, characterized by severe prenatal and postnatal growth restriction, microcephaly, developmental delay, cochlear anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss. Only seven cases have been reported in the English literature, and thus the information on the phenotype and genotype of this interesting condition is limited. We provide clinical and molecular information on five additional unrelated patients carrying novel bi-allelic variants in the DDX11 gene, identified via whole exome sequencing. One of the variants was found to be a novel Saudi founder variant. All identified variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic except for one that was initially classified as a variant of unknown significance (VOUS) (p.Arg378Pro). Functional characterization of this VOUS using heterologous expression of wild type and mutant DDX11 revealed a marked effect on protein stability, thus confirming pathogenicity of this variant. The phenotypic data of the seven WBS reported patients were compared to our patients for further phenotypic delineation. Although all the reported patients had cochlear hypoplasia, one patient also had posterior labyrinthine anomaly. We conclude that while the cardinal clinical features in WBS (microcephaly, growth retardation, and cochlear anomalies) are almost universally present, the breakage phenotype is highly variable and can be absent in some cases. This report further expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and molecular features of WBS.'
30216645	2018	'BACKGROUND: Concerns about breast cancer had become the most dangerous cancer to women over the world, more and more anti-cancer agents are developed to treat this malignancy. Pharmorubicin is a cytotoxic drug, widely used in the treatment of breast cancer, but its role is limited because of chemoresistance produced by cells. This study focused on exploring the influence of autophagy on the resistance of pharmorubicin in breast cancer cells.\n\nMETHODS: The cell survival of breast cancer cells was detected by MTT. The mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was tested by qRT-PCR. The protein expression of HO-1, autophagic proteins (LC3-I,LC3-II and Beclin-1), PI3K and Akt was detected by Western blot. Cell autophagy was examined by Cyto-ID Autophagy Detection Kit.\n\nRESULTS: After being treated with pharmorubicin, the expression of HO-1 and autophagy related proteins was significantly enhanced, but the cell survival ratio in the two cell lines decreased. After autophagy was inhibited, HO-1 expression in two cells was down-regulated. When pharmorubicin-resistant cells were transfected with si-HO-1, the cell survival decreased and the protein expression of HO-1, autophagic proteins (LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1) as well as autophagy were all down-regulated, while in pharmorubicin-resistant cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-HO-1, the results were reverse. When the PI3K or Akt was inhibited, PI3K, p-Akt, HO-1, autophagic proteins and autophagy were decreased remarkably.\n\nCONCLUSION: It was proved that HO-1 induction mediated chemoresistance of pharmorubicin in breast cancer cells by promoting autophagy via PI3K/Akt pathway.'
30216631	2018	'We describe a set of proteins in which a βγ-crystallin domain pairs with an Ig-like domain, and which are confined to microbes, like bacteria, slime molds, and fungi. DdCAD-1 (Ca -dependent cell adhesion molecule-1) and APP (Abundant Perithecial Protein) represent this class of molecules. Using the crystal structure of APP-NTD (N-terminal domain of APP), we describe its mode of Ca binding and provide a generalized theme for correct identification of the Ca -binding site within this class of molecules. As a common feature, one of the two Ca -binding sites is non-functional in the βγ-crystallin domains of these proteins. While APP-NTD binds Ca with a micromolar affinity which is comparable to DdCAD-1, APP surprisingly does not bind Ca . Crystal structures of APP and Ca -bound APP-NTD reveal that the interface interactions\xa0in APP render\xa0its Ca -binding site inoperative. Thus, heterodomain association provides a novel mode of Ca binding regulation in APP. Breaking the interface interactions (mutating Asp30Ala, Leu132Ala, and Ile135Ala) or separation from the Ig-like domain removes the constraints upon the required conformational transition\xa0and enables the βγ-crystallin domain to bind Ca . In mechanistic detail, our work demonstrates an interdomain interface adapted to distinct functional niches in APP and its homolog DdCAD-1. This article is protected by copyright.

Changing from an agricultural to an industrial society may affect family roles and child-care practices. The present study aims to reveal family attitudes, knowledge and practices focusing on complementary feeding (CF).\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three Child Health Clinics in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Self-administered questionnaires were given to families caring for healthy infants and children less than 18\u2009months of age during October to November 2016.\n\nRESULTS: One-hundred and eight respondents completed questionnaires. The study found different attitudes and knowledge gaps between the respondents who were mothers and other family members ('others'). The 'others' were less likely to value CF as a crucial factor promoting child growth and development. Moreover, they had misperceptions about the benefits of animal-based protein and were less confident in their ability to feed the child properly. Most families reported timely introduction of complementary food, using proper milk products and encouraging age-appropriate feeding methods. However, there were undesirable practices including delaying introduction of animal-based protein, inadequate food diversity, the use of seasoning, feeding premasticated food and offering food as a reward.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that nutritional education should be extended to all caregivers involved in CF to improve the adherence to feeding recommendations."""
30216610	2018	'We sought to investigate site-specific expression of bone-regulatory factors expressed by human dental follicles and to compare the stimulated expression of tumour necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11/tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11b (RANKL/OPG) in human dental follicle cells (HDFCs) from different patients. Analysis of bone-regulatory markers in follicles from 12 different study participants was performed using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence; apical and coronal segments from each dental follicle were processed independently. Four additional dental follicles were used for cell cultures; HDFCs were precultured in osteogenic medium to initiate differentiation and thereafter cultured with 10 M forskolin (FSK) to activate the protein kinase cAMP (PKA/cAMP) signalling pathway and induce RANKL/OPG expression. We demonstrate that RANKL expression is significantly higher in the coronal part of follicles than in the apical part. High levels of collagen type 1 (COL1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Gap-junction protein, alpha 1, 43 kDa (CX43) were expressed, whereas expression of Sp7 transcription factor (OSX), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP1), and OPG was low in all samples. The immunofluorescence localization of CSF-1, MCP1, osteocalcin (OCN), RANKL, and BMP2 was not specific for either part of the follicles. In conclusion, a consistently high expression of CX43 suggests that gap-junction communication in HDFCs is essential for the eruption process. Furthermore, the induced expression of RANKL in HDFCs varies significantly between individuals and may relate to clinical variations in tooth eruption.'
30216608	2018	'The rational combination of techniques from the fields of nanotechnology, single molecule detection, and lead discovery could provide elegant solutions to enhance the throughput of drug screening. We have synthesized nanoarrays of small pharmacophores on DNA origami substrates that are displayed either as individual ligands or as fragment pairs and thereby reduced the feature size by several orders of magnitude, as compared with standard microarray techniques. Atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule detection allowed us to distinguish potent protein-ligand interactions from weak binders. Several independent binding events, i.e., strong binding, weak binding, symmetric bidentate binding, and asymmetric bidentate binding are directly visualized and evaluated. We apply this method to the discovery of bidentate trypsin binders based on benzamidine paired with aromatic fragments. Pairing of benzamidine with the dye TAMRA results in tenfold enhancement of the trypsin binding yield.'
30216604	2018	'Semi-synthetic cyclic peptides containing both non-proteinogenic building blocks as the synthetic part and a genetically encoded sequence amenable to DNA-based randomization hold great potential to expand the chemical space in the quest for novel bioactive peptides. Key to an efficient selection of novel binders to biomacromolecules is a robust method to link their genotype and phenotype. We have developed a novel bacterial cell surface display technology to present cyclic peptides composed of a synthetic and a genetically encoded fragment in their backbones. The fragments were combined by protein trans-splicing and an intramolecular oxime ligation. To this end, a split intein half and an unnatural amino acid were displayed with the genetically encoded part on the surface of E. coli. Addition of the synthetic fragment equipped with the split intein partner and an aminooxy moiety as well as the application of a pH-shift protocol resulted in the on-surface formation of the semi-synthetic cyclic peptide. Our approach will serve for the generation of cyclic peptide libraries suitable for selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and more generally enables chemical modification of proteins on the bacterial surface.'
30216582	2018	'BACKGROUND: Successful implantation of embryos requires endometrial receptivity. Calcitonin is one of the factors influencing implantation window. This study aimed to evaluate calcitonin effects on endometrial receptivity. To this end, the effects of calcitonin on the implantation window in the ovarian stimulation and the normal ovarian cycle were investigated by the morphological study of the endometrium as well as the expression of MSX.1, HB-EGF and miRNA Let-7a; then the mechanisms of calcitonin effects were studied through mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 Bulb/c mice were divided into two groups: Normal ovarian cycle and ovarian stimulation. Each group consisted of 4 subgroups: Ctrl, CT, PP242, and CT+PP242. Calcitonin and PP242 were injected on the 4th of pregnancy and 24 hours later all the mice were sacrificed. Uterine tissue samples were used for morphological analysis and the endometrial epithelial and the stromal cells were isolated from myometrium for evaluation of gene and protein expression.\n\nRESULTS: Ovarian stimulation increased the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and ERK1/2 and the expression of miRNA let-7a. Calcitonin injection increased the expression of HB-EGF, Msx.1, and miRNA Let-7a in a normal ovarian cycle and in ovarian-stimulated mice. It also increased 4EBP1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in normal ovarian cycles.\n\nCONCLUSION: Calcitonin improved the receptivity of the uterine endometrium by up-regulation of the HB-EGF, Msx.1 and miRNA Let-7a likely through mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

In the model organism Synechococcus elongatus PCC\xa07942 the central oscillator consists of the three proteins KaiA, KaiB and KaiC and utilizes the histidine kinase SasA and its response regulator RpaA as output-signaling pathway. Synechocystis\xa0sp.\xa0PCC\xa06803 contains in addition to the canonical kaiAB1C1 gene cluster two further homologs of the kaiB and kaiC genes. Here we demonstrate that the SasA-RpaA system interacts with the KaiAB1C1 core oscillator only. Interaction with KaiC2 and KaiC3 proteins was not detected, suggesting different signal transduction components for the clock homologs. Inactivation of rpaA in Synechocystis sp. PCC\xa06803 leads to reduced viability of the mutant in light-dark cycles, especially under mixotrophic growth conditions. Chemoheterotrophic growth of the ∆rpaA strain in the dark was abolished completely. Transcriptomic data revealed that RpaA is mainly involved in the regulation of genes related to CO -acclimation in the light and to carbon metabolism in the dark. Further, our results indicate a link between the circadian clock and phototaxis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'

Medical records of downer adult dairy cows presented to the hospital between January 2006 and October 2014 for which CSF analysis results were available were studied. Short-term (discharge from hospital) and long-term (completion of lactation) survival were determined and compared in accordance with CSF TNCC and protein concentration, using a Chi-square test.\n\nRESULTS: Cows with CSF TNCC and/or protein concentration above the threshold values had a significantly lower short-term survival rate (P\u2009=\u2009.02). The odds of nonsurvival of cows with one or both CSF values above the threshold values was 2.16 times higher than the odds for cows with values under the threshold values. CSF TNCC >4.5\u2009cells/μL had sensitivity and specificity of 17.3% (95% CI: 10.7%-25.7%) and 92.3% (95% CI: 85.4%-96.6%), respectively, for predicting short-term nonsurvival. CSF protein concentration >0.39\u2009g/L had sensitivity and specificity of 20.9% (95% CI: 13.7%-29.7%) and 91.4% (95% CI: 84.2%-96.0%), respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CSF analysis above threshold values used in this study is associated with increased odds of short-term nonsurvival.'
30216556	2018	"""The patient was a Japanese woman who experienced a decrease in activity and gait disturbance as the initial symptoms at the age of 86, followed by disorientation and memory dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive cortical regions with hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted images, and these regions showed swelling in T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The medial occipital cortex and striatum showed no apparent hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Mild myoclonus was detected, and the patient died 10\u2009months after the onset of symptoms; she did not enter the akinetic mutism state. The patient's brain weighed 1050\u2009g, and neuropathological examination showed extensive characteristic various-sized and non-confluent (VaSNoC) vacuoles in the cerebral cortex. These vacuoles were observable macroscopically by loupe on images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue. Gliosis, hypertrophic astrocytosis, and neuron loss were generally mild in character. Prion protein (PrP) immunostaining showed very mild diffuse-synaptic-type PrP deposition in the cerebral gray matter. These clinicopathological findings led us to several conclusions relative to the early disease pathology of V180I genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: (i) spongiform change was not found in the medial occipital cortex, which corresponds to the results of DWI; (ii) VaSNoC-type spongiform changes, extensively recognized in the cerebral cortex, corresponded to the DWI findings showing continued hyperintensity with higher brightness, and T2-weighted and FLAIR images findings showing a swelling; and (iii) spongiform changes first appear in the deeper layer and subsequently in the superficial layer in the cerebral cortex."""
30216550	2018	'BACKGROUND: Markers of kidney dysfunction and damage have potential to detect chronic kidney disease (CKD) in early stages. However, data on long-term variation of these markers in healthy dogs is lacking and is crucial for the interpretation of results.\n\nHYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine temporal variations of serum cystatin C (sCysC) and urinary retinol-binding protein (uRBP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), immunoglobulin G (uIgG), and C-reactive protein (uCRP) in healthy dogs.\n\nANIMALS: Eight clinically healthy adult Beagles were evaluated.\n\nMETHODS: Longitudinal observational study. Serum cystatin C was determined by particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay. Urinary retinol-binding protein, uNGAL, uIgG and uCRP were determined by ELISA and concentrations were indexed to urinary creatinine. Within- and between-dog variance components (VC) and within-dog coefficients of variation (CV) were determined from blood and urine collected at eight time points over 1.5 years.\n\nRESULTS: Urinary C-reactive protein (uCRP) concentrations were consistently below the detection limit (5.28 ng/mL). Mean ± within-dog standard deviation for sCysC, uRBP/c, uNGAL/c and uIgG/c was 0.15 ± 0.01 mg/L, 0.09 ± 0.03 mg/g, 2.32 ± 2.03 μg/g and 12.47 ± 10.98 mg/g, respectively. Within-dog CV for sCysC, uRBP/c, uNGAL/c and uIgG/c was 8.1%, 33.7%, 87.2% and 88.1%, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Serum cystatin C, uRBP/c, uNGAL/c and uIgG/c exhibit a wide range of long-term within-dog variability. Researchers and veterinarians might need to take this into account when interpreting their results. To assess their diagnostic and predictive ability, future studies need to establish reference ranges for healthy dogs and dogs with CKD.'
30216540	2018	'Deregulated proteolysis invariably underlies most human diseases including bone pathologies. Metalloproteinases constitute the largest of the five protease families, and the metzincin metalloproteinases are inhibited by the four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase called TIMPs. We hypothesized that Timp genes are essential for skeletal homeostasis. We bred individual Timp knockout mice to generate unique mouse models, the quadruple Timp null strain (QT) as well as mice harboring only a single Timp3 allele (QT3 ). QT mice are grossly smaller and exhibit a dramatic reduction of trabeculae in long bones by µCT imaging with a corresponding increase in metalloproteinase activity. At the cellular level, Timp deficiency compromised differentiation markers, matrix deposition and mineralization in neonatal osteoblasts from calvariae, as well as the CFU-F capacity of bone marrow derived stromal cells. In contrast, we observed that osteoclasts were overactive in the Timp null state, consistent with the noted excessive bone resorption of QT bones. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses of bone sections revealed higher Cathepsin K and RANKL signals upon Timp loss. Seeking the molecular mechanism, we identified abnormal TNFα bioactivity to be a central event in Timp deficient mice. Specifically, TNFα triggered induction of the Wnt signaling inhibitor Dkk1 in the osteoblasts at the mRNA and protein levels, with a simultaneous increase in RANKL. Neutralizing TNFα antibody was capable of rescuing the induction of Dkk1 as well as RANKL. Therefore, the generation of novel Timp deficient systems allowed us to uncover the essential and collective function of TIMP proteins in mammalian long bone homeostasis. Moreover, our study discovers a functional TIMP/metalloproteinase-TNFα-Dkk1/RANKL nexus for optimal control of the bone microenvironment which dictates co-existence of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineages.

30216523	2018	'Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the main causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important biological process involving the process by which malignant tumor cells obtain the ability of migration, invasion, resistance of apoptosis, and degradation in the extracellular matrix. The current study aimed at investigating whether bone marrow X kinase Rho GTPase activating protein 12 (BMX-ARHGAP) fusion gene affects GC. First, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against BMX-ARHGAP or BMX-ARHGAP were introduced to treat SGC-7901 cells with the highest BMX-ARHGAP among the five GC cell lines (SGC-7901, MKN-45, NCI-N87, SNU-5, and AGS). Next, cell vitality, drug resistance, migration, and invasion of SGC-7901 cells, activities of Rho and JAK/STAT axis, as well as EMT and lymph node metastasis (LNM) were evaluated. The survival rate of the mice was then determined through the transfection of the specific pathogen-free NOD-SCID mice with treated SGC-7901 cells. The results showed that BMX-ARHGAP expression was associated with the infiltration degree of GC tumor and poor prognosis for patients with GC. BMX-ARHGAP silencing was found to play an inhibitory role in the Rho and JAK/STAT axis to reduce cell vitality, drug resistance, migration and invasion, reverse EMT process, as well as inhibit LNM. BMX-ARHGAP overexpression was observed to have induced effects on GC cells as opposed to those inhibited by BMX-ARHGAP silencing. The survival rate of mice was increased after transfection with silenced BMX-ARHGAP. These findings provided evidence that the suppression of BMX-ARHGAP resulted in the inhibition of RhoA to restraint the development of GC cells by blocking the JAK/STAT axis.'
30216512	2018	'Ribosomal protein L34 (RPL34), belonging to the L34E family of ribosomal proteins, was reported to be dysregulated in several types of cancers and plays important roles in tumor progression. However, the expression and roles of RPL34 in human glioma remain largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the expression and role of RPL34 in glioma. We report here that RPL34 is highly expressed in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of RPL34 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as prevented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in glioma cells. Further, mechanistic analysis showed that knockdown of RPL34 significantly downregulated the levels of p-JAK and p-STAT3 in glioma cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that knockdown of RPL34 inhibits the proliferation and migration of glioma cells through the inactivation of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, RPL34 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.'
30216510	2018	'Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a condition\xa0associated with high rates of mortality and lengthy hospital stays. In the current study, SAP mouse models were established in BALB/c wild-type and P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) knockdown mice with the objective of determining the expression of microRNA-542-5p (miR-542-5p) and the subsequent elucidation of the mechanism by which it influences acute lung injury (ALI) by mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and binding to PAK1. The targeting relationship between miR-542-5p and PAK1 was verified using the bioinformatics prediction website and by the means of a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Following the SAP model establishment, the mice were assigned into various groups with the introduction of different mimic and inhibitors in an attempt to investigate the effects involved with miR-542-5p on inflammatory reactions among mice with SAP-associated ALI. Our results indicated that PAK1 was targeted and negatively mediated by miR-542-5p. Mice with SAP-associated ALI exhibited an increased wet-to-dry weight ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, serum amylase activity, TNF-α, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) contents, p-p38MAPK, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK protein levels as well as PAK1 positive expression, while decreased miR-542-5p levels were observed. Functionally, overexpression of miR-542-5p improves ALI in mice with SAP via inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway by binding to PAK1.Based on the evidence from experimental models, miR-542-5p was shown to improve ALI among mice with SAP, while suggesting that the effect may be related to the inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway and downregulation of PAK1 gene. Thus, miR-542-5p could serve as a promising target for ALI treatment.'
30216507	2018	"'Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are used to internalize different cargoes, including DNA, into live mammalian and plant cells. Despite many cells being easily transfected with this approach, other cells are rather ""difficult"" or ""hard to transfect,"" including protist cells of the genus Leishmania. Based on our previous results in successfully internalizing proteins into Leishmania tarentolae cells, we used single CPPs and three different DNA-binding proteins to form protein-like complexes with plasmids covered with CPPs. We attempted magnetofection, electroporation, and transfection using a number of commercially available detergents. While complex formation with negatively charged DNA required substantially higher amounts of CPPs than those necessary for mostly neutral proteins, the cytotoxicity of the required amounts of CPPs and auxiliaries was thoroughly studied. We found that Leishmania cells were indeed susceptible to high concentrations of some CPPs and auxiliaries, although in a different manner compared with that for mammalian cells. The lack of successful transfections implies the necessity to accept certain general limitations regarding DNA internalization into difficult-to-transfect cells. Only electroporation allowed reproducible internalization of large and rigid plasmid DNA molecules through electrically disturbed extended membrane areas, known as permeable membrane macrodomains.'"
30216505	2018	'Recent studies have shown that microRNA (miRNAs) can play important roles in the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) function. However, the expression profile of miRNAs and their effects on the apoptosis of ECs under microgravity conditions remains unclear. In this study, the apoptosis of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) under simulated microgravity was identified by Annexin V and propidium iodide double staining and transmission electron microscopy. miRNA microarray assay was used to screen the differentially expressed miRNAs in HPMECs under simulated microgravity, and eight differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Specifically, miR-503-5p, which was found to be most significantly upregulated in both microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays, was selected for further functional investigation. Overexpression of miR-503-5p induced apoptosis of HPMECs under normal gravity and aggravated the negative effects of simulated microgravity on HPMECs. Furthermore, silencing of miR-503-5p expression effectively attenuated the negative effects of simulated microgravity on HPMECs. Further experiments showed that the mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), which has been confirmed as a direct target of miR-503-5p, was inhibited by the upregulation of miR-503-5p and increased by the downregulation of miR-503-5p. Taken together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that miR-503-5p can induce apoptosis of HPMECs under simulated microgravity through, at least in part, inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2.'
30216501	2018	'Mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma (GBM), identified as one of four clinically relevant molecular subtypes, has worst prognosis because of its close relation with the malignant biological properties induced by glial-mesenchymal transition (GMT). However, the molecular mechanism of GMT and its characterized molecule of GBM have not been studied. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is at a convergence point of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling as one of the three core pathways implicated in GBM. Our previous study indicated that the inactivation of FOXO1 involved in the inhibition of GMT is an independent prognosis factor of GBM. In this study, we will further confirm the role of FOXO1 in GMT through cytological experiments to clarify how FOXO1 regulates GMT and its clinical significance. We established virus-infected FOXO1 overexpression and FOXO1 knockdown cells of U373 MG and U251 mediated by lentivirus, based on the effect of which FOXO1-correlated-GMT experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggested that FOXO1 played a crucial role in resistance to TMZ, BCNU, and CDDP; migration and invasion; and stem cell properties of glioma cells. FOXO1 may serve as a targeted biomarker for prediction of sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs, metastasis, and prognosis, which provides a new idea for mesenchymal GBM treatment.'
30216500	2018	'Chemotherapy drug resistance frequently happens in more than 50% of bladder cancer patients and is the major obstacle for the bladder cancer therapy. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is involved in the development of chemoresistance. In this study, we reported hypoxia inducible factor 1α-antisense RNA 2 (HIF1A-AS2), as a subtype-specific hypoxia inducible lncRNA, is upregulated in bladder cancer cells and tissue after cisplatin (Cis) treatment. The induction of HIF1A-AS2 in bladder cancer cells rendered resistance to Cis-induced apoptosis. Silencing HIF1A-AS2 in Cis-resistant bladder cancer cells was re-sensitized to Cis-induced apoptosis. Mechanically, we found that HIF1A-AS2 suppressed the transcription activity of p53 family proteins by promoting the expression of high-mobility group A1\xa0(HMGA1). The induction of HMGA1 physically interacts with p53, p63, and p73, and therefore constrains their transcriptional activity on Bax. Knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 or HMGA1 rescued the expression of Bax, which therefore enhanced the killing effect of Cis. Furthermore, we also found that the expression of HIF1A-AS2 was higher in the human bladder tumor tissues after Cis treatment, and was positive correlated to the expression of HIF1α and HMGA1. This study suggests that upregulated HIF1A-AS2 hampers the p53 family proteins dependent apoptotic pathway to promote Cis resistance in bladder cancer. Our data suggested that HIF1A-AS2 plays oncogenic roles and can be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer.'
30216498	2018	'Detection of proteins which may be potential biomarkers of disorders represents a big step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie pathological processes. In this context proteomics plays the important role of opening a path for the identification of molecular signatures that can potentially assist in early diagnosis of several clinical disturbances. Aim of this report is to provide an overview of the wide variety of proteomic strategies that have been applied to the investigation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a severe disorder that causes an irreversible damage to the lungs and for which there is no cure yet. The results in this area published over the past decade show that proteomics indeed has the ability of monitoring alterations in expression profiles of proteins from fluids/tissues of patients affected by COPD and healthy controls. However, these data also suggest that proteomics, while being an attractive tool for the identification of novel pathological mediators of COPD, remains a technique mainly generated and developed in research laboratories. Great efforts dedicated to the validation of these biological signatures will result in the proof of their clinical utility. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'
30216497	2018	'We previously reported that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the red nucleus (RN) is involved in pain modulation and exerts a facilitatory effect in the development of neuropathic pain. Here, we explored the actions of signaling pathways, including the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways, on RN IL-1β-mediated pain modulation. After a single dose of recombinant rat IL-1β (rrIL-1β, 10\xa0ng) injected into the RN in normal rats, a tactile allodynia was evoked in the contralateral but not ipsilateral hindpaw, commencing 75\xa0min and peaking 120\xa0min postinjection. Up-regulated protein levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and p-JNK were observed in the RN 120\xa0min after rrIL-1β injection, the increases of p-STAT3 and p-JNK were blocked by anti-IL-1β antibody. However, the expression levels of p-ERK, p-p38 MAPK, and NF-κB in the RN were not affected by rrIL-1β injection. RN neurons and astrocytes contributed to IL-1β-evoked up-regulation of p-STAT3 and p-JNK. Further studies demonstrated that injection of the JAK2 antagonist AG490 or JNK antagonist SP600125 into the RN 30\xa0min prior to the administration of rrIL-1β could completely prevent IL-1β-evoked tactile allodynia, while injection of the ERK antagonist PD98059, p38 MAPK antagonist SB203580, or NF-κB antagonist PDTC did not affect IL-1β-evoked tactile allodynia. In conclusion, our data provide additional evidence that RN IL-1β is involved in pain modulation, and that it exerts a facilitatory effect by activating the JAK/STAT3 and JNK signaling pathways.'

30216493	2018	'Cardiac fibrosis is known to be present in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and it predicts the occurrence of sudden death and congestive heart failure. The aim of our study is to investigate the expression of microRNA-132 (miR-132) and its effect on cardiocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis by binding to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) through the phosphateidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (Akt) signal transduction pathway in DCM rats. DCM rat models induced by doxorubicin were established and confirmed by an ultrasonic cardiogram. Epithelial cells were treated with inhibitors, activators, and small interfering RNAs to identify the mechanisms by which miR-132 controls cardiocyte activity and cardiac fibrosis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone (ALD) expressions were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between PTEN and miR-132 was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were tested by the MTT assay and flow cytometry. PTEN was determined to be the target gene of miR-132. Rat models of DCM exhibited a lower level of miR-132, PI3K, Akt, B-cell lymphoma 2, collagen I, and collagen III, but a higher level of PTEN, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as inflammatory response (Ang II and ALD), accompanied by declined cardiocyte proliferation and elevated apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Upregulated miR-132 or silenced PTEN activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus facilitating cardiocyte proliferation and repressing cardiocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, as well as inflammatory responses. Downregulated miR-132 reversed this tendency. These findings indicate that miR-132 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway by inhibiting PTEN expression, thus facilitating cardiocyte proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis in DCM rats.'
30216488	2018	'The correlation between lung cancer tumor markers and sex differences in lung cancer remains a clinical problem that is worthy of further study. This study investigated the significance of the combined detection of 17β-estrogen (E2) and tumor markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. A total of 174 patients, including 117 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 57 patients with benign pulmonary lesions (BPL), were enrolled. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the expression of E2, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1) in patients with NSCLC and BPL to analyze the correlation between E2 and CEA, NSE or CYFRA21-1 expression, and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression of tumor markers was then examined in different lung cancer cells (A549, H1795, H460, and SK-MES-1). The expression of tumor markers was detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expressions of p-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis. The expression levels of E2, CEA, NSE, and CYFRA21-1 in patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than those in patients with BPL ( P\u2009<\u2009.05); E2 was positively correlated with tumor markers ( P\u2009<\u2009.01). Patients with a high expression of E2 and tumor markers showed a poor prognosis\xa0( P\u2009<\u2009.05). RT-quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of CEA, NSE, CYFRA21-1, p-p44/42 MAPK, and p-AKT in the E2 group were higher than those in the other groups ( P\u2009<\u2009.05). These studies indicate that the interaction of E2 and tumor markers can significantly improve the role of tumor markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer.'

The chips are demonstrated for the detection of three phosphopeptides involved in ERBB2/MAPK signaling pathways, selected from the outcome of a proteomic study involving EGF stimulation of SKBR3/HER2+ breast cancer cells. The data demonstrate that the proposed microfluidic strategy can be used for the MS quantification of phosphopeptides in the low nM range from cell lysates without any prior sample pretreatment, fractionation or bioaffinity enrichment, and is generally applicable to the analysis of any phosphopeptide targets.

This study investigated the relationship of SND1 protein expression both with metastasis and the prognoses of 144 breast cancer patients over a 10-year follow-up. Chi-square tests revealed that the percentages of positive SND1 expression in breast cancer tumors were significantly associated with larger tumor size (>2\xa0cm, P = 0.043), higher clinical TNM stage (P = 0.003), and positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). Breast cancer patients with positive SND1 expression had a significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than those with negative SND1 expression (P <\xa00.01). Multiple Cox regression analysis indicated that SND1 expression is an independent risk factor for shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.97, P = 0.014). The percentages of SND1 expression in metastatic breast cancers were significantly higher than that in primary tumors in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer (P = 0.016). Therefore, SND1 protein expression is significantly associated with breast cancer metastasis and may serve as a biomarker for prognosis of breast cancer patients.'
30216458	2018	'Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox L.) is an important ornamental plant in China with a pleasant floral scent. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying differences in the fragrances among genotypes of this plant, we analyzed floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from two different genotypes: SW001, which has little to no fragrance, and the scented genotype H29. The major VOCs in H29 were linalool, trans-β-ocimene, benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate, benzyl alcohol, and methyl benzoate. The most important aroma-active compound in H29, linalool, was emitted at a low concentration in SW001, which had markedly higher levels of trans-β-ocimene than H29. Next, to investigate scent biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome of fully open flowers of the two genotypes. A total of 14 443 differentially expressed unigenes and 196 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Further analyses indicated that 56 differentially expressed genes involved in the terpenoid and benzenoid biosynthesis pathways might play critical roles in regulating floral fragrance difference. Disequilibrium expression of four terpene synthase genes resulted in diverse emission of linalool and trans-β-ocimene in both genotypes. In addition, the expressions of two CpMYC2 transcription factors were both upregulated in H29, implying that they may regulate linalool production. Notably, 16 of 20 genes in the benzenoid biosynthesis pathway were downregulated, corresponding to the relatively low level of benzenoid production in SW001. The lack of benzyl acetate might indicate that SW001 may lack substrate benzyl alcohol or functional acetyl-CoA: benzylalcohol acetyltransferase. This article is protected by copyright.

30216447	2018	'Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging and characterized pathologically by the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurite and synapse loss. Amyloid beta-peptide (1-42) [Aβ(1-42)], a major component of senile plaques, is neurotoxic and induces oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Redox proteomics has been used to identify proteins oxidatively modified by Aβ(1-42) in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss these proteins in the context of those identified to be oxidatively modified in animal models of AD, and human studies including Familial AD (FAD), Preclinical AD (PCAD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early AD (EAD), Late AD (LAD), Down syndrome (DS) and DS with AD (DS/AD). These redox proteomics studies indicate that Aβ(1-42)-mediated oxidative stress occurs early in AD pathogenesis and results in altered antioxidant and cellular detoxification defenses, decreased energy yielding metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, loss of synaptic plasticity and cell structure, neuroinflammation, impaired protein folding and degradation, and altered signal transduction. Improved access to biomarker imaging and the identification of lifestyle interventions or treatments to reduce Aβ production could be beneficial in preventing or delaying the progression of AD.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to clarify whether microRNA-320a (miR-320a) regulates the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of trophoblasts and endothelial cells. In this study, miR-320a mimics and inhibitors were transfected into HTR.8/SVneo cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using liposomes. Subsequently, the expression of miR-320a and estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) mRNA was detected by a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whereas the protein expression of ERRγ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenin 1 (Ang-1), human 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD3B1), and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was detected by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the proliferation, invasion/migration, and apoptosis of cells were analyzed by the cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. The results showed that overexpression of miR-320a decreased the optical density (OD) values and the proliferation rate of HTR.8/SVneo cells and HUVECs, while inhibiting the expression of VEGF, Ang-1, HSD3B1, and HCG in these cells. Furthermore, miR-320a reduced the ability of cell invasion and migration, while increasing the rate of cell apoptosis. After cotransfecting the cells with miR-320a and ERRγ small (or short) interfering RNA (siRNA), the decreased ERRγ expression led to inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, but increased apoptosis of HTR.8/SVneo cells and HUVECs. Our results further revealed that miR-320a induced the apoptosis of trophoblasts and endothelial cells while inhibiting their proliferation, migration, and invasion by decreasing the expression of ERRγ and by indirectly suppressing the expression of VEGF, Ang-1, HSD3B1, and HCG.'

In vivo, streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intraperitoneally to induce type 1 diabetes in mice. Cardiomyocyte specific HOTAIR overexpression was achieved using an adeno-associated virus system 12 weeks after STZ injection. In vitro, H9c2 were used to explore the potential molecular mechanism of HOTAIR in the regulation of high-glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to explore the relationship between HOTAIR, microRNA-34a (miR-34a), and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). HOTAIR expression was significantly decreased in diabetic mice hearts. Knockdown of HOTAIR in high glucose-induced H9c2 resulted in increased oxidative injury, inflammation, and apoptosis in vitro. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of HOTAIR improved cardiac function, decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and attenuated myocyte death in mice treated with STZ. Mechanistically, the expression of SIRT1/forkhead box protein O1 was significantly increased in the HOTAIR-overexpressing hearts compared with the control hearts treated with STZ. Moreover, we found HOTAIR functioned as a molecular sponge of miR-34a in H9c2 and SIRT1 was identified as a target of miR-34a. Furthermore, the protective effects of HOTAIR on DCM was abolished in SIRT1 deficiency mice in vivo. HOTAIR protected against DCM via activation of the SIRT1 expression by sponging miR-34a.'
30216414	2018	'The pathogenic role of IL-17 and GM-CSF has been unravelled in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in most models, EAE is characterised by a monophasic attack which is not representative of the relapsing nature nor the chronicity displayed in MS. Here, we used proteolipid protein peptide (PLP ) to trigger EAE-relapses (EAE-II) in SJL mice that had recovered from a primary-EAE episode (EAE-I). This procedure resulted in severe and irreversible disease that, unlike EAE-I, was not abolished by anti-IL-17-mAb. In contrast, prophylactic anti-GM-CSF-mAb treatment prevented EAE-I and -II. Strikingly, the expression of T-cell transcription factors and cytokines/chemokines in mice treated with anti-GM-CSF during both EAE episodes was silenced. Anti-GM-CSF-mAb treatment administered only during EAE-II did not completely prevent relapses but mice ultimately reached full recovery. Anti-GM-CSF treatment also strongly impaired and ultimately resolved monophasic MOG -induced EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. In such protected mice, anti-GM-CSF treatment also prevented a further relapse induced by MOG-revaccination. These results underscore the critical role of GM-CSF on pro-inflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, we observed a strong preventive and curative effect of anti-GM-CSF neutralisation in two EAE models, relapsing and chronic. Altogether these findings are relevant for further MS research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.'
30216407	2018	'INTRODUCTION: Our primary objective was to test the hypothesis that human epididymal protein 4 (HE4) and risk of ovarian malignancy index (ROMA) outperform CA125 and risk of malignancy index (RMI) in categorizing a pelvic mass into high or low risk of malignancy in a Swedish population. Further, cut off values needed to be defined for HE4 and ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women prior to introduction into clinical practice. A tertiary objective was to investigate the correlation between HE4 levels in serum and urine.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Women with pelvic mass scheduled for surgery were recruited from nine hospitals in southeast Sweden. Preoperative blood samples were taken for analysis of CA125 and HE4 as well as urine samples for analysis of HE4.\n\nRESULTS: We enrolled a total of 901 patients out of which 784 were evaluable. In the pre- and postmenopausal groups, no significant differences were found for sensitivity, PPV and NPV neither for RMI vs ROMA nor for CA125 vs HE4 using a fixed specificity of 75%. Cut-off values indicating malignancy were established for HE4 and ROMA in pre- and postmenopausal women. We found no correlation between HE4 concentration in serum and urine.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We could not confirm a diagnostic superiority of ROMA over RMI in categorizing patients with pelvic mass into low or high risk groups for malignancy in a Swedish population. We have defined cut-off values for HE4 and ROMA. The lack of correlation between serum and urine HE4 obviates the introduction of urine HE4 analysis into clinical diagnostics.

30216376	2018	'Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) affects poultry respiratory, renal and reproductive systems. Currently the efficacy of available live attenuated or killed vaccines against IBV has been challenged. We designed a novel IBV vaccine alternative using a highly innovative platform called Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticle (SAPN). In this vaccine, B cell epitopes derived from the second heptad repeat (HR2) region of IBV spike proteins were repetitively presented in its native trimeric conformation. In addition, flagellin was co-displayed in the SAPN to achieve a self-adjuvanted effect. Three groups of chickens were immunized at four weeks of age with the vaccine prototype, IBV-Flagellin-SAPN, a negative-control construct Flagellin-SAPN or a buffer control. The immunized chickens were challenged with 5x104.7 EID50 IBV M41 strain. High antibody responses were detected in chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN. In ex vivo proliferation tests, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from IBV-Flagellin-SAPN immunized chickens had a significantly higher stimulation index than that of PBMCs from chickens receiving Flagellin-SAPN. Chickens immunized with IBV-Flagellin-SAPN had a significant reduction of tracheal virus shedding and lesser tracheal lesion scores than did negative control chickens. The data demonstrated that the IBV-Flagellin-SAPN holds promise as a vaccine for IBV.'
30216370	2018	'SPLUNC1 is a multifunctional protein of the airway with antimicrobial properties. We previously reported that it displayed antibiofilm activities against P. aeruginosa. The goal of this study was to determine whether (1) the antibiofilm property is broad (including S. aureus, another prevalent organism in cystic fibrosis); (2) the α4 region is responsible for such activity; and (3), if so, this motif could be structurally optimized as an antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities. We used S. aureus biofilm-prevention assays to determine bacterial biomass in the presence of SPLUNC1 and SPLUNC1Δα4 recombinant proteins, or SPLUNC1-derived peptides (α4 and α4M1), using the well-established crystal-violet biofilm detection assay. The SPLUNC1Δα4 showed markedly reduced biofilm prevention compared to the parent protein. Surprisingly, the 30-residue long α4 motif alone demonstrated minimal biofilm prevention activities. However, structural optimization of the α4 motif resulted in a modified peptide (α4M1) with significantly enhanced antibiofilm properties against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus, including six different clinical strains of MRSA and the well-known USA300. Hemolytic activity was undetectable at up to 100μM for the peptides. The data warrant further investigation of α4-derived AMPs to explore the potential application of antimicrobial peptides to combat bacterial biofilm-related infections.'
30216369	2018	'Prostate cancer (PCA) is one of the most common cancer types in men, with cancer progression being linked to hypoxia and the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).We investigated the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), its regulation by HIF isoforms 1α and 2α, and its role in HIF stabilization. We additionally examined cell survival in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP under severe hypoxic (0.1% O2) and normoxic (20% O2) conditions. qRT-PCR showed higher up-regulation of PKM2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells than in PC3 cells, while western blotting showed that PKM2 protein levels were up-regulated only in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-2α by small interfering RNA (si-RNA) demonstrated HIF-1α dependent up-regulation of PKM2 at the mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells. PKM2 inhibition by si-RNA significantly decreased hypoxia-response element (HRE) activation in a gene reporter assay and down-regulated HIF-1α target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in PC3 cells, whereas HIF-1α protein levels were not significantly reduced. Additionally, PKM2 inhibition significantly reduced clonogenic survival in both cell lines in a colony formation assay. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) mRNA expression was up-regulated in both cell lines. It has been shown that PKM2 expression is regulated by HIF-1α and that PKM2 favors HIF-1α transactivation under mild (1% O2) but not severe (0.1% O2) hypoxic conditions, and some of our findings are consistent with these previous results. However, this mechanism was not fully observed in our studied cell lines, as PKM2 regulation and HIF-1α stabilization at the transactivation level occurred under severe hypoxic conditions. This discrepancy suggests that tumor tissue origin and cell type influence this model. Our findings expand the current knowledge of the mechanisms of PCA regulation, and would be important in developing novel therapeutic strategies.'
30216355	2018	'OBJECTIVES: Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is an important cardioprotective mechanism. This study aimed to investigate RCT changes in a murine model of obesity.\n\nMETHODS: Ob/ob and control mice were injected with [3H]-cholesterol-labelled macrophages and cholesterol accumulation quantified after 48 h. Ex vivo, cholesterol efflux and uptake were determined in hepatic and adipose tissues.\n\nRESULTS: Ob/ob mice had more labelled cholesterol in their plasma (86%, p<0.001), suggesting impaired RCT. SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux was elevated from ob/ob mice (serum, 33%; apoB-depleted plasma, 14%, p<0.01) and HDL-c were also higher (60%, p<0.01). Ex vivo it was found that cholesterol uptake was significantly lower into the livers and adipose tissue of ob/ob mice, compared to non-obese wildtype controls. Furthermore, ex vivo cholesterol efflux was reduced in ob/ob liver and adipose tissue towards apoA-I and HDL. Consistent with this, protein levels of SR-BI and ABCG1 were significantly lower in ob/ob hepatic and adipose tissue than in wildtype mice. Finally, labelled cholesterol concentrations were lower in ob/ob bile (67%, p<0.01) and faeces (76%, p<0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Obesity causes impairment in RCT due to reduced plasma cholesterol uptake and efflux by hepatocytes and adipocytes. A reduction in the capacity for plasma cholesterol clearance may partly account for increased CVD risk with obesity.'
30216338	2018	'Saline-alkali soil is an arable land resource on which transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton has been planted on a large scale in accordance with food security strategies. There are, however, concerns about the insecticidal effects of Bt cotton on target insect pests. In this study, a Bt cotton variety, GK19, and its nontransgenic parent variety, Simian-3, were used as experimental models for investigating the effect of the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on the feeding behavior and nutritional parameters of Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that the expression of exogenous insecticidal proteins in GK19 was significantly inhibited under NaCl stress. However, the feeding, crawling, resting and spinning down behavior of the 5th instar H. armigera larvae on GK19 Bt cotton, as well as the amount of food consumed and feces produced by these larvae, did not markedly differ under different NaCl concentrations. In contrast, the mean relative growth rate (MRGR), relative growth rate (RGR), approximate digestibility (AD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) of the larvae markedly decreased in response to NaCl stress. Under the same concentration of NaCl, the nutritional parameters of the bollworm larvae on GK19 Bt cotton or Simian-3 nontransgenic cotton were different. However, the interaction between salt stress and cotton variety had no significant effect on the feeding behavior or nutritional parameters of H. armigera larvae. These results may provide a scientific basis for determining the effect of exogenous insecticidal protein expression in Bt cotton under NaCl stress on H. armigera and can therefore be useful for the effective application of Bt cotton in saline-alkali soils to prevent and control H. armigera.'
30216333	2018	"'Pterygium is a fibrovascular subepithelial growth of degenerative tissue over the limbus. It is a common condition worldwide that is especially prevalent in tropical countries within the ""pterygium belt."" Its exact etiology remains to be elucidated; however, it is strongly associated with exposure to ultraviolet light. The high expression levels of tumor protein p53 (TP53) observed in laboratory studies of pterygium seem to contradict the fast-growing nature of its clinical behavior, and TP53 mutations have been suggested. We demonstrated that mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), a TP53-binding protein, contributes to the inhibition of TP53 activity in human pterygium. Thus, disruption of the MDM2-TP53 interaction should attenuate human pterygium cell growth. For primary pterygium, treatment is relatively straightforward and involves surgical excision. To minimize the risk of recurrence, many adjunctive therapies are adopted, including antimetabolites, such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil, amniotic membrane, different variations on conjunctival and/or limbal conjunctival grafts, and other medications such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. In the future, MDM2 antagonists may help further lower the recurrence rates after the treatment of pterygium.'"
30216226	2018	'OBJECTIVE: Zhike-Houpu herbal pair (ZKHPHP) is a well-known Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal motility dysfunction. Recently, many researchers have found that some of the compounds of ZKHPHP such as meranzin hydrate and magnolol have antidepressant effects. However, little is known about the antidepressant mechanism of ZKHPHP. Therefore, the main aim of the study is to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of ZKHPHP and its possible mechanism of action on HTR1A (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A) in the hippocampus CA1 region in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress.\n\nMETHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into six groups: Normal, Model, ZKHPHP(3g/kg), ZKHPHP(10g/kg), ZKHPHP(20g/kg) and ZKHPHP(30g/kg); N=8 per group. We exposed the rats to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and then assessed antidepressant-like effects of ZKHPHP by measuring weight change, observing the open-field test and measuring sucrose water consumption. The antidepressant mechanism was examined by measuring the effect of ZKHPHP on HTR1A protein expression and HTR1A mRNA expression in the hippocampus CA1 region by using immunohistochemistry analysis, western blotting, and Real-time RT-PCR.\n\nRESULTS: ZKHPHP (10 or 20g/kg) reduced the incidence of depressive-like behaviors and increased HTR1A protein and HTR1A mRNA expression in the hippocampus CA1 in rats displaying depressive behavior, while ZKHPHP (3 or 30g/kg) had no obvious effect on the measured depression indicators.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that ZKHPHP has antidepressant-like effects based on a CUMS-induced depression model in rats. ZKHPHP may be attractive as an antidepressant because of its beneficial effects on depression and the absence of gastrointestinal dysregulation, which is a frequently observed unintended effect of many commonly used antidepressive medications.'
30216173	2018	"""OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate possible protective effects of St. John's wort in the hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct were all clamped for 45 minutes to induce ischemia in rats, and after that reperfusion for 1 hour. SJW was administrated orally, once a day for 3 days before ischemia/reperfusion. The aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin levels were measured in the serum samples. Luminol chemiluminescence, lucigenin luminol chemiluminescence levels; myeloperoxidase. The sodium-potassium ATPase (Na+/K+ ATPase) activity was determined in the liver tissue, and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity with the bcl-2/bax ratio were measured by the western blot analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The St. John's wort administration recovered the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-1β levels serum parameters meaningfully, while ischemia/reperfusion caused an increase in luminol chemiluminescence, lucigenin luminol chemiluminescence, myeloperoxidase, caspase-3, and caspase-9 activity and led to a decrease in the B-cell lymphoma-2/bcl-2-associated X protein (bcl-2/bax) ratio and the Na+/K+ ATPase activity.\n\nCONCLUSION: The obtained results indicate protective effects of St. John's wort on the ischemia/reperfusion injury through various mechanisms, and we are able to suggest that St. John's wort can clinically create a new therapeutic principle."""
30216133	2018	'Compared to other protein-rich foods, eggs are of soft texture, easy to cook, and low cost, and may be useful in increasing protein intakes in older adults. Focus groups and interviews were used to explore all reasons for consuming and not consuming eggs in older adults. Forty-two individuals (20 males, 22 females, aged 56-96\u2009years) took part in one of eight focus groups or two individual interviews. Thematic analyses revealed 69 different reasons for eating or not eating eggs in this population. Reasons were related to: hedonics, properties of the food, preparation style, convenience, physical environment, variety, physical health/abilities, nutrition and health knowledge, food safety, social environment, morality, emotion, and habit. Some of these reasons are likely to be specific to egg consumption in older adults, e.g. properties of the food and convenience combined with physical health/abilities. Some reasons are also likely to be more relevant to older than younger individuals, e.g. medical factors. Investigation of the reasons most related to intake on a population-wide scale would aid the development of interventions.'
30216119	2018	'Chemerin and its G protein-coupled receptor (ChemR23) have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the role of chemerin on insulin signalling in the vasculature is still unknown. We aimed to determine whether chemerin reduces vascular insulin signalling and whether there is interplay between chemerin/ChemR23, insulin resistance and vascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Molecular and vascular mechanisms were probed in mesenteric arteries and cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from C57BL/6J, non-diabetic lean db/m and diabetic obese db/db mice as well as in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). Chemerin decreased insulin-induced vasodilatation in C57BL/6J mice, an effect prevented by CCX832 (ChemR23 antagonist) treatment. In VSMC, chemerin, via oxidative stress- and ChemR23-dependent mechanisms, decreased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation to the membrane and glucose uptake. In HMEC, chemerin decreased insulin-activated nitric oxide signalling. AMPK phosphorylation was reduced by chemerin in both HMEC and VSMC. CCX832 treatment of db/db mice decreased body weight, insulin and glucose levels and vascular oxidative stress. CCX832 also partially restored vascular insulin responses in db/db and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Our novel in vivo findings highlight chemerin/ChemR23 as a promising therapeutic target to limit insulin resistance and vascular complications associated with obesity-related diabetes.'
30216110	2018	'Many bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are attributed to an increase in osteoclast number or activity; therefore, control of osteoclasts has significant clinical implications. This study shows how skullcapflavone II (SFII), a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity, regulates osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function. SFII inhibited osteoclastogenesis with decreased activation of MAPKs, Src, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which have been known to be redox sensitive. SFII decreased reactive oxygen species by scavenging them or activating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and its effects were partially reversed by hydrogen peroxide cotreatment or Nrf2 deficiency. In addition, SFII attenuated survival, migration, and bone resorption, with a decrease in the expression of integrin β, Src, and p130 Crk-associated substrate, and the activation of RhoA and Rac1 in differentiated osteoclasts. Furthermore, SFII inhibited osteoclast formation and bone loss in an inflammation- or ovariectomy-induced osteolytic mouse model. These findings suggest that SFII inhibits osteoclastogenesis through redox regulation of MAPKs, Src, and CREB and attenuates the survival and resorption function by modulating the integrin pathway in osteoclasts. SFII has therapeutic potential in the treatment and prevention of bone diseases caused by excessive osteoclast activity.-Lee, J., Son, H. S., Lee, H. I., Lee, G.-R., Jo, Y.-J., Hong, S.-E., Kim, N., Kwon, M., Kim, N. Y., Kim, H. J., Lee, Y. J., Seo, E. K., Jeong, W.

30216109	2018	'In skeletal muscle, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling can either support the complete regeneration of injured muscle or facilitate pathologic fibrosis and muscle degeneration. Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of genetic disorders that results in a progressive decline in muscle function and is characterized by the abundant deposition of fibrotic tissue. Unlike acute injury, where ECM remodeling is acute and transient, in MD, remodeling persists until fibrosis obstructs the regenerative efforts of diseased muscles. Thus, understanding how ECM is deposited and organized is critical in the context of muscle repair. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2) is a matricellular protein expressed by multiple cell types in response to tissue injury. Although used as a general marker of fibrosis, the cell type-dependent role of CTGF in dystrophic muscle has not been elucidated. To address this question, a conditional Ctgf myofiber and fibroblast-knockout mouse lines were generated and crossed to a dystrophic background. Only myofiber-selective inhibition of CTGF protected δ-sarcoglycan-null ( Sgcd) mice from the dystrophic phenotype, and it did so by affecting collagen organization in a way that allowed for improvements in dystrophic muscle regeneration and function. To confirm that muscle-specific CTGF functions to mediate collagen organization, we generated mice with transgenic muscle-specific overexpression of CTGF. Again, genetic modulation of CTGF in muscle was not sufficient to drive fibrosis, but altered collagen content and organization after injury. Our results show that the myofibers are critical mediators of the deleterious effects associated with CTGF in MD and acutely injured skeletal muscle.-Petrosino, J. M., Leask, A., Accornero, F. Genetic manipulation of CCN2/CTGF unveils cell-specific ECM-remodeling effects in injured skeletal muscle.'
30216108	2018	'SCC-S2 overexpression has been implicated in several human cancers, its correlation with prognosis and the mechanism how it reserved biological roles are still uncertain. The current study demonstrated that, in 142 archived colorectal carcinoma (CRC) tissue samples, SCC-S2 expression was significantly correlated with higher histological grade ( p=0.001), tumor invasion ( p=0.001), advanced Dukes staging ( p=0.002), positive regional lymph node metastasis ( p=0.024), and poor overall survival ( p<0.001). MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and Transwell assays showed that SCC-S2 significantly promoted the proliferation and invasion. SCC-S2 expression was also accompanied by the overexpression CyclinD1, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), active-β-catenin, yes-associated protein (YAP), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), as well as the depression of p-large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (p-LATS1) and p-YAP. Moreover, SCC-S2 interacted and colocalized with LATS1, the interaction may interrupt Hippo signaling and thereafter activate canonical Wnt signaling. In conclusion, our data suggested that SCC-S2 was associated with the progression and unfavorable prognosis of CRCs. Meanwhile, SCC-S2 facilitated canonical Wnt signaling and its downstream effectors (CyclinD1, MMP-7) and promoted tumor proliferation and invasion, which depended on the inhibition of Hippo signaling induced by SCC-S2-LATS1 interaction. These results indicated that SCC-S2 might be used as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.'
30216105	2018	'1. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a family of enzymes important for conjugation with glutathione of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Human GSTM1 null allele is associated with toxicity and cancers. Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have molecular and enzymatic similarities of GSTs to humans; however, genetic variants have not been investigated. In macaques, instead of pseudogenized GSTM1, GSTM5 is a predominant GSTM isoform. 2. In this study, resequencing of GSTM5 in 64 cynomolgus and 31 rhesus macaques found 6 non-synonymous variants, and 1 variant (IVS5\u2009+\u20091) causing exon skip. Of these 7 variants, 3 and 1 were found only in Indochinese and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, respectively. 3. Cynomolgus GSTM5-mediated styrene 7,8-oxide and trans-stilbene oxide conjugation activities correlated with GSTM protein levels immunochemically quantified in cynomolgus liver samples. Using recombinant GSTM5 proteins, 4 of the 6 non-synonymous variants including E29Q, L96R, M166V, and S201N showed substantially lower metabolic activities. Moreover, a homozygote for E29Q and heterozygotes for S201N or IVS5\u2009+\u20091 showed significantly lower conjugation activities in liver cytosolic fractions as compared with wild-type animals. 4. Therefore, the present results suggest that inter-animal variability of GST-dependent drug metabolism is at least partly accounted for by GSTM5 variants in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques as preclinical animal models.'
30216081	2018	'BACKGROUND: Resistance to radiotherapy is one of the main obstacles to improving cancer prognosis. To effectively destroy cancer cells, novel radiation sensitizers are needed. Recently, several natural products have been shown to exhibit promising tumor-killing properties. However, little is known about the specific mechanisms of these natural compounds on cancer treatment. In this study, after screening a high-throughput natural product library, we identified tanshinone I (Tan I) as a potential radiation sensitizer in lung cancer cells.\n\nMETHODS: Lung cancer radio-resistant cell lines, H358-IR and H157-IR, were firstly established to confirm the radio-resistant phenotypes. After then, a natural product library was used to screen the potential radiation sensitizer. We further examined the inhibition functions of Tan I on radio-resistant cancer cells via a series of experiments.\n\nRESULTS: Tan I significantly inhibited cell proliferation and clone formation, consequently enhancing radio-sensitivity in radio-resistant lung cancer cells, H358-IR and H157-IR. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) -based quantitative proteomics indicated Tan I down-regulates expression of pro-oncogenic protein phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) in both H358-IR and H157-IR cells. Further analysis of molecular docking showed that Tan I is well-docked into the active pocket of the structure of PPAT, serving as a potential PPAT inhibitor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of the tumor promoter PPAT by Tan I exerts marked inhibitory effects on radio-resistant lung cancer cells, improving radiation efficacy.'
30216071	2018	'The unicellular cyanobacterium Cyanothece ATCC 51142 is capable of oxygenic photosynthesis and biological N2-fixation (BNF), a process highly sensitive to oxygen. Previous work has focused on determining protein expression levels under different growth conditions. A major gap of our knowledge is an understanding how these expressed proteins are assembled into complexes and organized into metabolic pathways, an area that has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we combined size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics to characterize many protein complexes in from Cyanothece 51142 cells grown under 12-h light-dark cycle. We identified 1386 proteins in duplicate biological replicates, and 64% of those proteins were identified as putative complexes. Pair-wise computational prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) identified 74,822 putative interactions, of which 2337 interactions were highly correlated with published protein co-expressions. Many sequential glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes were identified as putative complexes. We also identified many membrane complexes that contain cytoplasmic domains. Subunits of NDH-1 complex eluted in a fraction with an approximate mass of ~669 kDa, and subunits composition revealed co-existence of distinct forms of NDH-1 complex subunits responsible for respiration, electron flow and CO2 uptake. The complex form of the phycocyanin beta subunit was non-phosphorylated and the monomer form was phosphorylated at Ser20, suggesting phosphorylation-dependent de-oligomerization of the phycocyanin beta subunit. This study provides an analytical platform for future studies to reveal how these complexes assemble and disassemble as a function of diurnal and circadian rhythms.'
30216067	2018	'The CHARMM36 carbohydrate parameter set did not adequately reproduce experimental thermodynamic data of carbohydrate interactions with water or proteins or carbohydrate self-association; thus a new nonbonded parameter set for carbohydrates was developed. The parameters were developed to reproduce experimental Kirkwood-Buff integral values, defined by the Kirkwood-Buff theory of solutions, and applied to simulations of glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose. Compared to the CHARMM36 carbohydrate parameters, these new Kirkwood-Buff based parameters reproduced accurately carbohydrate self-association and the trend of activity coefficient derivative changes with concentration. When using these parameters, preferential interaction coefficients calculated from simulations of these carbohydrates and the proteins lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, α-chymotrypsinogen A, and RNase A agreed well with experimental data, while use of the CHARMM36 parameters indicated preferential inclusion of the carbohydrates, in disagreement with experiment. Thus, calculating preferential interaction coefficients from simulations requires using a force field that accurately reproduces trends in the thermodynamic properties of binary excipient-water solutions, and in particular the trend in the activity coefficient derivative. Finally, the carbohydrate-protein simulations using the new parameters indicated that the carbohydrate size was a major factor in the distribution of different carbohydrates around a protein surface.'
30216049	2018	'α-amyrin is a plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, with a lot of important physiological and pharmacological activities. The formation of α-amyrin from (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene is catalyzed by α-amyrin synthase (α-AS), a member of the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) protein family. However, α-amyrin is not yet commercially developed due to its extremely low productivity in plant. The engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae with efficient α-amyrin production pathway could be used as an alternative and sustainable solution to produce α-amyrin from renewable raw materials. To efficiently improve α-amyrin production in S. cerevisiae, we identified two α-ASs, EjAS and MdOSC1 from Eriobotrya japonica and Malus×domestica, respectively, through strict bioinformatics screening criteria and phylogenetic analysis. The specific activities of purified EjAS and MdOSC1 were 0.0032 and 0.0293 μmol/min/mg, respectively. EjAS produced α-amyrin and β-amyrin at a ratio of 17:3, MdOSC1 produced α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol at a ratio of 86:13:1, indicating MdOSC1 had significantly higher specific activity and higher ratio of α-amyrin than EjAS. Furthermore, MdOSC1 was introduced into S. cerevisiae combining with the increased supply of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to achieve the encouraging α-amyrin production, and the titer of α-amyrin achieved 11.97±0.61 mg/L, 5.8 folds of the maximum production reported.'
30216042	2018	'Targeting the protein-protein interaction between p53 and MDM2/MDMX (MDM4) represents an attractive anticancer strategy for the treatment of p53-competent tumors. Several selective and potent MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and entered the clinic, however, the repertoire of MDMX antagonists is still limited. The arylmethylidenepyrazolinone SJ-172550 has been reported as a selective MDMX antagonist, yet uncertainties about its mechanism of action have raised doubts about its use as a chemical probe. Here, we show that, in addition to its unclear mode of action, SJ-172550 is unstable in aqueous buffers giving rise to side products of unknown biological activity. Using an SJ-172550-derived affinity probe we observed promiscuous binding to cellular proteins whereas cellular thermal shift assays did not reveal a stabilizing effect on MDMX. Overall, our results raise further questions about the interpretation of data using SJ-172550 and related compounds to investigate cellular phenotypes.'
30216041	2018	'Improvements in genetic code expansion have made preparing proteins with diverse functional groups almost routine. Nonetheless, unnatural amino acids (Uaas) pose theoretical burdens on protein solubility, and determinants of position-specific tolerability to Uaas remain underexplored. To broadly examine associations, we systematically assessed the effect of substituting the fluorescent Uaa, acridonylalanine, at more than fifty chemically, evolutionarily, and structurally diverse residues in two bacterial proteins-LexA and RecA. Surprisingly, properties that ostensibly contribute to Uaa tolerability-like conservation, hydrophobicity, or accessibility-demonstrated no consistent correlations with resulting protein solubility. Instead, solubility closely depended on the location of the substitution within the overall tertiary structure, suggesting that intrinsic properties of protein domains, and not individual positions, are stronger determinants of Uaa tolerability. Consequently, those who seek to install Uaas in new target proteins should consider broadening, rather than narrowing, the types of residues screened for Uaa incorporation.'
30216039	2018	"'The West African iboga plant has been used for centuries by the Bwiti and Mbiri tribes to induce hallucinations during religious ceremonies. Ibogaine, the principal alkaloid responsible for iboga\'s psychedelic properties, was isolated and sold as an antidepressant in France for decades before its adverse effects precipitated its removal from the market. An ibogaine resurgence in the 1960s was driven by U.S. heroin addicts who claimed that ibogaine cured their opiate addictions. Behavioral pharmacologic studies in animal models provided evidence that ibogaine could blunt self-administration of not only opiates but cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine. Ibogaine displays moderate-to-weak affinities for a wide spectrum of receptor and transporter proteins; recent work suggests that its actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may underlie its reputed anti-opiate effects. At micromolar levels, ibogaine is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic, and has been linked to several deaths by cardiac arrest. Structure-activity studies led to the isolation of the ibogaine analog 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a α3β4 nicotinic receptor modulator that retains ibogaine\'s anti-craving properties with few or no adverse effects. Clinical trials of 18-MC treatment of nicotine addiction are pending. Ibogaine analogs may also hold promise for treating anxiety and depression via the ""psychedelic-assisted therapy"" approach that employs hallucinogens including psilocybin and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""ecstasy"").'"
30216016	2018	"""Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children is defined as at least three episodes of pain that occur over at least three months and affect the child's ability to perform normal activities. RAP is most often considered functional (nonorganic) abdominal pain, but an organic cause is found in 5% to 10% of cases. Further workup is warranted in children who have RAP and fever, vomiting, blood in the stool, more than three alarm symptoms, or a history of urinary tract infections. Physical examination findings that should prompt further workup include weight loss or failure to grow; jaundice; costovertebral tenderness or back pain with lower extremity neurologic symptoms; liver, spleen, or kidney enlargement; an abdominal mass; or localized tenderness on abdominal examination. Workup may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, fecal guaiac testing, fecal ova and parasite testing, or urinalysis. Pregnancy testing and screening for sexually transmitted infections should be considered in adolescents or if there are concerns about sexual abuse. Abdominal radiography can be helpful for diagnosing obstruction or constipation. Abdominal ultrasonography identifies an abnormality in up to 10% of children with RAP who meet criteria for further workup, compared with 1% of those who do not meet these criteria. Functional abdominal pain is a clinical diagnosis and no workup is needed. Management of functional abdominal pain focuses on improving quality of life, reducing parent and child concerns about the seriousness of the condition, and reducing the disability associated with pain rather than complete resolution of pain. Although evidence is lacking for most pharmacologic treatments of functional abdominal pain, psychological therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy and hypnotherapy have been shown to be beneficial."""
30215978	2018	"'The establishment of eating practices that contribute to lifelong nutritional habits and overall health begins in toddlerhood. During this time, children acquire the motor skills needed to feed themselves and develop preferences that affect their food selections. Classifications for faltering weight (also called failure to thrive or growth faltering) and overweight are based on World Health Organization child growth standards (for children younger than two years) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts (for children two years and older). Breast milk or whole cow\'s milk should be offered as the primary beverage between one and two years of age. Sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided in all toddlers, and water or milk should be offered instead. Allergenic foods such as peanuts should be introduced early to infants at higher risk of allergies. Vitamin D and iron supplementation may be advisable in certain circumstances, but multivitamins and other micronutrient supplements are usually unnecessary in healthy children who have a balanced diet and normal growth. Optimal food choices for toddlers are fresh foods and minimally processed foods with little or no added sugar, salt, or fat (e.g., fruits, vegetables, lean protein, seeds, whole grains). Parents and caregivers are responsible for modeling healthy food choices and dietary practices, which shape children\'s food preferences and eating behaviors. Parents should avoid practices that lead to overeating in toddlers (e.g., feeding to soothe or to get children to sleep, providing excessive portions, pushing children to ""clean their plates,"" punishing with food, force-feeding, allowing frequent snacks or grazing). In general, parents should use the approach of ""the parent provides, the child decides,"" in which the parent provides healthy food options, and the child chooses which foods to eat and how much.'"
30215930	2018	'Diet is the single most significant risk factor for disability and premature death. Patients and physicians often have difficulty staying abreast of diet trends, many of which focus primarily on weight loss rather than nutrition and health. Recommending an eating style can help patients make positive change. Dietary patterns that support health include the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Healthy Eating Plate. These approaches have benefits that include prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These dietary patterns are supported by strong evidence that promotes a primary focus on unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. Added sugars should be limited to less than 5% to 10% of daily caloric intake. Vegetables (not including potatoes) and fruits should make up one-half of each meal. Carbohydrate sources should primarily include beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. An emphasis on monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocados, and nuts, and omega-3 fatty acids, such as flax, cold-water fish, and nuts, helps prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline. A focus on foods rather than macronutrients can assist patients in understanding a healthy diet. Addressing barriers to following a healthy diet and utilizing the entire health care team can assist patients in following these guidelines.'

Dysfunction of this dynein-dynactin complex causes several neurodegenerative diseases such as Perry syndrome, motor neuron diseases and progressive supranuclear palsy. Recently, we reported colocalization of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-SNCA) and the largest subunit of dynactin (DCTN1) in Lewy body (LB)-like structures in Perry syndrome. Previous reports have not focused on the relationship between dynactin and synucleinopathies. Thus, we examined autopsied human brains from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with LBs, and multiple system atrophy using immunohistochemistry for p-SNCA, DCTN1, dynactin 2 (DCTN2, dynamitin) and dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1I1). We also examined microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs), which phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption. Both brainstem-type and cortical LBs were immunopositive for DCTN1, DCTN2, DYNC1I1 and p-MARK and their staining often overlapped with p-SNCA. Lewy neurites were also immunopositive for DCTN1, DCTN2 and DYNC1I1. However, p-SNCA-positive inclusions of multiple system atrophy, which included both glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, were immunonegative for DCTN1, DCTN2, DYNC1I1 and p-MARK. Thus, immunohistochemistry for dynein-dynactin complex molecules, especially DCTN1, can clearly distinguish LBs from neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Our results suggest that dynactin is closely associated with LB pathology."""

The vitamins are mandatory for the function of numerous enzymes and lack of one or more of the vitamins may lead to severe medical conditions. All the vitamins are supplied by food in microgram to milligram quantities and in addition some of the vitamins are synthesized by the intestinal microbiota. In the gastrointestinal tract, the vitamins are liberated from binding proteins and for some of the vitamins modified prior to absorption. Due to their solubility in water, they all require specific carriers to be absorbed. Our current knowledge concerning each of the vitamins differs in depth and focus and is influenced by the prevalence of conditions and diseases related to lack of the individual vitamin. Because of that we have chosen to cover slightly different aspects for the individual vitamins. For each of the vitamins, we summarize the physiological role, the steps involved in the absorption, and the factors influencing the absorption.

30215859	2018	'The colon has large capacities for K absorption and K secretion, but its role in maintaining K homeostasis is often overlooked. For many years, passive diffusion and/or solvent drag were thought to be the primary mechanisms for K absorption in human and animal colon. However, it is now clear that apical H ,K -ATPase, in coordination with basolateral K -Cl cotransport and/or K and Cl channels operating in parallel, mediate electroneutral K absorption in animal colon. We now know that K absorption in rat colon reflects ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive apical H ,K -ATPase activities. Ouabain-insensitive and ouabain-sensitive H ,K -ATPases are localized in surface and crypt cells, respectively. Colonic H ,K -ATPase consists of α- (HKC ) and β- (HKC ) subunits which, when coexpressed, exhibit ouabain-insensitive H ,K -ATPase activity in HEK293 cells, while HKC coexpressed with the gastric β-subunit exhibits ouabain-sensitive H ,K -ATPase activity in Xenopus oocytes. Aldosterone enhances apical H ,K -ATPase activity, HKC specific mRNA and protein expression, and K absorption. Active K secretion, on the other hand, is mediated by apical K channels operating in a coordinated way with the basolateral Na -K -2Cl cotransporter. Both Ca -activated intermediate conductance K (IK) and large conductance K (BK) channels are located in the apical membrane of colonic epithelia. IK channel-mediated K efflux provides the driving force for Cl secretion, while BK channels mediate active (e.g., cAMP-activated) K secretion. BK channel expression and activity are increased in patients with end-stage renal disease and ulcerative colitis. This review summarizes the role of apical H ,K -ATPase in K absorption, and apical BK channel function in K secretion in health and disease. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

30215858	2018	'ATP sensitive potassium channels (K ) are so named because they open as cellular ATP levels fall. This leads to membrane hyperpolarization and thus links cellular metabolism to membrane excitability. They also respond to MgADP and are regulated by a number of cell signaling pathways. They have a rich and diverse pharmacology with a number of agents acting as specific inhibitors and activators. K channels are formed of pore-forming subunits, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, and a large auxiliary subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B). The Kir6.0 subunits are a member of the inwardly rectifying family of potassium channels and the sulfonylurea receptor is part of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins. Four SURs and four Kir6.x form an octameric channel complex and the association of a particular SUR with a specific Kir6.x subunit constitutes the K current in a particular tissue. A combination of mutagenesis work combined with structural studies has identified how these channels work as molecular machines. They have a variety of physiological roles including controlling the release of insulin from pancreatic β cells and regulating blood vessel tone and blood pressure. Furthermore, mutations in the genes underlie human diseases such as congenital diabetes and hyperinsulinism. Additionally, opening of these channels is protective in a number of pathological conditions such as myocardial ischemia and stroke. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

30215857	2018	'The immune response to acute muscle damage is important for normal repair. However, in chronic diseases such as many muscular dystrophies, the immune response can amplify pathology and play a major role in determining disease severity. Muscular dystrophies are inheritable diseases that vary tremendously in severity, but share the progressive loss of muscle mass and function that can be debilitating and lethal. Mutations in diverse genes cause muscular dystrophy, including genes that encode proteins that maintain membrane strength, participate in membrane repair, or are components of the extracellular matrix or the nuclear envelope. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that an important feature of many muscular dystrophies is an immune response adapted to acute, infrequent muscle damage that is misapplied in the context of chronic injury. We discuss the involvement of the immune system in the most common muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and show that the immune system influences muscle death and fibrosis as disease progresses. We then present information on immune cell function in other muscular dystrophies and show that for many muscular dystrophies, release of cytosolic proteins into the extracellular space may provide an initial signal, leading to an immune response that is typically dominated by macrophages, neutrophils, helper T-lymphocytes, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Although those features are similar in many muscular dystrophies, each muscular dystrophy shows distinguishing features in the magnitude and type of inflammatory response. These differences indicate that there are disease-specific immunomodulatory molecules that determine response to muscle cell damage caused by diverse genetic mutations. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

The outstanding efficacy, prolonged durability of effect, and rapid assimilation of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in clinical practice have been nothing short of a medical breakthrough in the treatment of numerous malignancies. The major advantages of these therapeutic antibodies over their small molecule counterparts have been their high binding affinity and target specificity. However, antibodies do have their flaws including immune-related toxicities, inadequate pharmacokinetics and tumor penetration, and high cost burden to manufacturers and consumers. These limitations hinder broader clinical applications of the antibodies and have heightened interests in developing the alternative small molecule platform that includes peptidomimetics and peptides to target the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system. The progress on these small molecule alternatives has been relatively slow compared to that of the antibodies. Fortunately, recent structural studies of the interactions among PD-1, PD-L1, and their respective antibodies have revealed key hotspots on PD-1 and PD-L1 that may facilitate drug discovery efforts for small molecule immunotherapeutics. This review is intended to discuss key concepts in immuno-oncology, describe the successes and shortcomings of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-based therapies, and to highlight the recent development of small molecule inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interaction.'
30215796	2018	'Introduction: Optimal diet together with good physical fitness maintains readiness and military performance during longer deployments. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in dietary macronutrient and energy intake, total physical activity and body composition during a 6-month deployment in South Lebanon. Furthermore, associations of diet macronutrient intake and physical activity on body composition were also studied.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Forty male soldiers kept a 3-day food diary and their body composition was measured via bioimpedance and ultrasonography. Total physical activity was evaluated by accelerometers in a subgroup of participants. Measurements were conducted in the PRE-, MID-, and POST-deployment.\n\nResults: Mean carbohydrate intakes were 39.5-42.6 E%, protein intakes 18.7-22.3 E%, and fat intakes 34.9-35.7 E%. Daily energy intake remained stable (10.1-10.3 MJ/D). Total physical activity was decreased during deployment (e.g., step count from 9,835 ± 2,743 to 8,388 ± 2,875 steps/day, p = 0.007). Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased by 1.3% (p = 0.019) and 1.9% (p = 0.006), respectively. Energy and fat intake associated positively with body mass and skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.31-0.48, p < 0.05-0.001).\n\nConclusions: Carbohydrate intakes and physical activity were low, compared with the general recommendations. Protein intakes were relatively high. Skeletal muscle mass and subcutaneous fat increased. Suboptimal diet together with low level of physical activity may have a negative impact on body composition, physical performance, and cardiometabolic health. Consequently, soldiers should be encouraged to consume more fiber-rich carbohydrates and less saturated fatty acids as well as maintain a high level of physical fitness to sustain military readiness during long-term deployments.'
30215795	2018	"""The tumour suppressor p53, encoded by TP53, is a key player in a wide network of signalling pathways. We investigated its role in the bioactivation of the environmental carcinogen 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA)found in diesel exhaust and its metabolites 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA) and N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-3-ABA) in a panel of isogenic human colorectal HCT116 cells differing only with respect to their TP53 status [i.e. TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-), TP53(-/-), TP53(R248W/+) or TP53(R248W/-)]. As a measure of metabolic competence, DNA adduct formation was determined using 32P-postlabelling. Wild-type (WT) p53 did not affect the bioactivation of 3-NBA; no difference in DNA adduct formation was observed in TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells. Bioactivation of both metabolites 3-ABA and N-OH-3-ABA on the other hand was WT-TP53 dependent. Lower 3-ABA- and N-OH-3-ABA-DNA adduct levels were found in TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells compared to TP53(+/+) cells, and p53's impact was attributed to differences in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 expression for 3-ABA whereas for N-OH-3-ABA, an impact of this tumour suppressor on sulphotransferase (SULT) 1A1/3 expression was detected. Mutant R248W-p53 protein function was similar to or exceeded the ability of WT-p53 in activating 3-NBA and its metabolites, measured as DNA adducts. However, identification of the xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme(s) (XMEs), through which mutant-p53 regulates these responses, proved difficult to decipher. For example, although both mutant cell lines exhibited higher CYP1A1 induction after 3-NBA treatment compared to TP53(+/+) cells, 3-NBA-derived DNA adduct levels were only higher in TP53(R248W/-) cells but not in TP53(R248W/+) cells. Our results show that p53's influence on carcinogen activation depends on the agent studied and thereby on the XMEs that mediate the bioactivation of that particular compound. The phenomenon of p53 regulating CYP1A1 expression in human cells is consistent with other recent findings; however, this is the first study highlighting the impact of p53 on sulphotransferase-mediated (i.e. SULT1A1) carcinogen metabolism in human cells."""

Fatty-acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was previously found to be associated with clinical renal dysfunction and was proposed as a biomarker of glomerular damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate FABP4 as a potential preclinical biomarker of drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI). Han - Wistar rats were dosed with cisplatin (2.5mg/kg, single, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), puromycin (10mg/kg, daily, i.p.) or N-phenylanthranylic acid (NPAA, 500mg/kg, daily, per os (p.o.)) over a 28-day period to induce proximal tubule, glomerular or collecting duct injury, respectively. An increase in urinary FABP4 levels was observed on days 1 and 3 after NPAA treatment and on days 14, 21 and 28 after puromycin treatment, whereas cisplatin treatment had no effect. No significant changes were reported for plasma levels of FABP4 after any treatment. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis showed a marked decrease in FABP4 expression in the loop of Henle on day 7 after NPAA treatment and a complete loss of FABP4 expression on day 14 after puromycin treatment. The magnitude of increase in FABP4 urinary levels in response to NPAA and puromycin was higher than for established preclinical biomarkers serum creatinine, clusterin or cystatin C. Our results suggest that FABP4 has the potential for preclinical application as a biomarker of DIKI.'
30215789	2018	'The discovery of mammalian cardiac progenitor cells has suggested that the heart consists of not only terminally differentiated beating cardiomyocytes, but also a population of self-renewing stem cells with the potential to generate new cardiomyocytes (Anderson, Self et al. 2007; Bearzi, Rota et al. 2007; Wu, Chien et al. 2008). A consequence of longevity is continual exposure to environmental and xenobiotic stresses, and recent literature suggests that hematopoietic stem cell pools tightly control cell health through upregulation of the integrated stress response and consequent cellular mechanisms such as apoptosis. However, whether or not this biological response is conserved in progenitor cells for later lineages of tissue specific stem cells is not well understood. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of both cardiac progenitor and mature cardiomyocyte lineages, we found that the integrated stress response was upregulated in the iPSC cardiac progenitors leading to an increased sensitivity for apoptosis relative to the mature cardiomyocytes. Of interest, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) signaling plays a mechanistic role in the cell death phenotype observed in iPSC progenitors, by which depletion of CHOP prevents cell death following cellular stress by thapsigargin exposure. Our studies suggest that the integrated stress response plays a unique role in maintaining iPSC cardiac progenitor cellular integrity by removing unhealthy cells via apoptosis following environmental and xenobiotic stresses, thus preventing differentiation and self-renewal of damaged cells.'
30215777	2018	'Transcription factor Nrf2 protects hepatocytes against various toxicants by upregulating cytoprotective genes. The heme synthesis inhibitor 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) leads to liver injury around the portal vein, unlike other groups of toxicants that cause hemorrhage and necrosis in the centrilobular area. To examine whether and how Nrf2 protects livers from the injury, we fed DDC to Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2KO), wild-type (WT), Keap1flox/flox (Keap1-knockdown; Keap1KD), and liver-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1-Alb) mice, as these lines of mice exhibit stepwise increases in Nrf2 protein expression levels. Liver-specific Keap1::Nrf2 double-knockout (Keap1::Nrf2-Alb) mice were also exploited to examine the contribution of Nrf2. Two weeks after DDC-feeding, Keap1-Alb mice were fully recovered from body-weight-loss, but the WT and Nrf2KO mice were not. The liver-to-body-weight ratio of Keap1-Alb mice was significantly larger than that of WT and Nrf2KO mice. Two indicators of hepatotoxicity, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin in plasma, were both elevated in WT mice, but downregulated in Keap1-Alb mice after the DDC-feeding. DDC-induced porphyrin accumulation was reduced in the livers of Keap1-Alb and Keap1KD mice compared with that of WT mice. When assessed by the Nqo1 level, Nrf2 expression was further enhanced by DDC in Keap1-Alb mice, suggesting that DDC may have a Keap1-independent potential to activate Nrf2. Genetic activation of Nrf2 in Keap1-Alb mice increased the extracellular excretion of porphyrins, but contrary to our expectation, hepatic damages in Nrf2KO mice appeared to be similar to that of WT mice. Based on these observations, we conclude that Nrf2 activation protects livers against DDC-elicited hepatotoxicity.'
30215764	2018	'Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation et\xa0al, are very important biological processes. PTM changes in some critical genes, which may be induced by base-pair substitution, are shown to affect the risk of diseases. Recently, large-scale exome-wide association studies found that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play an important role in the susceptibility for complex diseases or traits. One of the functional mechanisms of missense SNPs is that they may affect PTMs and leads to a protein dysfunction and its downstream signaling pathway disorder. Here, we constructed a database named AWESOME (A Website Exhibits SNP On Modification Event, http://www.awesome-hust.com), which is an interactive web-based analysis tool that systematically evaluates the role of SNPs on nearly all kinds of PTMs based on 20 available tools. We also provided a well-designed scoring system to compare the performance of different PTM prediction tools and help users to get a better interpretation of results. Users can search SNPs, genes or position of interest, filter with specific modifications or prediction methods, to get a comprehensive PTM change induced by SNPs. In summary, our database provides a convenient way to detect PTM-related SNPs, which may potentially be pathogenic factors or therapeutic targets.'
30215760	2018	'Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes evolved from bacterial ribosomes by reduction of ribosomal RNAs, increase of ribosomal protein content, and loss of guanine nucleotides. Guanine is the base most sensitive to oxidative damage. By systematically comparing high-quality, small ribosomal subunit RNA sequence alignments and solved 3D ribosome structures from mammalian mitochondria and bacteria, we deduce rules for folding a complex RNA with the remaining guanines shielded from solvent. Almost all conserved guanines in both bacterial and mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal RNA form guanine-specific, local or long-range, RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. Many solvent-exposed guanines conserved in bacteria are replaced in mammalian mitochondria by bases less sensitive to oxidation. New guanines, conserved only in the mitochondrial alignment, are strategically positioned at solvent inaccessible sites to stabilize the ribosomal RNA structure. New mitochondrial proteins substitute for truncated RNA helices, maintain mutual spatial orientations of helices, compensate for lost RNA-RNA interactions, reduce solvent accessibility of bases, and replace guanines conserved in bacteria by forming specific amino acid-RNA interactions.'

Despite displaying similar stomatal conductance and internal CO2 concentration, we observed reduced photosynthesis and growth in the dapat mutant. Surprisingly, whilst no differences in dark respiration were observed between genotypes, a lower storage and consumption of starch and sugars was observed in dapat plants. Additionally, higher protein turnover but no differences in total amino acids were observed during a diurnal cycle in dapat plants. Transcriptional and two-dimensional (IEF/SDS-PAGE) proteome analyses demonstrated alterations in the abundance of several transcripts and proteins associated with photosynthesis and photorespiration coupled with a high glycine/serine ratio and increased levels of stress-responsive amino acids. Our findings demonstrate that biochemical alterations rather than stomatal limitations were responsible for the decreased photosynthesis and growth of the dapat mutants; which we hypothesize mimic stress conditions associated with impairments in Lys biosynthesis pathway.'

The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper protein (HBZ) is expressed in all cases of ATL and is directly associated with virus pathogenicity. The two isoforms of the HBZ protein are synthesized from antisense messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are either spliced (sHBZ) or unspliced (usHBZ) versions of the HBZ transcript. The sHBZ and usHBZ mRNAs have entirely different 5'untranslated regions (5'UTR) and are differentially expressed in cells, with the sHBZ protein being more abundant. Here, we show that differential expression of the HBZ isoforms is regulated at the translational level. Translation initiation of the usHBZ mRNA relies on a cap-dependent mechanism, while the sHBZ mRNA uses internal initiation. Based on the structural data for the sHBZ 5'UTR generated by SHAPE in combination with 5' and 3' deletion mutants, the minimal region harboring IRES activity was mapped to the 5'end of the sHBZ mRNA. In addition, the sHBZ IRES recruited the 40S ribosomal subunit upstream of the initiation codon, and IRES activity was found to be dependent on the ribosomal protein eS25 and eIF5A."""

A 27-year-old male patient with a positive medical history for ankylosing spondylitis presented with one month of proximal upper limb muscle weakness associated with pain on both acromioclavicular joints. A biopsy of deltoid muscle documented the disappearance of M-line, the misalignment of myofilaments, and the loss of the distinction between the A and I bands. Complete resolution of muscle weakness occurred after one year of treatment with antiTNFα agent Etanercept. Because of the acute onset of symptoms and the recovery after immunosuppressive treatment we hypothesized that an immune-mediated mechanism was responsible for the muscle disorder. The serum IgG-mediated autoreactivity to skeletal muscle antigens resolved by bidimensional electrophoresis was assessed in the described patient and compared with that of control subjects. The comparative analysis of the immunoreactive spots revealed that ATP synthase subunit α is specifically recognized by patient's serum, suggesting that the protein might represent a putative antigenic target in the disease.

30215740	2018	'Polycystin-1 (PC1), encoded by the PKD1 gene that is mutated in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney disease, regulates a number of processes including bone development. Activity of the transcription factor RunX2, which controls osteoblast differentiation, is reduced in Pkd1 mutant mice but the mechanism governing PC1 activation of RunX2 is unclear. PC1 undergoes regulated cleavage that releases its C-terminal tail, which translocates to the nucleus to modulate transcriptional pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis. We find that the cleaved carboxy-terminal tail of PC1 (PC1-CTT) stimulates the transcriptional co-activator TAZ (Wwtr1), an essential co-activator of RunX2. PC1-CTT physically interacts with TAZ, stimulating RunX2 transcriptional activity in pre-osteoblast cells in a TAZ-dependent manner. The PC1-CTT increases the interaction between TAZ and RunX2 and enhances the recruitment of the p300 transcriptional co-regulatory protein to the TAZ/RunX2/PC1-CTT complex. Zebrafish injected with morpholinos directed against pkd1 manifest severe bone calcification defects and a curly tail phenotype. Injection of mRNA encoding the PC1-CTT into pkd1-morphant fish restores bone mineralization and reduces the severity of the curly tail phenotype. These effects are abolished by co-injection of morpholinos directed against TAZ. Injection of mRNA encoding a dominant-active TAZ construct is sufficient to rescue both the curly tail phenotype and the skeletal defects observed in pkd1-morpholino treated fish. Thus, TAZ constitutes a key mechanistic link through which PC1 mediates its physiological functions.'
30215729	2018	'Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main source of energy for postweaning ruminants. The monocarboxylic acid transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, are thought to contribute to the absorption of SCFAs from the surface of the rumen following weaning. The present study measured changes in MCT1 and MCT4 expression in ruminal epithelial cells isolated from male preweaning (22 to 34 d old, n = 6) and postweaning (55 to 58 d old, n = 8) calves after euthanasia and sought to examine whether SCFAs stimulate the expression of these transporters. In the current study, cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) gene expression in the rumen was also investigated since CD147 has been considered to act as ancillary protein for MCT1 and MCT4 to express their correct function. The gene expression levels of MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 in the rumen were found to be significantly higher in postweaning calves than in preweaning calves. Strong MCT1 immunoreactivity was detected in both the stratum basale (SB) and the stratum spinosum (SS) in postweaning ruminal epithelium. Expression of MCT1 in preweaning calves was localized to a specific region of the SB and of the SS. MCT4-immunopositive cells were detected in the stratum corneum (SC) of the ruminal epithelium in postweaning calves. However, only a low level of signal was detected in the SC of preweaning animals. Furthermore, in vitro experiments, ruminal epithelial cells were incubated for 24 h with acetate (0.04, 0.4, and 4 mM), propionate (0.2, 2, and 20 mM), butyrate (0.1, 1, and 10 mM), or β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA; 0.1, 1, and 10 mM), respectively. Both propionate and butyrate induced an increase in the gene expression levels of MCT4 and CD147, but did not affect MCT1 gene expression. There are no significant effects of acetate and BHBA treatment on these gene expressions. Taken together, these results suggest that an increase in MCT4 and CD147 gene expression in the ruminal epithelium of postweaning calves is likely to be due to the effects of propionate and butyrate derived from a solid-based diet, which may contribute to ruminal development following weaning.'
30215728	2018	'Paired amphipathic helix protein (SIN3B) is a transcription corepressor for many genes. Here we show a different regulation mechanism of integrin αV gene expression by SIN3B in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We first observed a close relationship between Integrin αV and SIN3B expressions in HCC patients and tumor cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Overexpression of SIN3B significantly accelerated the cell migration rate of SMMC-7721, but failed when integrin αV expression was silenced. Interestingly, SIN3B stimulated integrin αV subunit promoter activity only in the presence of sulfatide. Importantly, SIN3B was identified in the complex with sulfatide by mass spectrometry. Fat blot assay indicated that SIN3B specifically interacted with sulfatide. Molecular modeling suggested that sulfatide induced the conformational change of SIN3B from compacted α-helices to a relaxed β-sheet in PAH2 domain. The data of immunoprecipitation and ChIP assay indicated that altered SIN3B lost the binding affinity with MAD1 and HDAC2, which reduced the recruitment of HDAC2 on integrin αV gene promoter and prevented the deacetylation of the histone 3. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SIN3B promoted the transcriptional activation of the integrin αV subunit gene promoter by reducing interaction with HDAC2.'
30215718	2018	"""Background: Alterations in the gut microbiota are strongly associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly with Crohn's disease, which is characterized by reduced abundance of commensal anaerobic bacteria including members of the Bacteroides genus. Our aim was to investigate the protective effects of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an abundant member of this genus, in different rodent models of IBD.\n\nMethods: We assessed the effect of B. thetaiotaomicron administration on primary readouts of colitis (weight loss, histopathology, and immune parameters) in dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) and interleukin-10 knockout (IL10KO) models of IBD. Efficacy of a freeze-dried bacterial formulation and a purified recombinant protein of B. thetaiotaomicron was also investigated.\n\nResults: B. thetaiotaomicron showed protective effects in both DSS and IL10KO rodent models, as demonstrated by significant amelioration of weight loss, colon shortening, histopathological damage and immune activation. This efficacy was not exclusive to actively growing bacterial preparations but was retained by freeze-dried cells of B. thetaiotaomicron. A pirin-like protein (PLP) of B. thetaiotaomicron, identified by microarray analysis during coculture of the bacterial strain with Caco-2 cells, reduced pro-inflammatory NF-κB signalling in these intestinal epithelial cells. Recombinant PLP partially recapitulated the effect of the whole strain in a rat DSS model.\n\nConclusions: B. thetaiotaomicron displays strong efficacy in preclinical models of IBD and protects against weight loss, histopathological changes in the colon and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that the live strain or its products may be a novel alternative to current treatment options for Crohn's disease."""
30215711	2018	'OBJECTIVE: Congenital myopathies are typically characterised by early onset hypotonia, weakness and hallmark features on biopsy. Despite the rapid pace of gene discovery, approximately 50% of patients with a congenital myopathy remain without a genetic diagnosis following screening of known disease genes.\n\nMETHODS: We performed exome sequencing on two consanguineous probands diagnosed with a congenital myopathy and muscle biopsy showing selective atrophy/hypotrophy or absence of type II myofibres.\n\nRESULTS: We identified variants in the gene (MYL1) encoding the skeletal muscle fast-twitch specific myosin essential light chain in both probands. A homozygous essential splice acceptor variant (c.479-2A>G, predicted to result in skipping of exon 5 was identified in Proband 1, and a homozygous missense substitution (c.488T>G, p.(Met163Arg)) was identified in Proband 2. Protein modeling of the p.(Met163Arg) substitution predicted it might impede intermolecular interactions that facilitate binding to the IQ domain of myosin heavy chain, thus likely impacting on the structure and functioning of the myosin motor. MYL1 was markedly reduced in skeletal muscle from both probands, suggesting that the missense substitution likely results in an unstable protein. Knock down of myl1 in zebrafish resulted in abnormal morphology, disrupted muscle structure and impaired touch-evoked escape responses, thus confirming that skeletal muscle fast-twitch specific myosin essential light chain is critical for myofibre development and function.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Our data implicate MYL1 as a crucial protein for adequate skeletal muscle function and that MYL1 deficiency is associated with a severe congenital myopathy.'
