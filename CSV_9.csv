0	12194857	'The sorting of transmembrane proteins (e.g., cell surface receptors) into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway to the lysosomal/vacuolar lumen requires the function of the ESCRT protein complexes. The soluble coiled-coil-containing proteins Abc, Bmw, Xyz and  are recruited from the cytoplasm to endosomal membranes where they oligomerize into a protein complex, ESCRT-III. ESCRT-III contains two functionally distinct subcomplexes. The Vps20-Snf7 subcomplex binds to the endosomal membrane, in part via the myristoyl group of Vps20. The Vps2-Vps24 subcomplex binds to the Vps20-Snf7 complex and thereby serves to recruit additional cofactors to this site of protein sorting. We provide evidence for a role for ESCRT-III in sorting and/or concentration of MVB cargoes.'
1	28835279	"""BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulates in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the onset of AD pathogenesis. Uml,Alterations in endosomes are among the earliest changes associated with AD but the mechanism(s) that cause endosome enlargement and the effects of MVB dysfunction on Aβ accumulation and tau pathology are incompletely understood.\n\nMETHODS: MVB size and Aβ fibrils in primary neurons were visualized by electron microscopy and confocal fluorescent microscopy. MVB-dysfunction, modelled by expression of dominant negative VPS4A (dnVPS4A), was analysed by biochemical methods and exosome isolation.\n\nRESULTS: Here we show that AD transgenic neurons have enlarged MVBs compared to wild type neurons. Uptake of exogenous Aβ also leads to enlarged MVBs in wild type neurons and generates fibril-like structures in endocytic vesicles. With time fibrillar oligomers/fibrils can extend out of the endocytic vesicles and are eventually detectable extracellularly. Further, endosomal sorting complexes,Pqr required for transport (ESCRT) components were found associated with amyloid plaques in AD transgenic mice,Mnp The phenotypes previously reported in AD transgenic neurons, with net increased intracellular levels and reduced secretion of Aβ, were mimicked by blocking recycling of ESCRT-III by dnVPS4A. DnVPS4A further resembled AD pathology by increasing tau phosphorylation at serine 396 and increasing markers of autophagy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Aβ leads to MVB enlargement and that amyloid fibres can form within the endocytic pathway of neurons. These results are consistent with the scenario of the endosome-lysosome system representing the site of initiation of Aβ aggregation. In turn, a dominant negative form of the CHMP2B-interacting protein VPS4A, which alters MVBs, leads to accumulation and aggregation of Aβ as well as tau phosphorylation, mimicking the cellular changes in AD."""
2	17683935	'Defects Xyz in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. A key step in the endocytic regulation of transmembrane proteins occurs in a subset of late-endosomal compartments known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whose formation is controlled by endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). The roles of ESCRT in dendritic maintenance and neurodegeneration remain unknown. Here, we show that mSnf7-2, a key component of ESCRT-III, is highly expressed in most mammalian neurons. Loss of mSnf7-2 in mature cortical neurons caused retraction of,Lmn dendrites and neuronal cell loss. mSnf7-2 binds to CHMP2B, another ESCRT-III subunit, in which a rare dominant mutation is associated with frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). Ectopic expression of the mutant protein CHMP2B(Intron5) also caused dendritic retraction prior to neurodegeneration. CHMP2B(Intron5) was associated more avidly than CHMP2B(WT) with mSnf7-2, resulting in sequestration of mSnf7-2 in ubiquitin-positive late-endosomal vesicles in cortical neurons. Moreover, loss of mSnf7-2 or CHMP2B(Intron5) expression caused the accumulation of autophagosomes in cortical neurons and flies. These findings indicate that ESCRT-III dysfunction is associated with the autophagy pathway, suggesting a novel neurodegeneration mechanism that may have important implications for understanding FTD and other age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases.'
3	17984323	"""The Abc endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) are Lmn required to sort integral membrane proteins Nxg into intralumenal vesicles of the multivesicular Lmn body (MVB). Mutations in the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP2B were recently associated with frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal ubiquitin-positive protein deposits in affected neurons. We show here that autophagic degradation is inhibited in cells depleted of ESCRT subunits and in cells expressing CHMP2B mutants, leading to accumulation of protein aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins, p62 and Alfy. Moreover, we find that functional MVBs are required for clearance of TDP-43 (identified as the major ubiquitinated protein in ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin deposits), and of expanded polyglutamine aggregates associated with Huntington's disease. Together, our data indicate that efficient autophagic degradation requires functional MVBs and provide a possible explanation to the observed neurodegenerative phenotype seen in patients with CHMP2B mutations."""
4	25791428	"""Abnormally Rtr hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates form paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary, Bt5.1 tangles, a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) Akm and other tauopathies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble total tau and phospho-tau from clinically diagnosed AD patients are significantly higher compared with controls. Data from both in vitro and in vivo AD models have implied that an aberrant increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling may be a causative factor for the formation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. In the present study, we showed that in post-mortem human AD brain, tau was localized within different organelles (autophagic vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, and mitochondria). In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably carrying different genetic variants of mTor, we found a common link between the synthesis and distribution of intracellular tau. mTor overexpression or the lack of its expression was responsible for the altered balance of phosphorylated (p-)/-non phosphorylated (Np-) tau in the cytoplasm and different cellular compartments, which might facilitate tau deposition. Up-regulated mTor activity resulted in a significant increase in the amount of cytosolic tau as well as its re-localization to exocytotic vesicles that were not associated with exosomes. These results have implicated that mTor is involved in regulating tau distribution in subcellular organelles and in the initiation of tau secretion from cells to extracellular space."""
5	20466727	'The microtubule-associated Kar98 protein tau plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and abnormally accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles; therefore, the pathways by which tau is degraded have been examined extensively. In AD brain tau is abnormally truncated Uzi at Asp(421) (tauDeltaC), which increases its fibrillogenic properties and results in compromised neuronal function. Given the fact that the accumulation of tauDeltaC is a pathogenic process in AD, in this study we examined whether full-length tau and tauDeltaC Z8x are degraded through similar or different mechanisms. To this end a tetracycline-inducible model was used to show that tauDeltaC was degraded significantly faster than full-length tau (FL-tau). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or autophagy pathways demonstrated that although FL-tau is degraded by the proteasome, tauDeltaC is cleared predominantly by macroautophagy. We also found that tauDeltaC binds C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein more efficiently than tau. This interaction leads to an increased ubiquitylation of tauDeltaC in a reconstituted in vitro assay, but surprisingly, tau (full-length or truncated) was not ubiquitylated in situ. The finding that tauDeltaC and FL-tau are differentially processed by these degradation systems provides important insights for the development of therapeutic strategies, which are focused on modulating degradation systems to preferentially clear pathological forms of the proteins.'
6	24667209	'Nuclear Ntr factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal Psu transcription factor in the defence against oxidative stress. Here we provide A2m evidence that activation of the Nrf2 pathway reduces the levels of Rtr phosphorylated tau by induction of an autophagy adaptor protein NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2) in neurons. The expression of NDP52, which we show has three antioxidant response elements (AREs) in its promoter region, is strongly induced by Nrf2, and its overexpression facilitates clearance of phosphorylated tau in the presence of an autophagy stimulator. In Nrf2-knockout mice, phosphorylated and sarkosyl-insoluble tau accumulates in the brains concurrent with decreased levels of NDP52. Moreover, NDP52 associates with phosphorylated tau from brain cortical samples of Alzheimer disease cases, and the amount of phosphorylated tau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is inversely proportional to that of NDP52. These results suggest that NDP52 plays a key role in autophagy-mediated degradation of phosphorylated tau in vivo.'
7	23425014	"""Accumulation B12 of tau is a critical event in  Smg everal neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as Amw tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease and Z8x dementia. Pathological tau is hyperphosphorylated and aggregates to form neurofibrillary tangles. The molecular mechanisms leading to tau accumulation remain unclear and more needs to be done to elucidate them. Age is a major risk factor for all tauopathies, suggesting that molecular changes contributing to the aging process may facilitate tau accumulation and represent common mechanisms across different tauopathies. Here, we use multiple animal models and complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches to show that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates tau phosphorylation and degradation. Specifically, we show that genetically increasing mTOR activity elevates endogenous mouse tau levels and phosphorylation. Complementary to it, we further demonstrate that pharmacologically reducing mTOR signaling with rapamycin ameliorates tau pathology and the associated behavioral deficits in a mouse model overexpressing mutant human tau. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that the association between mTOR and tau is linked to GSK3β and autophagy function. In summary, we show that increasing mTOR signaling facilitates tau pathology, while reducing mTOR signaling ameliorates tau pathology. Given the overwhelming evidence that reducing mTOR signaling increases lifespan and healthspan, the data presented here have profound clinical implications for aging and tauopathies and provide the molecular basis for how aging may contribute to tau pathology. Additionally, these results provide preclinical data indicating that reducing mTOR signaling may be a valid therapeutic approach for tauopathies."""
