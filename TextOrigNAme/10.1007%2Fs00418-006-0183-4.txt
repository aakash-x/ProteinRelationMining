abstract a0, a cu(ii) thioxotriazole complex, produces
severe cytotoxic evects on ht1080 human wbrosarcoma
cells with a potency comparable to that exhibited by cis-
platin. a0 induced a characteristic series of changes, hall-
marked by the formation of eosin- and sudan black-b-
negative vacuoles. no evidence of nuclear fragmentation
or caspase-3 activation was detected in cells treated with
a0 which, rather, inhibited cisplatin-stimulated caspase-3
activity.  membrane  functional  integrity,  assessed  with
calcein  and  propidium  iodide,  was  spared  until  the  late
stages of the death process induced by the copper com-
plex.  vacuoles  were  negative  to  the  autophagy  marker
monodansylcadaverine  and  their  formation  was  not
blocked by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagic
processes.  negativity  to  the  extracellular  marker  pyra-
nine  excluded  vacuole  derivation  from  the  extracellular
xuid.  ultrastructural  analysis  indicated  that  a0  caused
the  appearance  of  many  electronlight  cytoplasmic  vesi-
cles,  possibly  related  to  the  endoplasmic  reticulum,
which  progressively  enlarge  and  coalesce  to  form  large
vacuolar structures that eventually  wll the cytoplasm. it
is  concluded  that  a0 triggers  a  non-apoptotic,  type  3b
programmed cell death (clarke in anat embryol (berl)

introduction
apoptosis is the best characterized type of programmed
cell death (pcd). however, other kinds of pcd do not
fulwll all the criteria generally associated with apoptosis.
examples of these non-apoptotic pcds are various types
of  cytoplasmic  cell  death  (clarke  1990).  although  less
well  dewned  than  apoptosis,  non-apoptotic  pcd  plays
important roles in physiological processes, such as devel-
opment (lockshin and zakeri 2004), as well as in patho-
logical  conditions,  such  as  neurodegenerative  diseases
(proskuryakov et al. 2003).
since the induction of apoptosis is a common mecha-
nism  of  action  of  anticancer  drugs,  it  is  not  surprising
that impairment of apoptotic mechanisms is often pres-
ent in cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy (kaufmann
and vaux 2003; longley and johnston 2005). however,
also  non-apoptotic  cell  death  has  been  detected  in
response to chemotherapeutic agents (leist and jaattela
2001)  even  in  apoptosis-resistant  cells  (roninson  et al.
2001; naito et al. 2004).
cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(ii) (cisplatin) is, thus far,
the  best  characterized  and  the  most  widely  employed
metal-based  anticancer  agent  (jakupec  et al.  2003).  this
drug triggers multiple cell responses such as dna repair,
inhibition of transcription, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis,
which represents the main cytotoxic end point of the drug
(siddik  2003).  signiwcant  side  evects  and  the  frequent
development of resistance to cisplatin chemotherapy have
prompted  the  search  for  new  agents.  in  particular,  com-
plexes based on endogenous metals, such as copper, may be
equally  evective  but  less  toxic  than  platinum  complexes.
previous  results  from  our  laboratory  have  demonstrated
that  a  copper(ii)  complex  of  4-amino-1,4-dihydro-
474
3-(2-pyridyl)-5-thioxo-1,2,4-triazole  (a0)  exhibits  a  sig-
niwcantly higher cytotoxic activity on the human wbrosar-
coma  cell  line  (ht1080)  than  on  normal  human  dermal
wbroblasts (dallavalle et al. 2002). in the present study we
have  evaluated  and  compared  the  biochemical  and  the
morphological changes induced by the treatment of ht1080
cells  with  cisplatin  or  a0,  demonstrating  that  the  copper-
based  drug  induces  cell  death  through  a  non-apoptotic
pcd that involves extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization.
materials and methods
materials
serum was obtained from euroclone, milan, italy. cal-
cein-am  and  pyranine  were  from  molecular  probes
(eugene, or). unless otherwise indicated, sigma (milan,
italy) was the source of all the others chemicals, includ-
ing the caspase 3 assay kit, and of the culture media.
assessment of cell death
cell death was assessed with trypan blue exclusion. after
a  24-h  treatment  with  either  a0  or  cisplatin,  both  at
25 ♯m,  the  medium  was  collected  and  the  cells  were
trypsinized.  cell  suspension  was  centrifuged  together
with  its  culture  medium  (5 min  at  800g)  and  the  pellet
suspended  in  50 ♯l  of  a  1:1  pbs-trypan  blue  solution.
dead  cells  were  counted  by  a  hemocytometer  and  ren-
dered as a percentage of stained cells.
flow cytometric dna analysis
after a 24-h treatment, trypsinized cells were centrifuged
together  with  their  culture  medium  and  the  pellet  was
washed with pbs and suspended in 500 ♯l citrate buver
containing  50 ♯l/ml  propidium  iodide,  1 mg/ml  ribonu-
clease  a,  and  0.1%  nonidet  p-40.  after  1 h  staining  in
the dark at 4°c, the samples were analyzed by means of a
facscan  xow  cytometer  (becton  dickinson,  san  jose,
ca) equipped with a doublet discrimination module.
cell line and cell culture conditions
caspase-3 activity
ht1080 cells, derived from a human wbrosarcoma, were
obtained from the istituto zooprowlattico sperimentale
(brescia,  italy)  and  grown  in  dulbecco’s  modiwed
eagle’s  medium  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  bovine
serum,  4 mm  glutamine,  100 u/ml  penicillin,  and  100
(g/ml  streptomycin.  cells  were  cultured  at  37°c  in  an
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air, ph 7.4.
drugs
the  a0  (cis-[cucl2(h2l)]cl)  copper(ii)  complex  of  hl
(4-amino-1,4-dihidro-3-(2-pyridyl)-5-thioxo-1,2,4-triaz-
ole) was synthesized as described previously (dallavalle
et al. 2002). a0 was freshly dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso) at a concentration of 40 mm before each exper-
iment.  cisplatin  was  dissolved  at  a  concentration  of
1 mm in 0.154 m nacl and frozen at ¡20°c.
assays
cell viability assay
after  a  24-h  treatment,  the  medium  was  collected  and
the  cells  were  harvested.  a  portion  of  the  culture  was
processed for caspase-3 activity employing a commercial
kit (caspase 3 assay kit, sigma). briexy, cell suspension
was  centrifuged  together  with  the  culture  medium  and
the  pellet  was  washed  with  pbs  and  suspended  in  lysis
buver  for  20 min.  after  a  15-min  centrifugation  at
18,000g  at  4°c,  caspase-3  activity  in  the  supernatants
was assessed with a colorimetric kit (caspase 3 assay kit,
sigma) in 96-well plates. absorbance of the cleaved cas-
pase-3  substrate  (ac-devd-pna)  was  read  at  405 nm
with a wallac 1420 victor2 multilabel counter and the
results calculated using a calibration curve of p-nitroani-
line (pna). another fraction of the cell population was
employed  for  the  western  analysis  of  caspase-3  (anti-
caspase-3 santa cruz, 1:1000) and (-tubulin (santa cruz,
1:500).  the  value  of  the  ratio  caspase-3/(-tubulin,
obtained from the densitometric analysis of the western
data, was employed to normalize caspase-3 activity.
confocal microscopy (clsm)
the cytotoxic evect of a0 on ht1080 cells was assessed
with the indicator resazurin, whose xuorescence is widely
employed  to  assess  cell  viability  (o’brien  et al.  2000).
cells were seeded in a complete growth medium in 96- or
24-well  plates  (costar  corning,  ny),  at  a  density  of,
respectively,  5£103  or  25£103 cells/well,  and  grown  for
24 h  before  treatment.  the  growth  medium  was  then
substituted with fresh medium containing the drug to be
tested  at  the  selected  concentration.  cell  viability  was
tested replacing the medium with a solution of resazurin
(44 ♯m) in complete medium. after 2 h, xuorescence was
measured at 572 nm with a xuorimeter (wallac 1420 vic-
tor2 multilabel counter, perkin elmer).
the morphology of the treated cells was studied with a
confocal system (multiprobe 2001, molecular dynamics,
sunnydale,  ca),  employing  a  microchamber  as  previ-
ously described (dall’asta et al. 1997). cells were seeded
on coverslips at a density of 2£104 cells/cm2 and treated
after  24 h.  the  vital  dye  calcein-am  was  employed  to
monitor  cell  morphology using  a  wnal concentration of
2 ♯m  (stock  solution  1 mm  in  dmso)  (gatti  et al.
1998).
phosphatydilserine  (ps)  exposure  was  assessed  with
annexin v-fitc staining, as previously described (gatti
et al. 1998), after a loading of 10 min with 1 (g/♯l annexin
v-fitc and propidium iodide in complete medium. due
to  the  interference  of  a0  with  calcein  and  annexin
v-fitc  xuorescence  (s.  tardito  and  r.  gatti,  unpub-
lished  observation),  the  a0-supplemented  medium  was
washed  away  immediately  before  probe  loading  and
replaced with drug-free medium.
for  nuclear  staining,  cells,  grown  on  slides  and
treated for 24 h, were wxed with frozen ethanol for 5 min,
washed  with  pbs,  and  stained  for  10 min  with  2 (g/ml
propidium iodide solution in pbs. for the evaluation of
the  endocytic  compartment,  cells  were 
incubated
throughout the experimental treatment, up to 24 h, with
100 ♯m pyranine, a  xuid phase cell impermeant marker
(rotoli et al. 2002).
for propidium iodide, excitation at 488 nm was used
and  emission  over  570 nm  was  selected  employing  a
570 nm  epixuorescence  long  pass  wlter.  for  all  other
probes  (♮ex  488 nm)  emission  was  recorded  through  a
510 nm  primary  beamsplitter  and  a  530 nm  dichroic
wlter.  in  all  cases  section  series  were  acquired  although
representative single plan sections are shown.
light and xuorescence microscopy
cells  were  observed  in  phase  contrast,  or  stained  with
standard  hematoxylin/eosin  or  sudan  black-b.  images
were  obtained  with  a  digital  camera  (nikon  ds5mc).
cells stained with hematoxylin/eosin were also observed
in confocal microscopy (bussolati et al. 1995).
to detect autophagic vacuoles, cells, grown on cover-
slips, were washed three times with pbs and stained with
100 ♯m  monodansylcadaverine  (mdc) in pbs  at 37°c
for 30 min (munafo and colombo 2001). after incuba-
tion,  the  cells  were  washed  four  times  with  pbs  and
immediately analyzed in xuorescence microscopy.
transmission electron microscopy
cells  were  incubated  for  24 h  in  the  absence  or  in  the
presence of  25 ♯m a0. cells  were then rinsed  with pbs
and wxed with karnowsky wxative [1.5% (v/v) glutaralde-
hyde  and  1%  paraformaldehyde  in  0.1 m  sodium  caco-
dylate,  ph  7.4].  after  wxation,  the  cells  were  washed  in
sodium  cacodylate,  scraped  and  pelleted  by  centrifuga-
tion. cell pellets were postwxed with 1% (v/v) osmic acid
in sodium cacodylate and stained with 1% uranyl acetate.
after  dehydration  pellets  were  embedded  in  durcopan
(fluka, sigma). ultrathin sections, obtained with a lkb
8800  ultratome  iii,  were  observed  with  an  electron
microscope, philips em 400t.

results
a0 and cisplatin have comparable cytotoxic evects 
on ht1080 cells
figure 1a,  shows  the  dose–response  curve  for  cytotoxic
evects  of  cisplatin  and  a0.  the  antiproliferative-cyto-
toxic evect of the two compounds on ht1080 cells was
tested  after  48 h  of  exposure  to  concentrations  ranging
from  1.25  to  100 ♯m.  the  ic50  values,  calculated  from
the two curves, were 5 ♯m (with a conwdence interval of
99%  ranging  between  4.5  and  5.5 ♯m)  and  12 ♯m  (11.5
and 12.5 ♯m) for cisplatin and a0, respectively. although
the  two  compounds  demonstrated  a  dose-dependent
evect, the a0 curve showed a steeper slope reaching 95%
of the evect already at 25 ♯m. for all the other experi-
ments  the drug  was  employed  at  this  concentration.  at
the  concentrations  reached  in  a  25 ♯m  a0  solution  in
complete  growth  medium,  neither  the  solvent  (dmso)
nor copper chloride alone had any appreciable evect on
cell viability (results not shown).
the time course of the a0 evect, shown in fig. 1b, was
comparable  to  that  exhibited  by  cisplatin,  indicating
that, after a 24-h treatment with either drug, viability was
decreased  by  50%  compared  to  the  control,  untreated
cells. at this experimental point, treated ht1080 cultures
presented heterogeneous and widespread signs of toxic-
ity  (fig. 1d).  compared  to  the  untreated  controls
(fig. 1c),  marked  cell  loss  was  evident  and  several  cells
appeared rounded and detached. while some cells were
grossly  spared,  others  presented  a  vacuolization  of  the
cytoplasm. the assessment of cell death with trypan blue
exclusion demonstrated that, after a 24-h treatment with
both a0 and cisplatin, 20–25% of the cells were positive
to the dye (not shown).
a0-induced cell death divers from apoptosis induced 
by cisplatin
figure 2 shows the morphology of cells treated with cis-
platin or a0 visualized in confocal microscopy with the
vital stain calcein-am. compared with control cultures
(fig. 2a),  the  cells  incubated  for  24 h  with  cisplatin
(fig. 2b)  exhibited  the  typical  morphological  hallmarks
of  apoptosis,  as  detected  with  this  method  (gatti  et al.
1998):  rounded  shape,  nuclear  condensation  with  pyk-
notic  fragmentation,  intense  blebbing,  and  the  detach-
ment  of  intensely  calcein-positive  bodies  (arrowhead).
on  the  contrary,  a0  (fig. 2c)  did  not  induce  clear-cut
apoptotic changes. rather, after 24 h of treatment a het-
erogeneous  pattern  could  be  observed,  possibly  corre-
sponding  to  the  asynchronous  progression  of  the
population through the process. roughly 25% of the cell
population appeared wlled with large, apparently calcein-
negative  vacuoles  (v).  in  these  cells,  cytoplasm  at  wrst
formed a perimembranous rim that still outlined the cell
shape  to  become  progressively  squeezed  in  the  perinu-
clear zone. the development of vacuoles was compatible

no widespread membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmen-

form, while some (see the inset to fig. 2c) were only seen
at diverent plans, suggesting that they were almost com-
pletely  detached  and  only  loosely  adherent  to  the  sub-
strate. however, all these cells retained calcein positivity,
thus  indicating  that  membrane  integrity  was  spared  till
the late phases of the death process.
the  absence  of  apoptotic  hallmarks  in  a0-treated
cells prompted us to evaluate the evects of the treatment
on  caspase  activity.  figure 3  represents  the  caspase-3
activity determined from the cleavage of the xuorogenic
substrate devd-pna in lysates of ht1080 cells treated
for  24 h  with  cisplatin  or  a0,  or  exposed  for  diverent
periods  to  a0  during  a  24-h  treatment  with  cisplatin.
data  have  been  normalized  for  the  expression  of  cas-
pase-3  protein.  upon  treatment  with  25 ♯m  cisplatin
alone, ht1080 cells exhibited a 12-fold higher caspase-3
activity  compared with untreated  cells.  the presence of
a0 during cisplatin treatment lowered the caspase activ-
ity  with  respect  to  cisplatin  alone,  with  a  50%  decrease
detectable after 12 h of a0 treatment. in cells exposed for
24 h to both cisplatin and a0, caspase activity was inhib-
ited by more than 90% compared with cells treated with
fig. 2 morphology of cisplatin and a0-treated ht1080 cells. cells,
seeded on coverslips, were incubated for 24 h in the absence (control,

the  cells  treated  with  either  drug  (result  not  shown).  in
the cells treated with a0 alone, caspase activity was not
signiwcantly diverent from the control, untreated cells.
in  several  cell  models,  caspase-3-mediated  protein
cleavage is associated to nuclear fragmentation, a typical
feature of apoptosis. figure 4a–c reports the cytoxuori-
metric detection of dna strand breaks in ht1080 cells
treated  with  a0  or  cisplatin.  facs  analysis  demon-
strated  that  a  24-h  treatment  with  cisplatin  induced
nuclear  fragmentation,  revealed  as  a  hypodiploid  frac-
tion of 21.5% (fig. 4b), compared with a 2.7% detected in
the  control,  untreated  cells  (fig. 4a).  conversely,  a0-
treated  cells  did  not  show  any  increase  in  nuclear  frag-

incubated for the indicated periods in normal growth medium (con-
trol, empty bar) or in media supplemented with cisplatin and/or a0
(solid  bars).  when  employed  together  with  cisplatin  for  periods
shorter than 24 h, a0 was added in the last portion of the cisplatin
treatment. at the end of the incubations, caspase-3 activity was eval-
uated as described in methods. both drugs were employed at 25 ♯m.

mentation (3.1% of events, fig. 4c). morphological anal-
ysis  with  propidium  iodide  (see  the  insets  of  fig. 4a–c)
conwrmed that nuclear fragmentation was clearly detect-
able  in  cisplatin-treated  cultures  (fig. 4b),  while  cells
treated with a0 (fig. 4c) exhibited only an increased con-
densation  of  chromatin  compared  to  the  control
(fig. 4a).
phosphatidylserine exposure is an event described in
several examples of apoptosis induced by cisplatin, such
as  in  cho  cells  (boersma  et al.  1996;  cummings  and
schnellmann 2002), and ht1080 cells (s. tardito and r.
franchi-gazzola,  unpublished  observation).  to  detect
the ps exposure in a0-treated cells, we observed cultures
with  confocal  microscopy  after  the  simultaneous  addi-
tion of annexin-v  and  propidium iodide to  the  incuba-
tion  medium  (fig. 5).  while  vacuolized  cells  still
adherent to the culture substratum were annexin-v-neg-
ative, a widespread annexin-v positivity was detected in
a0-treated cells detaching from the substrate or showing
extensive formation of giant round bodies. some of these
elements were both annexin-v and pi-positive, thus indi-
cating  that  they  had  lost  membrane  integrity,  although
nuclear morphology was still relatively spared.
characterization of vacuoles induced by a0
is  an  ubiquitous 
autophagy 
intracellular  pathway
responsible for the degradation  of most long-lived pro-
teins  and  organelles  and  can  lead  to  cell  death  (see  for
review cuervo 2004; gozuacik and kimchi 2004). mor-
phological signs of autophagic cell death correspond to
the appearance of autophagic vesicles, autophagosomes,
that increase in size and number during the process. the
direct  assessment  of  autophagosomes  in  ht1080  cells
was performed with the speciwc xuorescent probe mdc
(fig. 6). in the control cells (fig. 6a–c), mdc positivity
is clearly detected and is more evident in the perinuclear
zone (fig. 6b, c). also a0-treated cells (fig. 6d–f) exhib-
ited an evident mdc positivity (fig. 6e) but, if the mdc
image  was  combined  with  a  phase  contrast  image,  the
merger image (fig. 6d) indicated that the mdc-positive

imum  of  20,000  cells  per  sample  was  acquired.  the  percentage  of

absence of the eosin signal in the vacuoles and the pres-
ence  of  a  condensed,  extremely  positive  eosinophylic
cytoplasm  in  the  perinuclear  zone  (arrowhead).  on  the
other  hand,  negativity  to  sudan  black-b  (fig. 7c)  indi-
cated that vacuoles were not wlled with lipid material.
the  nature  and  origin  of  the  vacuoles  were  further
investigated in the experiments reported in fig. 8. pyra-
nine, an extracellular, membrane impermeant xuorescent
marker, was used to assess if the vacuoles content derives
from  the  endocytosis  of  the  extracellular  xuid  phase.
cells  incubated  for  24 h  with  both  a0  and  pyranine
showed  a  low  intracellular  signal  (compare  with  the
highly positive extracellular compartment) that roughly
outlined vesicular compartments, thus possibly suggest-
ing dye trapping during the endocytic recycling pathway.
however,  although  some  pyranine-positive  vesicles
could  be  visualized  in  the  treated  or  control  cells  (not
shown),  no  xuorescent  signal  was  detected  inside  the
giant  vacuoles  demonstrating  that  there  was  no  signiw-
cant contribution of endocytosis in the formation of the
vacuolar compartment induced by a0.
figure 9  presents  the  ultrastructural  features  of  the
death process induced by a0. the em images of the con-
trol  cell  (fig. 9a,  b)  are  compared  with  several  treated

phase  (fig. 9c)  many  small  electronlight  vesicles  (v)

consistently,  the  autophagy  inhibitor  3-methylade-
nine (seglen and gordon 1982), employed in a range of

the  cytotoxicity  or  the  vacuolization  caused  by  a0
(results  not  shown).  after  standard  hematoxylin–eosin

tage of the intrinsic xuorescence of eosin (bussolati et al.

treated with a0 consists in a massive cytoplasmic vacuo-
lization,  a  phenomenon  absent  in  cells  treated with cis-
platin. the latter agent induces caspase-3 activation and
nuclear fragmentation, pointing to a classical apoptotic
pathway  (cummings  and  schnellmann  2002).  on  the
contrary, no evidence of either feature has been detected
in  the  a0-treated  cells,  thus  excluding  that  the  copper
complex  triggers  an  apoptotic  pathway.  indeed,  while
selected  examples  of  caspase-independent  or  nuclear
fragmentation-independent  apoptotic  deaths  have  been
described  (see  for  review,  respectively,  kolenko  et al.
2000;  and  ferri  and  kroemer  2000),  the  simultaneous
absence of both features is considered a hallmark of non-
apoptotic  cell  death  (szende  et al.  1995;  sasaki  et al.
2003;  guo  et al.  2003;  wojcik  et al.  2004;  kelly  et al.
2004;  wang  et al.  2004;  hirai  and  harada  2004;  nau-
mann et al. 2004). the results presented also demonstrate
that a0 inhibits the activation of caspase-3 caused by cis-
platin.  it  is,  therefore,  possible  that  the  a0-treated  cells
are prevented to undergo an apoptotic pathway because
the drugs inhibits caspases.
it  is  known  that  copper  thiosemicarbazones  are
endowed with a high cu(ii)/cu(i) redox cycling capabil-
ity (byrnes et al. 1990). given the similarities of the (n,s)
donor  set  between  thiosemicarbazones  and  thioxotriaz-
oles, such as the ligand of a0 (dallavalle et al. 2002), a0
may  induce  a  signiwcant  oxidative  stress.  other  metal-
based  compounds,  such  as  rhodium–ferrocene  com-
plexes,  were  recently  discovered  to  trigger  cell  death
without  triggering  apoptosis  (weber  et al.  2004).  how-
ever, oncotic changes were clearly detectable in that case
(weber et al. 2004). in the case of a0, on the contrary, the
absence  of  permeability  to  extracellular  dyes  and  the
maintenance of calcein positivity indicate that the mem-
brane barrier function is spared until the late phases of
the process, thus excluding the occurrence of an acciden-
tal  death  of  oncotic  type.  this  conclusion  is  also  sup-
ported  by  ultrastructural  data 
that  document
identiwable,  relatively  spared  mitochondria  even  in  the
severely altered cells. instead, the a0-treated cells appear
to undergo a dewnite sequence of changes: a multitude of
cytoplasmic vesicles appear, while the tubular endoplas-
mic  reticulum,  observed  in  control  cells,  is  no  more
detectable; vesicles tend to swell and become large, coa-
lescent  vacuoles,  implying  a  progressive  intracellular
osmotic derangement; eventually, most  of the  cytoplas-
mic space is replaced by vacuolar formations.
in a0-treated cultures, several cells that have lost the
adherent shape exhibit a positivity to annexin-v, indicat-
ing  the  outward  exposure  of  phosphatidylserine,  a  fea-
ture  postulated  in  the  past  to  be  speciwc  for  apoptotic
death. however, non-apoptotic cell death and phosphati-
dylserine  exposure  are  not  mutually  exclusive  since  the
latter phenomenon occurs also in oncotic (krysko et al.
2004)  and  in  late  necrotic  cells  (hirt  and  leist  2003).
interestingly, annexin-v-positive cells appear only in the
advanced  phases  of  the  death  pathway  activated  by  a0
treatment.  moreover,  vacuolar  lesions,  the  hallmark  of
a0-induced toxicity, fully develop in the absence of ann-

(fig. 9a,  b),  these  structures  are  no  more  detectable  in
vacuole-positive  cells,  although  ribosomes  are  still
detectable  on  the  membranes  of  some  vesicles  (fig. 9f).
some  of  the  vacuoles  are  in  close  relationship  with  the
nucleus  (fig. 9g,  i).  alterations  are  also  exhibited  by
some mitochondria, which swell and present misshaped
cristae, although they remain clearly distinguishable, for
size  and  electrondensity,  from  the  vesicles  (fig. 9d).
however, even in the advanced stages of the process, the
relatively  spared  mitochondria  are  still  detectable
(fig. 9h). the nuclei of the treated cells (fig. 9e, g) pres-
ent a peripheral chromatin margination but no signs of
fragmentation.  in  the  terminal  phase  (fig. 9j)  the  cyto-
plasmic remnant was squeezed at the center of the cells
with  a  well  dewned  cytoplasmic  rim  still  interposed
between the vacuole(s) and the plasma membrane.
in fig. 10 the time course of the a0-induced vacuoli-
zation was followed in a single cell with time lapse pho-
tographic  images.  compared  to  the  control  (fig. 10a),
cells  treated  with  25 ♯m  a0  exhibited  the  wrst  signs  of
cytoplasmic changes after 18 h of incubation (fig. 10b).
at 24 h (fig. 10c), as expected, vacuolization was evident
and the vacuoles had almost completely  wlled the cyto-
plasm.  at  this  time,  the  replacement  of  the  a0-supple-
mented  medium  with  fresh,  drug-free  medium  did  not
reverse  the  death  process  that  proceeded  (fig. 10d,  e)
until  the  cell  became  rounded  and  highly  birefringent
(fig. 10f). image acquisition was favored by the substan-
tial inhibition of cell motility detected in vacuolated cells.

in this report we have compared the evects produced in
human  wbrosarcoma  ht1080  cells  by  cisplatin  and  by
a0,  a  novel  copper  complex  proposed  as  an  anticancer
agent. despite the comparable cytotoxicity produced by
the two drugs, the death patterns involved appear mark-

the  cytotoxic  evects  of  a0  are  not  restricted  to
ht1080  wbrosarcoma  cells.  in  a  panel  of  15  human
tumor cell lines, 7 exhibit a remarkable sensitivity to the
copper-complex  drug  (s.  tardito  et al.,  manuscript  in
preparation).  interestingly,  all  the  a0-sensitive  lines
undergo a progressive cell vacuolization as a result of the
treatment.  therefore  cytoplasmic  vacuolization  can  be
considered the hallmark of the death process induced by
the drug.
a0-induced vacuoles have been investigated with sev-
eral markers as well as with electron microscopy. due to
the reported involvement of autophagic processes in cell
toxicity induced by chemical agents (bursch et al. 1996;
kanzawa et al. 2004, 2005), we have tested the hypothe-
sis  that  a0  induces  autophagy.  autophagy  may also be
suggested  by  the  presence  of  cytoplasmic  double-mem-
brane  structures,  detected  occasionally  in  vacuoles.
however,  structures  resembling  cytoplasmic  organelles
were never observed  in  vacuoles. moreover, the lack of
inhibition  of  a0  cytotoxicity  by  the  well  known  auto-
phagy  inhibitor  3-methyladenine  and  the  negativity  of
a0-induced vacuoles to the autophagy marker mdc are
not consistent with a causal role of autophagic processes
in the cell death induced by the drug. autophagy is also
excluded by the empty appearance of vacuoles in phase
contrast  and  by  the  scarce  presence  of  electrondense
material in vacuolar space, two  wndings consistent with
the substantial absence of proteins and lipids in the vacu-
olar  compartment.  moreover,  lysosomal  involvement  is
unlikely  due  to  the  massive  dimensions  reached  by  the
vacuoles and to their negativity to acridine orange (data
not shown). while some mitochondria appear altered in
the a0-treated cells (fig. 9d), others are relatively spared
until the late phases of the death process (fig. 9h), thus
excluding  an  essential  role  of  mitochondria  in  vacuole
formation. the involvement of structures related to the
endoplasmic reticulum in vacuole formation is suggested
by  (1)  the  simultaneous  appearance  of  the  vesicles  and
the disappearance of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum;
(2)  the  intimate  relationship  of  some  vacuoles  with  the
nucleus, pointing to their origin from the perinuclear cis-
terna;  and  (3)  the  presence  of  ribosomes  on  the  mem-
brane of some vacuoles, even in the advanced phases of
the death process (see fig. 9f). this wnding is particularly
481
signiwcant, given that at the experimental time employed
(24 h of treatment), protein synthesis is already lowered
by more than 60% (s. tardito and r. franchi-gazzola,
unpublished results).
thus, a0-induced cell death is consistent with the fea-
tures  of  type  3b  cell  death  described  by  clarke  (1990),
characterized by dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum,
nuclear envelope, or other organelles. the morphological
features  of  these  cells  remind  us  of  a  distinctive,  non-
apoptotic pcd, sometimes named paraptosis (sperandio
et al.  2000),  in  which  the  enlargement  of  reticular  com-
partments,  due  to  an  uncharacterized 
intracellular
osmotic disequilibrium, forms apparently empty spaces,
sparing the plasma membrane until the late phases of the
death process, eventually accompanied by cells rounding
and detachment (hirai and harada 2004).
if  a0  activates  a  paraptotic  pathway,  then  the  cop-
per(ii)  complex  would  represent  the  wrst  example  of  an
anticancer drug able to trigger this particular pcd. many
tumor  cells  are  resistant  to  classical  chemotherapeutic
agents since they are endowed with mutations that inacti-
vate apoptotic machinery or activate anti-apoptotic path-
ways. therefore, the characterization of novel, apoptotis-
independent anticancer drugs appears to be signiwcantly
relevant for possible therapeutic applications.
