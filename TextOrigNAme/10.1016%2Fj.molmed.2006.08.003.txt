the primary function of autophagy in most cell types is
adaptation to starvation. because neurons are protected
from this type of stress, the physiological role of
autophagy in normal functioning neurons was, until
now, poorly understood. using genetic manipulations
to block autophagy in neurons selectively, mizushima‚Äôs
and tanaka‚Äôs groups have recently presented conclusive
evidence for an essential role of constitutive autophagy
in neuronal survival. these studies provide new insights
into the relationship between autophagy malfunction-
ing and neurodegenerative disorders.
autophagy reaches the head
autophagy refers
to the global process by which
intracellular components (soluble proteins and organelles)
are degraded in lysosomes. since the Ô¨Årst descriptions of
this process, almost 50 years ago, the word ‚Äòstarvation‚Äô had
been invariably associated to the term ‚Äòautophagy‚Äô because
its only accepted function was to degrade intracellular
proteins to provide amino acids during poor nutritional
conditions. based on this function, it is easy to infer why
autophagy was considered crucial in tissues (e.g. the liver)
that undergo major metabolic readjustments depending
on the nutritional status, whereas its role or even its
existence in the brain ‚Äì traditionally considered protected
from nutritional starvation ‚Äì was unclear. two recent
reports provide conclusive genetic evidence for a crucial
role of autophagy in the continuous turnover of cytoplasmic
contents in neurons, and show this process to be
essential for cell survival [1,2]. in fact, disruption of
autophagy in neurons results in neurodegeneration, thus
linking alterations in this pathway to the pathogenesis
of detrimental neurodegenerative disorders such as
alzheimer‚Äôs, parkinson‚Äôs and huntington‚Äôs disease.
novel autophagic functions
intracellular components can be delivered to lysosomes for
degradation by different mechanisms that give rise to
three different
types of autophagy: macroautophagy,
microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy
[3‚Äì6] (box 1). macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as
autophagy, is quantitatively the most important type of
autophagy. recent studies have contributed to expanding
the understanding of the functions and intracellular pro-
cesses in which autophagy is involved. in addition to the
known role of autophagy in the cellular adaptation
to nutritional stress, autophagy also participates in

and extrinsic
development, cell differentiation and tissue remodeling,
intrinsic
immunity, host-to-pathogen
response, mechanisms related to cell death and cell survi-
val in response to intracellular and extracellular stresses,
and the removal of toxic or altered components from inside
the cells [3‚Äì6].
autophagy and neurodegeneration
the role of autophagy as part of the intracellular quality
control systems has directly linked this process to protein
conformational disorders and neurodegeneration [7]. in
these pathologies, a particular protein ‚Äòmisbehaves‚Äô owing
to pre- or post-transcriptional modiÔ¨Åcations, and orga-
nizes in complex soluble structures (oligomers or Ô¨Åbrils)
that are toxic for the cells or in insoluble aggregates
that interfere with intracellular trafÔ¨Åcking. neurological
malfunctions are often the hallmark of these disorders
because neurons are particularly sensitive to toxic pro-
teins, which eventually aggregate forming inclusion
bodies. the fact that the defect or alteration in the protein
is in many instances present already at birth but cellular
death does not occur until late in life supports the exis-
tence of cellular surveillance systems that efÔ¨Åciently
remove the toxic protein at an early stage. a combination
of aggravating factors (e.g. oxidative stress), which lead
to an increase in the amount of toxic proteins, and/or a
functional decay of the surveillance systems with age [8]
might explain this late onset. both, the ubiquitin protea-
some system and autophagy can participate in protein
quality control and in the removal of altered forms of
protein.
autophagy entered the picture of neurodegenerative
disorders as a neuronal killer. the massive accumulation
of autophagic vacuoles reported in dying neurons led to the
idea that cells were eating themselves as a way of destruc-
tion [7]. however, recent work has demonstrated that
pharmacological activation of autophagy reduces the
toxicity that is associated with expression of the altered
proteins in different neurodegenerative disorders [7,9].
reduced toxicity correlates with the ability of autophagy
to remove aggregates that contain the altered form of
protein [9,10]. in light of these results, the upregulation
of autophagy that is observed in many neurodegenerative
disorders was proposed to be a defensive mechanism
that is activated to compensate for the blockage of other
proteolytic systems [11,12] (figure 1, left).

box 1. types of autophagy
types of autophagy have been described in
three different
mammalian cells, depending on the mechanisms used to deliver
the cargo (i.e. components to be degraded)
into lysosomes.
macroautophagy and microautophagy carry cytosolic components
‚Äòin bulk‚Äô to lysosomes, whereas in chaperone-mediated autophagy
soluble proteins are selectively internalized one-by-one into lyso-
somes [3‚Äì5]. macroautophagy and microautophagy degrade not
only soluble proteins but also complete organelles, which are
directly engulfed by the lysosome,
through invaginations or
protrusions of its membrane, in the case of microautophagy, or
are first sequestered by a membrane that closes to form a double-
membrane vacuole that then fuses with lysosomes, in the case of
macroautophagy [5]. although macroautophagy was initially de-
scribed in mammals, it has been by yeast genetic screens that the
main molecular components of this process (autophagy-related
proteins, atgs) have been identified and the mechanisms of its
regulation have started to be understood [3,5]. the identification of
autophagy-related genes (atg) helped the development of tools to
track this process in cells and tissues, and now also enables
manipulations of this pathway to understand the cellular conse-
quences of changing autophagic activity in whole organisms.
to stressors, mizushima‚Äôs and tanaka‚Äôs groups [1,2] have
recently provided conclusive evidence for the existence of
constitutive autophagy in neurons, and elegantly demon-
strated that this process is essential for neuronal survival
(figure 1, right).
these two groups have shown, using two different
neuronal-speciÔ¨Åc conditional knockout mice for essential
autophagic genes (atg5 and atg7), that absence of
autophagy in neurons results in neurodegeneration
(accumulation of cytosolic polyubiquitinated inclusion
bodies, massive neuronal
loss in the cerebral and
cerebellar cortices, progressive deÔ¨Åcits in motor function
and premature death).
proof for constitutive autophagy in neurons has been
elusive because, in contrast to other cells, autophagic
vacuoles are rarely visible in neurons by electron micro-
scopy or even when Ô¨Çuorescent reporters are used [13,14].
the severe neuronal phenotype that has been observed in
these two mouse models that do not have autophagy, in the
absence of added stressors, conclusively supports consti-
tutive activity for this pathway. the inability to detect
autophagy in neurons might reÔ¨Çect, indeed, a much more
efÔ¨Åcient clearance of autophagic vacuoles by lysosomes in
these cells compared with that in other cell types.
the second most striking and unexpected Ô¨Ånding in
these novel mouse models is that blockage of autophagy
leads to neurodegeneration even in the absence of a
prone-to-aggregate protein that is considered to be the
main cause for activation of autophagy in protein con-
formational disorders. it is thus expected that the role
of this pathway will become even more crucial when one
figure 1. (a) before mizushima‚Äôs and tanaka‚Äôs studies [1,2] performed in mice that have selective blockage of autophagy in neurons, it was not clear whether autophagy
had a role in neuronal physiology or whether it existed in these cells in normal conditions (top). in chronic neurodegenerative disorders (bottom), it was hypothesized that
autophagy is activated in response to failure of other proteolytic systems and/or to the presence of protein aggregates. (b) mizushima‚Äôs and tanaka‚Äôs groups [1,2] have
shown that in mice that have selective neuronal blockage of autophagy, under normal conditions (top), constitutive activation of autophagy is essential for neuronal
survival. this process is responsible for the turnover of both cytosolic soluble proteins (including polyubiquitinated proteins) and organelles. in chronic neurodegenerative
disorders (bottom) neuronal death might result from failure of constitutive autophagy because of a direct effect of the altered proteins in this process or as a result of its
overloading when other proteolytic pathways fail.

box 2. outstanding questions
 how different is constitutive macroautophagy from inducible
macroautophagy? are they both present in all cells and tissues?
do they obey the same regulatory mechanisms? do they both
involve the same molecular machinery? do they target the same
type of cargo for degradation?
 what is the relationship between protein ubiquitinitation and
autophagy? are ubiquitinated proteins turned over continuously
via macroautophagy, or does ubiquitination occur in proteins that
cannot be properly eliminated from the cytosol through other
systems of elimination?
 what is the relationship between macroautophagy and other
forms of autophagy, and with the ubiquitin√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúproteasome system?
failure of all these systems is common in most neurodegenerative disorders: what does fail first? what can be compensated for?
do these systems work cooperatively? what determines this
cross-talk between proteolytic systems?
 are constitutive and inducible macroautophagy equally affected by
age and in neurodegenerative disorders? is the decline with age in
constitutive macroautophagy responsible for poor intracellular
clearance and progressive accumulation of undesired cytosolic
components in aged brains? or is it rather the inability of old cells or
cells affected by these diseases to upregulate macroautophagy in
response to stressors that leads to saturation of clearance systems
and to intracellular accumulation of toxic components?
of these products, as in the case of neurodegenerative
disorders, is added to the equation. the presence of
neuronal inclusion bodies, progressive accumulation of
abnormal proteins and neuronal loss, in the absence of a
harmful causative protein, make these mice possible
candidates as accelerated models for physiological aging
of the brain. the decrease in autophagy with age,
observed in most tissues and organisms, has been proposed to contribute to malfunctioning of aged cells [8].
mizushima√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and tanaka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s studies [1,2] provide unequivocal support for the contribution of autophagy failure to
the accumulation of altered proteins and organelles in
aged cells. both mouse models display increased levels of
soluble polyubiquitinated proteins, probably cleared in
part by √¢‚Ç¨Àúin bulk√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ autophagy. similar genetic blockage of
autophagy in the liver [15] associates to major alterations
in organelles, in particular mitochondria, as a result of their
poor turnover. malfunctioning mitochondria become
sources of reactive oxygen species, further contributing to
the accumulation of altered proteins in these cells. the
fact that intact autophagic function is essential for survival
of neural cells opens the possibility that the decline in
autophagy with age contributes to the progressive neuronal
loss that is typical of aged organisms.
different from neurodegeneration that is induced by a
√¢‚Ç¨Àúmisbehaving√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ protein or that observed in aged tissues,
where alterations in many proteolytic systems are common, neurodegeneration that is associated with complete
autophagic blockage does not seem to involve failure, at
least of the proteasome [2]. it is possible that, although
primary blockage of the proteasome in some neurodegenerative disorders can be partially compensated for by
upregulating autophagy, unique properties of autophagy,
such as its ability to degrade organelles, make replacement
of autophagy by the proteasome unfeasible. however, it
is also plausible that the partial blockage of autophagy
in neurodegenerative disorders enables compensatory

activation of other systems, which might eventually fail
because of overloading (figure 1, right), whereas the complete autophagic blockage in the genetic models prevents
activation of compensatory mechanisms.
the effects of different degrees of autophagic failure on
neuronal survival, the consequences of autophagic blockage at different stages in the course of the disease and the
state of other forms of autophagy in these models deserve
further investigation (box 2). answers to these questions
might offer valuable clues in deciphering whether restoration of normal autophagic function or enhanced autophagic
activity should be seeked out as possible therapeutics for
neurodegenerative disorders.
concluding remarks
the recent works by mizushima√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and tanaka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s groups
[1,2] present for the first time compelling evidence for the
role of autophagy in continuous cellular clearance √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú a task
attributed to autophagy since it was first described, but
never, until now, conclusively proved. furthermore, these
studies have put a spin on the proposed role for autophagy
in neurodegenerative disorders, which should have major
consequences on any future therapeutic interventions
based on autophagy manipulation. thus, rather than an
exclusive focus on upregulation of macroautophagy for the
removal of protein aggregates, emphasis should now also
be placed on understanding the mechanisms and regulation of this novel constitutive autophagic activity and on
clarifying its contribution to the removal of intracellular
soluble toxic proteins, aggregate proteins or both. when
the first studies showed that pharmacological upregulation
of macroautophagy in different models for neurodegeneration diminished cell toxicity [7,9], one of the major concerns
was: how long can one activate autophagy without detrimental consequences for the cells? mizushima√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s and tanaka√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s studies [1,2] gave the answer: forever, as normal
neurons have some level of activity at all times. therefore,
it is not a matter of time but of extent, and the challenge is
now to learn to tweak autophagy to keep it at the needed
level at all times.
