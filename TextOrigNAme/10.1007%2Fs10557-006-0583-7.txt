abstract
introduction programmed cell death of cardiac myo-
cytes occurs following a bout of ischemia/reperfusion
(i/r), which results in reduced function of the heart.
numerous studies, including in vivo, have shown that
cell death occurs via necrosis and apoptosis following
i/r. recently, autophagy has emerged as a powerful
mediator of programmed cell death, either opposing or
enhancing apoptosis, or acting as an alternative form
of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis.
aim here we review the apoptotic and autophagic
signaling pathways, their influences on each other, and
we discuss the relevance of autophagy in the heart.

introduction
the heart is a muscular pump which is responsible for
circulating blood throughout the body,
in order to
deliver cells with nutrients and oxygen, as well as to
carry away their waste products. the human heart
begins beating at approximately 4–5 weeks following
conception and continues, hopefully uninterrupted,
until death, beating about three billion times. approx-
imately one-third of all deaths in the western industri-
alized world are caused by the effects of acute or
chronic limitations to coronary blood flow [175]. many
of these deaths are attributable to modifiable risk
factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and smoking [46,
132], whose prevalence continues to increase through-
out the world. thus, in all likelihood, heart disease will
remain a leading cause of death for generations to come.
a myocardial infarction occurs when a coronary
artery supplying oxygen-rich blood to a region of the
heart is blocked (e.g., due to coronary obstruction,
surgical clamp, heart transplantation). the resulting
condition of low oxygen and nutrient supply is termed
ischemia (from greek:
to hold back, and
haima,
blood), and is accompanied by decreased
intracellular availability of atp, and low ph, partly
due to increased lactate concentrations. following a
bout of ischemia, reperfusion (e.g., via vasodilator
pharmaceuticals, angioplasty) must be achieved in
order to prevent the irreversible destruction of affect-
ed tissues. paradoxically, reperfusion itself causes
damage and subsequent cell death. this condition is
referred to as ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury.

myocardial cell death during i/r injury
it has been established that following i/r, cell death
occurs via both necrosis and apoptosis [80], two dis-
tinct modes of death. necrosis (greek for: death, causing
to die) is a degenerative process in which cellular
integrity is lost and the release of cytosolic contents
provokes an inflammatory response [155]. ischemia
446
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445â€“462
induces necrosis in a certain subset of cells, whereby the
extent of necrotic cell loss is a function of the duration
of the ischemic insult [113]. necrotic cells are mainly
found in the central zone of the infarct.
in contrast, apoptosis (from greek:
falling off,
figurative for the falling of leaves; also termed pro-
grammed cell death (pcd) type i) is a highly regulat-
ed, genetically determined mechanism that does not
provoke an inflammatory response [149]. moreover,
apoptosis requires energy in form of atp for its suc-
cessful completion. apoptosis plays a role in pathophys-
iological conditions but is also essential in normal tissue
homeostasis, allowing the organ or tissue to rid itself of
cells which are dysfunctional or no longer needed.
apoptotic cell death is characterized by cell shrinkage,
membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation and
degradation. the cell is eventually broken into small
membrane-enclosed pieces (apoptotic bodies), which in
vivo are removed by macrophages, or taken up by
neighboring cells. this prevents the release of cellular
compounds and thus ensures that an inflammatory
response is not provoked. in i/r injury, apoptotic cell
loss manifests itself during the reperfusion period due
to the slowly orchestrated execution of the apoptotic
cell death program, and is more apparent at the margin-
al zone of the infarct. in addition to its contribution to
i/r injury, apoptosis has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases includ-
ing nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [152] and
congestive heart failure [120, 125].
autophagy, a lysosomal degradative pathway, has
recently emerged as an important mediator of pcd
pathways. inhibition of autophagy can trigger apopto-
sis [15], and upregulation of autophagy protects against
apoptotic stimuli [138]. however, under certain con-
ditions anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family
members activate autophagy to trigger a form of pro-
grammed cell death [81, 159]. furthermore, autophagy
can function as a second mode of programmed cell
death (pcd type ii) distinct from apoptosis, termed
autophagic cell death [20]. in this review we present
the apoptotic and autophagic pathways and discuss
recent findings concerning the role of autophagy and
nature of crosstalk between these pathways. finally we
discuss the role of autophagy deciding the fate of the
cardiac myocyte.
pathways and executers of apoptosis (pcd type i)
pcd pathways present a target for reducing the size of
the infarct, and thus preserving myocardial function
following i/r. in the heart, apoptosis is mediated by
two central pathways, the receptor-mediated (extrin-
sic) and the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway [35]
both of which are depicted in fig. 1. so-called
caspases, a family of cysteine aspartate proteases, are
the main effectors of, and allow for crosstalk between,
both pathways [164, 176]. caspases are synthesized as
inactive precursors and generally activated by proteo-
lytic cleavage of the procaspase form to the catalyti-
cally active heterotetramer [157].
receptor-mediated death pathway
the receptor-mediated (extrinsic) pathway is initiated by
the binding of a death ligand (e.g., cd95/fas ligand,
tnf-a) to its cognate cell surface death receptor (e.g.,
cd95/fas, tnf-a receptor) [6, 151]. consequently, death
adapter molecules such as fadd (fas-associated
death domain) and tradd (tnf receptor-associated
death domain) form homotrimers which are recruited
to the cytoplasmic tail of the death receptor through
death domains^ present in both
interactions between
proteins [29, 69, 171]. subsequently, procaspase 8 is
recruited to the complex, resulting in proximity-induced
processing [119]. once activated, caspase 8 initiates the
apoptotic cascade via processing of downstream effector
caspases such as caspase 3 [122, 174], as well as the pro-
apoptotic bcl-2 family member, bid [103], leading to the
death of the cell.
recently, the receptor-mediated death pathway was
linked to the progression of heart disease: mice lacking
functional fas exhibited smaller infarcts following a
model of in vivo i/r injury [99], while increased levels
of fas ligand are present in congestive heart failure
[154, 192] and were associated with i/r-induced
apoptosis of cardiac myocytes [80]. likewise, increased
tnfa production was reported to occur during myo-
cardial i/r injury and was linked to mitochondrial
damage [87, 100].
mitochondrial death pathway
under pathophysiological conditions (e.g., enhanced
oxidative stress and/or calcium overload) mitochondria
participate in the apoptotic pathway [43, 55]. death
signals transmitted to the mitochondria lead to the
release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochon-
drial
intermembrane space to the cytosol, through
pathways which are still subject to much debate and
investigation. the majority of studies focused on the
release of cytochrome c, which normally functions as
part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
two main models have been proposed to describe the
mechanism(s) of cytochrome c release to the cytosol
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445â€“462
447
fig. 1 scheme of signaling pathways implicated in apoptosis
(pcd type i) of cardiac myocytes. depending on the stimuli
apoptosis may be initiated extrinsically via the engagement of
cell surface death receptors or intrinsically via the mitochondrial
pathway. the receptor-mediated death pathway is initiated by
binding of a death ligand (e.g., cd95l/fasl) to its cognate
receptor (e.g., cd95/fas) in the plasma membrane. the cyto-
plasmic tail of the death receptor then engages death adaptor
molecules (e.g., fadd), resulting in the recruitment and
activation of procaspase 8. caspase 8 activates downstream
effector caspases such as caspase 3, resulting in the execution of
apoptosis. caspase 8 also activates bid, thereby linking the two
death pathways. the mitochondrial death pathway is regulated by
the bcl-2 family of proteins. cellular stresses are communicated
to the mitochondria by pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family members (e.g.,
bid, bax), leading to the release of pro-apoptotic molecules (e.g.,
cytochrome c, endog, aif, smac/diablo) from the mito-
chondrial
intermembrane space into the cytosol where they
initiate the apoptotic cascade. anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family
members (e.g., bcl-2 and bcl-xl) oppose these actions
[9, 107]. the first model describes a non-specific mode
of release in which opening of the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (mptp) leads to the
swelling of mitochondria due to the osmotic influx of
water into the protein- and metabolite-dense mitochon-
drial matrix. the highly convoluted inner mitochondrial
membrane is able to expand while the outer mitochon-
drial membrane ruptures, releasing cytochrome c into
the cytosol. the second model describes specific modes
of release, where bcl-2 family proteins form pores
either directly via oligomerization, regulate the pore
size of pre-existing pores, or indirectly by causing
membrane instability which gives rise to lipidic pores.
in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to apaf1 (apo-
ptotic protease activating factor 1) and in the presence
of datp, procaspase 9 is recruited to the complex,
now termed the apoptosome, leading to the activation
of procaspase 9 [1, 143]. activated caspase 9 can
activate downstream effector caspases, and thus deter-
mine the cell to death. cytochrome c-dependent
activation of caspase 9 is supported by smac/diablo
which is likewise released from the mitochondrial
intermembrane space and removes the anti-apoptotic
activity of iaps (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) [44,
182]. in addition, mitochondria release endonuclease

cate to the nucleus and promote chromatin condensa-
tion and large-scale dna fragmentation [156].
the mitochondrial death pathway appears to play
an important role in the execution of apoptosis in
cardiac myocytes [35, 53, 58]. caspase-dependent cy-
tochrome c release has been reported in isolated chick
cardiac myocytes subjected to simulated i/r [137] and
several parameters of mitochondria-mediated apopto-
sis were demonstrated during myocardial i/r injury in
vivo [109] and ex vivo [26]. furthermore, preservation
of mitochondrial integrity via inhibition of the mptp
[13, 63] or counterbalancing of pro-apoptotic bcl-2
protein activity [17, 59] proved cardioprotective in i/r
injury.
death signaling at the mitochondria
mitochondria form a point of convergence and inte-
gration of both survival and death signaling pathways.
mitochondria communicate death signals between mito-
chondria and to other organelles such as the sarco/
endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. the pro-death
capabilities of the mitochondrion are controlled by three
main factors: mptp activity, increased reactive oxygen
species (ros) production, and impaired calcium ho-
meostasis.
mitochondrial permeability transition
the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp)
participates in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death
[85]. upon activation of the mptp, the inner mito-
chondrial membrane becomes permeable to solutes of
up to 1.5 kda, causing the collapse of mitochondrial
membrane potential. it is generally thought that a
minimal mptp is composed of vdac (voltage depen-
dent anion channel in the outer mitochondrial mem-
brane), ant (adenine nucleotide translocator in the
inner mitochondrial membrane) and cyclophilin d
(a prolyl isomerase located in the matrix) [34]. the
physiological roles of vdac and the ant are in the
delivery of atp from the mitochondrial matrix to
the cytosol, whereas the role of cyclophilin d in the
mitochondrial matrix is not understood. however,
these proteins are altered into forming the mptp
under pathophysiological conditions of high mito-
chondrial matrix calcium levels and/or enhanced oxi-
dative stress.
interestingly, mptp activation has been shown to
occur upstream of bax-mediated cytochrome c release
[39, 134]. mptp activation may also amplify any cel-
lular energetic crisis, as mitochondria become atp
consumers, via atp hydrolysis and reverse proton
pumping by h+-atpase [102]. in the heart, the mptp
has been implicated as an important factor mediating
i/r injury [186]. both cyclosporin a (csa) and sangli-
fehrin-a, inhibitors of the mptp, have been shown to
prevent cardiac myocyte death caused by i/r in perfused
hearts [13, 66]. recently, in vivo studies in cyclophilin
d-null mice have confirmed the mptp, or at least cy-
clophilin d, as a mediator of i/r injury in the heart [8].
mitochondrial ros generation
intimately linked to the mitochondrial role in pcd is
their capability to generate ros. in the cardiac
myocyte it has been estimated that from 0.2 [163] to
2% [14] of o2 that is normally reduced to h2o is
converted to the superoxide anion (o 
2 ), the upstream
source of most ros. o 
2 production occurs by the
transfer of electrons onto o2 at complex i [178] and
the semiquinone radical of complex iii of
the
mitochondrial electron transport chain [177].
during i/r injury the return of oxygen to ischemic
tissues is accompanied by an increased production of
ros. studies on whole hearts and isolated cells have
shown that a burst of ros generation occurs during
the first minutes after hypoxic and ischemic tissues are
reoxygenated [204], due to the reactivation of mito-
chondrial respiration [3]. ros generation results in
tissue lipid and protein oxidation [101, 181]. antioxi-
dant scavenging of ros blunts or eliminates i/r injury
in vivo and in vitro [22, 101] and enhanced catalase
expression via adenoviral gene transfer decreased
injury [203], demonstrating that ros play a causative
role in myocardial i/r injury.
mitochondrial calcium handling
the cardiac myocyte requires an efficient supply and
delivery of atp from the mitochondria to perform
work and maintain ion homeostasis. calcium (ca2+),
which is stored in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (s/
er, specialized endoplasmic reticulum of muscle
cells), serves as a second messenger to couple mito-
chondrial atp production to demand: ca2+-release
during the action potential stimulates both actino-
myosin atpase activity (contraction) and mitochon-
drial oxidative phosphorylation [45] by activation of
the tricarboxylic acid cycle [142]. during the action
potential, a small amount of ca2+ enters the cardiac
myocyte through l-type channels in the plasma
membrane, triggering the large-scale release of sarco-
plasmic reticulum ca2+ stores into the cytosol [10]. the
atp-dependent sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium

atpase (serca) then pumps ca2+ from the cytosol
back into the s/er during the relaxation phase.
decreased atp production due to mitochondrial
dysfunction during i/r results in decreased serca
less ca2+ is pumped back into the s/er,
activity:
leading to increased cytosolic ca2+ levels. the in-
creased cytosolic ca2+ levels may activate the ca2+-
dependent calpain protease, which can activate the
pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family member bid [26]. further-
more, elevated cytosolic ca2+ levels have been sug-
gested to lead to mitochondrial ca2+ overload, which
in turn would be causative in mptp opening and
subsequent activation of apoptosis [7, 62]. however, a
recent study has shown that during simulated i/r in
isolated adult cardiac myocytes, mitochondrial ca2+
overload was found to be the consequence, rather than
cause, of mptp activation [86], implicating upstream
events leading to mitochondrial dysfunction as the
important determinants in i/r injury.
regulation of mitochondrial integrity
by bcl-2 family members
at the level of the single mitochondrion, both mptp
activity and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins from
the mitochondrial intermembrane space are regulated
by two opposing classes of the bcl-2 (b-cell leukemia/
lymphoma 2) family of death-regulating proteins
(fig. 1). members of the bcl-2 protein family have
either anti- or pro-apoptotic functions [33, 140].
cellular stresses leading to the execution of cell
death pathways are perceived by bcl-2 family pro-
teins and communicated to the mitochondria by
regulated targeting of these proteins to the outer
mitochondrial membrane where they modulate the
release of pro-apoptotic molecules such as cyto-
chrome c through interaction with other bcl-2 family
proteins. bcl-2 family proteins exert different activ-
ities as a function of their intracellular localization.
bcl-2 family members have also been shown to target
membranes of the s/er, and the nuclear envelope
where they exert additional/alternate pro- or anti-
apoptotic functions in part by regulating organelle
calcium content and trafficking events [16, 110].
a common characteristic for all bcl-2 family
members is the presence of at least one, and up to
four, bcl-2 homology (bh) domains which allow for
the formation of homo- or heterodimers between bcl-2
proteins [82, 126]. the majority of bcl-2 proteins
furthermore possess a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic
transmembrane (tm) domain for targeting to intra-
cellular membranes, with the exception of some bh3-
only proteins.
anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members
the anti-apoptotic members, including bcl-2 and bcl-xl,
posses four bcl-2 homology domains (bh1–bh4) and
potently inhibit apoptosis in various settings through
the sequestration of pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family mem-
bers via heterodimerization [4]. bcl-2 is always associ-
ated with intracellular membranes (i.e., the outer
mitochondrial membrane, s/er and nuclear envelope)
[95]. bcl-xl is found in association with intracellular
membranes and in addition exists in a soluble form in
the cytosol which translocates to the mitochondria
during apoptosis [189]. at the mitochondria both bcl-2
and bcl-xl have also been shown to stabilize the
mptp and block the release of mitochondrial apopto-
genic factors following cell death stimuli [168]. at the
s/er, bcl-2 and bcl-xl increase the permeability of
the s/er to calcium, minimizing the ca2+ signaling
component of apoptosis [190].
anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins have potent cardio-
protective effects. both bcl-2 and bcl-xl have been
shown to protect against i/r injury ex vivo and in vivo
[17, 70, 71]. gene transfer of bcl-xl reduced cardiac
cell apoptosis following cold preservation and warm
reperfusion of rat cardiac transplants [70]. further-
more, elevated bcl-2 protein levels were reported to
coincide with the onset of protection during myocar-
dial stunning [42].
pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family members
bh3-only
the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 members either contain three
bcl-2 homology domains (bh1–bh3; e.g., bax and
bak) or a single bh3 domain (
; e.g., bid
and bnip3). bax and bid reside largely in the cytosol
(or loosely bound to the mitochondria) and translocate
to the mitochondria following a pro-death stimulus [56,
189]. once activated, bax (bcl-2 associated x protein)
undergoes a conformational change, allowing for its c-
terminal end to be inserted into the mitochondrial
outer membrane [51, 121]. membrane insertion is
followed by oligomerization, an event thought to
precede cytochrome c release [148, 160]. it has been
proposed that bax, together with activated bid, forms
channels directly via its oligomerization [107], regu-
lates the pore size of the vdac to allow cytochrome c
translocation [160], or causes membrane instability to
open lipidic channels [49].
bh3-only
the
family member bid (bcl-2 interacting
domain) lies within the extrinsic death receptor pathway,
450
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445–462
and upon its activation serves to bridge the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways. following tnf-a or fas ligand
treatment, bid is cleaved by caspase 8 to give rise to
the c-terminal product tbid (truncated bid), which is
myristoylated and translocates to the mitochondria
[202]. during reperfusion, bid may also be activated by
calpain cleavage [26]. bid has been proposed to directly
participate in the mitochondrial outer membrane per-
meabilization event [199], as well as to amplify the
pro-apoptotic signaling of bax either through direct
interaction with bax/bak [148, 185], or through scav-
enging of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and bcl-xl, which oppose
bax activity [27, 183]. during i/r injury bid and bax
play crucial roles in the commitment to cell death, as
demonstrated in both bid [129] and bax [67] knockout
mice, where infarct following i/r in the isolated heart
was reduced by around 63 and 51%, respectively.
bh3-only
bnip3 (bcl-2/adenovirus e1b 19 kda interacting
protein) is another member of the
bcl-2
subfamily which has been described to induce apopto-
tic [96], necrotic [180], and autophagic [38, 81] cell
death. bnip3 possesses a c-terminal transmembrane
(tm) domain which is required for its pro-apoptotic
function, including targeting to the mitochondria [25,
196]. elevated bnip3 protein levels have been ob-
served in vivo in an animal model of chronic heart
failure [141]. moreover, bnip3 expression has been
reported to be upregulated in neonatal myocytes
subjected to hypoxia, resulting in mitochondrial dys-
function and subsequent cell death [18, 96, 141].
recently, our lab has shown that bnip3 contributes
to i/r injury in the ex vivo heart via disruption of
mitochondrial integrity, leading to enhanced superox-
ide production and the release of pro-apoptotic factors
such as cytochrome c and aif [64].
autophagy—at the interface between death
and survival
self-digestion
),
autophagy (greek for:
is under
normal conditions a process for the turnover and
recycling of long-lived macromolecules and organelles
via the lysosomal degradative pathway,
involved in
maintaining cellular homeostasis, differentiation, and
tissue remodeling. paradoxically, under pathophysio-
logical conditions, autophagy may serve a protective
role or contribute to cell damage. for example,
nutrient depletion classically induces autophagy in
order to provide amino acids for the synthesis of
essential proteins, thus prolonging cell survival [90].
moreover, autophagy may up to a certain threshold
counteract apoptotic stimuli (pcd type i) [15, 138].
other studies, however, have shown that autophagy
can act as an alternative form of programmed cell
death, termed pcd type ii [23, 32, 179]. interestingly,
autophagy shares common molecular regulators with
apoptosis, including the anti-apoptotic members of the
bcl-2 family proteins [105, 128, 159],
indicating a
probable crosstalk between the two pathways.
molecular mechanism of autophagy
three main pathways lead to the lysosome via
autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and
chaperone-mediated autophagy [36, 90]. during chap-
erone-mediated autophagy, proteins are delivered to
the lysosome via the chaperone hsc73 (heat shock
cognate protein 73) [37]. microautophagy describes
the process whereby proteins are locally taken up by
the lysosome. macroautophagy (hereafter referred to
as autophagy), the most active form of autophagy, is a
specific mode of autophagy in which isolation mem-
branes envelope a portion of the cytosol, containing
non-specific cytosolic components, selectively targeted
toxic protein aggregates [139], intracellular pathogens
[60], or organelles such as mitochondria [135, 191]. the
autophagosomes undergo a series of maturation steps
via fusion with endosomal vesicles and are then
delivered to the lysosome, forming the autophagolyso-
some, for subsequent degradation of their contents by
lysosomal proteases (fig. 2).
autophagosome formation
the autophagic process is initiated by the formation of
an isolation membrane (or phagophore), possibly
derived from the s/er [75], which engulfs portions of
the cytoplasm to generate a closed, double-membrane
structure, the autophagosome. many of the genes
identified to participate in autophagy (atg) are
designated numerically (e.g., atg7). two ubiquitin-
like conjugation systems which are well conserved
among eukaryotes are required for the formation of
the autophagosome. one involves the attachment of
atg12 to atg5 and the other the conjugation of phos-
phatidylethanolamine to lc3/atg8 (fig. 2).
atg12 is a modifier protein which is irreversibly
conjugated to atg5, independent of autophagy induc-
tion [116]. atg7 (an ubiquitin-activating e1-like en-
zyme) activates atg12 in an atp-dependent manner,
by binding to its carboxy-terminal glycine. subsequent-
ly, the carboxy-terminal glycine of atg12 is transferred
to atg10 (an ubiquitin-conjugation e2-like enzyme).
atg10 in turn activates the conjugation of atg12
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445–462
451
fig. 2 macroautophagy is a three-step process. macroautophagy
first involves the sequestration of a region of the cytosol, containing
proteins and/or organelles, which are engulfed by a newly formed
double-membrane organelle, the autophagosome. to accomplish
degradation of the autophagosome and its cargo (filled circle), the
autophagosome matures via fusion with endosomal vesicles and,
subsequently, with the acidic lysosome, generating the autopha-
golysosome. within the autophagolysosome, lysosomal proteases
(filled triangle) degrade the inner autophagosomal membrane and
cargo. two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems during autophago-
some formation. atg12 and lc3/atg8 are ubiquitin-like proteins
which during autophagosome formation are conjugated to atg5
and pe, respectively. atg12 is activated and bound by e1-like
atg7, transferred to e2-like atg10, and conjugated to atg5.
homodimers of atg16 bind a pair of atg12–atg5 conjugates and
this complex transiently associates with the forming autophagoso-
mal membrane. the membrane-bound atg12–atg5
atg16 com-
plex is a prerequisite for the recruitment of lc3-ii, which is the
product of the second ubiquitin-like conjugation. initially, the
cysteine protease atg4 removes the c-terminal arginine residue of
cytosolic lc3, generating lc3-i with a revealed glycine residue.
lc3-i is then activated by e1-like atg7, transferred to e2-like
atg3, and conjugated to pe. the resulting lc3-ii is recruited into
the forming autophagosomal membrane. after completion of
autophagosomes formation, a second cleavage by atg4 results in
some removal of pe from lc3-ii, reverting it back into lc3-i
which is released from the membrane. the remaining membrane-
attached lc3-ii is degraded by lysosomal proteases
carboxy-terminal glycine to atg5 lysine 130. atg16
dimerizes and forms a complex with a pair of atg12–
atg5 and this complex evenly associates with the
crescent-shaped phagophore. curvature is thought to
be introduced via subsequent asymmetrical redistribu-
tion of the atg12–atg5
atg16 complex mainly to the
convex surface of the phagophore. upon completion
of autophagosome formation, atg12–atg5
atg16 com-
plexes dissociate from the membrane [50] and are not
present in the mature autophagosome. atg12–atg5
conjugation is indispensable for the involvement of
atg5 in the elongation of the initial phagophore [117].
the phagophore into the
autophagosome requires the cooperation of microtu-
the development of
bule-associated protein light chain 3 (lc3/atg8) [170].
lc3 is synthesized as a cytosolic full-length precursor
protein which is converted into lc3-i via cleavage by
the cysteine protease atg4, exposing its carboxy-
terminal glycine residue [89]. the glycine residue is
then activated by atg7 (e1-like) in an atp-dependent
manner, transferred to atg3 (e2-like), and finally
conjugated to the phospholipid phosphatidylethanol-
amine (pe) through an amide bond [111]. lc3-pe (or
lc3-ii) is then recruited to the autophagosomal mem-
brane in an atg5-dependent manner [117], a process
that is required for the execution of autophagy [89]. a
lysine-130-arginine (k130r) mutation of atg5 prevents

targeting of atg5 [115, 136]. importantly, atg5(k130r)
is unable to recruit lc3 and results in failed phag-
ophore maturation. as opposed to atg12–atg5, lc3-ii
is present both in the early phagophores and mature
autophagosomes where it ultimately is degraded by
lysosomal proteases [88]. atg4 can deconjugate pe
from lc3-ii located in the outer autophagosomal
membrane, converting it back to cytoplasmic lc3-i
[78], although most lc3-ii is degraded by the lysosome
[169]. the carboxy-terminal end of lc3 serves as an
interface with autophagosomal membranes, while the
amino-terminal end is required for binding to tubulin
and microtubules [94].
the characterization of gfp-lc3 is a driving force
in the autophagy field as it functions as a unique and
specific indicator for autophagosomal vesicles (avs)
in live cells (cell culture and in vivo), as assessed by
fluorescence microscopy and western blotting [77].
currently, a demonstration of either punctate gfp-
lc3-ii labeled avs by fluorescence imaging, or lc3-
ii detection by western blotting, are the standard
means for detecting changes in autophagic activity.
however,
to note that lysosomal
degradation of lc3-ii varies according to cell type
[118]. moreover, increased levels of avs can represent
impairment in the fusion with lysosomes rather than an
upregulation in autophagic activity. as such, common-
ly reported steady-state lc3-ii concentration (pres-
ence of avs) provides an incomplete view of the
autophagic process: increased avs may indicate either
enhanced autophagy, reduced degradation of avs, or
a combination of both.
it is important
autophagosome maturation
following the completion of autophagic sequestration,
the autophagosome undergoes a series of maturation
steps prior to its fusion with the lysosome. during the
multi-step maturation process, autophagosomes fuse
with endosomal vesicles and protease-containing late
endosomal compartments and finally, lysosomes [52].
these fusion events are mediated in part by a family
of rab gtpases, known mediators of vesicular traf-
ficking, whose functions include vesicle formation,
motility, and tethering to their target compartment
[201]. upon membrane fusion, rab-bound gtp is
hydrolyzed to gdp, and inactive rab-gdp is bound
by a rab gdp-dissociation inhibitor (rabgdi), remov-
ing rab to its original membrane compartment. rab7 is
a key component in the regulation of autophagosomal
maturation: overexpression of a dominant negative
mutant of rab7 has been shown to inhibit fusion
between autophagosomes and the late endosome/lyso-
somal compartment [61, 74]. lysosomal receptor pro-
teins lamp1 and lamp2 are involved in rab7-mediated
fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes as rnai
knockdown of either protein results in retarded recruit-
ment of rab7 to autophagosomal membranes [74], and
the accumulation of autophagosomes [15].
in addition, the cytoskeleton also regulates auto-
phagosome formation as well as endosomal and
lysosomal trafficking [5]. pharmacologic inhibition of
microtubules with nocodazole blocks fusion between
autophagosomes and lysosomes, demonstrating its role
in autophagosome formation and delivery [92].
degradation within the autophagolysosome
the autophagosome acquires the milieu and enzymes
necessary for the degradation of its cargo through
fusion with the lysosome. the lysosome is a mem-
brane-bound organelle which contains a cocktail of
predominantly hydrolytic enzymes that are maximally
active at low ph (e.g., cathepsins b and d which
degrade proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and polysacchar-
ides). acidification of the lysosomal lumen is accom-
plished by the vacuolar h+-atpase (v-atpase), which
hydrolyses cytosolic atp to translocate h+ into the
lysosomal lumen [167]. lysosomal transport proteins
such as cystinosin are thought to mediate the recycling
of degraded products (amino acids, sugars, and nu-
cleotides) from the lysosome back to the cytosol [188],
thereby completing the catabolic process.
regulation of autophagy
two pathways, which are conserved among eukary-
otes, are involved in regulating autophagic activity at
the level of induction: one involves class i phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-k), which suppresses auto-
phagy, and the other involves class iii pi3-k leading to
activation of autophagy (fig. 3).
negative regulation of autophagy
autophagy is suppressed by the class i pi3-k/akt
pathway [130], which is involved in anabolic metabo-
lism [24, 65]. within this pathway mtor (mammalian
target of rapamycin) is a central downstream effector
kinase which mediates the cellular response to nutrients,
amino acids and mitogens [150]. in the presence of
amino acids and growth factors, mtor activates the
p70s6 kinase (p70s6k), which phosphorylates the
ribosomal protein s6, resulting in the upregulation of
the translational machinery. in addition, mtor phos-
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445–462
453
fig. 3 regulation of autophagy. (1) induction of autophagy
requires activity of beclin1 and its interacting partner, class iii
pi3-k (vps34), resulting in the generation of pi3-p; and it is
negatively regulated by class i pi3-k through mtor. (2)
formation of the phagophore requires conjugation of atg12 to
lysine 130 of atg5 as a prerequisite for recruiting lc3-ii. (3)
sequestration of cytoplasmic material may be non-specific or
selective; mechanisms that may govern selectivity are incom-
pletely understood. (4) degradation of the autophagosome and
its cargo is accomplished after sequential fusion events with
endosomes and finally lysosomes. transport and fusion events
are mediated by rab gtpases, with rab7 being a major player
in autophagy. beclin1-vps34 activity might further be involved
in lysosomal protein sorting (not shown)
phorylates and thereby deactivates the initiation factor
4e-bp1 (4e binding protein). deactivated 4e-bp1 then
dissociates from the initiation factor eif4e, which is the
rate-limiting step in protein synthesis. inhibiting mtor
activity with the immunosuppressant rapamycin [12]
increases the catabolic process of autophagy, even in
the presence of nutrients [123]. the negative control of
mtor over autophagy is a generally accepted phe-
nomenon [162]; however, the underlying mechanism is
largely unknown.
positive regulation of autophagy
beclin1/atg6, the first mammalian protein described to
mediate autophagy [104], is a coiled-coil, myosin-like
bcl-2-interacting protein which engages class iii pi3-k/
vps34 to positively regulate autophagy [83, 200].
beclin1 has been shown to colocalize with the s/er,
mitochondria [106], and golgi [83]. typically all beclin1
forms a complex with vps34, whereas õ50% of vps34
is not associated with beclin1 [83]. the specific product
of vps34, phosphatidylinositol 3-phospate (pi3-p), is a
lipid second messenger which mediates the formation
of autophagosomes [130, 153]. furthermore, the yeast
homologs of beclin1 and vps34 have been shown to
mediate intracellular vesicle trafficking, including endo-
somes and transport of lysosomal proteases from the
golgi to the lysosome [84, 124]. however, in mamma-
lian cells the role of beclin1-vps34 in trafficking and
protein sorting remains controversial [83, 124, 144].
insulin is well understood to activate the akt/pkb-
mtor pathway, which suppresses autophagy. recent-
ly, however, insulin was shown to stimulate autophagic
degradation of mutant polyglutamine huntingtin pro-
teins in hela cells [193]. apparently, irs2, through a
pathway independent of akt activation, can activate
the beclin1-vps34 to engage in autophagic activity.
this highlights our still limited understanding of the
complexity of autophagic signaling.
crosstalk of autophagy and apoptosis: bcl-2 family
members
the interplay between autophagic and apoptotic path-
ways is emerging as a crucial decision-making process
in determining the initiation of programmed cell
death.
autophagy and the extrinsic pathway
a recent study found that atg5 couples ifn-gamma
activated death to the autophagic death and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways via the interaction with fadd,
and possibly caspase 8 [136]. interestingly, atg5 was
first described as apoptosis specific protein (asp) [54],
and was found to be upregulated in neurons during
apoptosis activated by proteasomal inhibition [112].
454
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445â€“462
furthermore, caspase 8, unrelated to its pro-apo-
ptotic function, may function to suppress autophagic
cell death. treatment of l929 cells with zvad induces
programmed cell death which is blocked by rnai
knockdown of autophagic proteins [197]. a key lethal
event in zvad-activated autophagic cell death is the
targeted autophagic degradation of catalase, resulting
in an increase in ros levels [198]. importantly, this
study demonstrated that catalase degradation was
specific to zvad-activated autophagy, and did not
occur under starvation conditions.
anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members
beclin1 was initially identified as a bcl-2 interacting
protein using a yeast two-hybrid screen [105]. subse-
quently,
it was discovered that the bcl-2 binding
domain of beclin1 serves as a point of crosstalk
between the autophagic and apoptotic pathways, at
the level of autophagy induction. interestingly,
it
seems that only anti- but not pro-apoptotic bcl-2
family members can interact with this domain [104].
bcl-2 downregulation has been shown to increase
autophagy in hl-60 cells [145], while overexpression
of bcl-2 or bcl-xl increased the autophagic cell death
response to etoposide treatment in mef cells [159].
recently, bcl-2 was shown to suppress starvation-
induced autophagy, specifically when targeted to the
er [128]. clearly, the nature of the relationship is not
yet fully understood and merits further investigation. it
is likely that the regulation of autophagy by bcl-2 is a
function of both cell type and stimulus.
pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family members
the bh3-only proteins bax, bid and bnip3 also
constitute a point of crosstalk between the apoptotic
and autophagic pathways. following staurosporine
treatment of fibroblasts, bax has been shown to localize
to the lysosome, resulting in the release of cathepsin d
[79]. furthermore,
in t-lymphocytes, bax can be
activated by cathepsin d in response to staurosporine
[11], indicating a potential lethal amplification loop.
similarly, bid can be activated by lysosomal cathep-
sin proteases which are released into the cytosol during
some forms of pcd [30, 165]. moreover, bid itself has
recently been shown to cause destabilization of lyso-
somes and release of cathepsin b [57, 187], forming an
amplification event for mitochondrial apoptosis. in
mcf-7 cells exposed to camptothecin, rnai silencing
of bid inhibited apoptosis and enhanced autophagic
cell death, indicating that bid functions as a
switch
between the different modes of pcd [98].
upregulation of bnip3 has been shown to correlate
with ceramide-induced accumulation of autophago-
somes in malignant glioma cells [38]. similarly, arsenic
trioxide-induced pcd correlated with elevated levels
of bnip3 and enhanced presence of autophagosomal
structures [81]. interestingly, in these studies expres-
sion of the dominant-negative transmembrane domain
deletion mutant of bnip3 prevented the observed
changes in autophagy, while overexpression of bnip3
was sufficient to induce increased steady-state levels of
autophagosomes in the absence of ceramide or arsenic
trioxide. the authors concluded that ceramide- and
arsenic trioxide-induced bnip3-mediated pcd is auto-
phagic; however, a causative role of autophagy in cell
death was not established.
we recently determined that bnip3 is a key mediator
of mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in the ex
vivo heart following ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) [64].
using a model of simulated i/r and overexpression of
bnip3 in hl-1 cardiac myocytes [31], we determined
that bnip3-mediated upregulation of autophagic activ-
ity constituted a protective response against bnip3
death signalling: overexpression of atg5 decreased
bnip3-activated cell death and the dominant negative
atg5k130r enhanced bnip3-activated cell death.
furthermore, we found that bnip3-induced autopha-
gosomes often contained fragmented mitochondria,
demonstrating a potentially powerful protective role of
autophagy in the cell,
in the removal of dangerous
mitochondria. the mptp has been shown to signal the
elimination of malfunctioning mitochondria by autoph-
agy (mitophagy): in hepatocytes, mitochondria which
had undergone the permeability transition were re-
moved by lysosomal degradation [47]. furthermore,
rapamycin-enhanced autophagic activity was recently
shown to decrease mitochondrial content in a neuronal
cell
line, and conversely 3-methyladenine (3-ma)
(inhibitor of vps34) increased sensitivity to apoptotic
stimuli. these results indicate that autophagic clearance
of mitochondria increased the resistance to apoptotic
stimuli, either by reducing the amount of cytochrome c
that could be released into the cytosol, or by eliminat-
ing the most susceptible mitochondria [138].
autophagy in the heart
normal processes
it is well understood that autophagy is a vital process in
the heart, presumably participating in the removal of
dysfunctional cytosolic components, and serving as a
catabolic energy source during times of starvation. for
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445–462

fig. 4 autophagic flux under nutrient deprivation. gfp-lc3
transfected hl-1 cells were incubated in low nutrient krebs–
henseleit (kh) solution, with or without the presence of the
lysosomal inhibitor cocktail (i) consisting of bafilomycin a1 (100
nm, vacuolar h+-atpase inhibitor) to inhibit autophagosome-
lysosome fusion [194], and e64d (5 mg/ml, inhibitor of cysteine
proteases, including cathepsin b), and pepstatin a methyl ester
(5 mg/ml, cathepsin d inhibitor) to inhibit lysosomal protease
activity. under conditions of high autophagic activity, low levels
of autophagosomes are present. in the presence of lysosomal
inhibitors, the fusion with, and degradation of autophagosome by
the lysosome is blocked. this results in an increase in the number
of autophagosomes, proportionate to the level of autophagic flux
example, autophagy in cardiac myocytes has been
suggested to provide a necessary source of energy
between birth and suckling [97], and in a gfp-lc3
transgenic mouse, cardiac myocytes from starved ani-
mals displayed high numbers of autophagosomes, some
of which contained mitochondria [118]. recently it was
shown that danon disease-related cardiomyopathy,
which is caused by decreased levels of lamp2 [68,
146], is characterized by extensive accumulation of non-
degraded autophagosomal vacuoles in cardiac myocytes
which then interfere with contractile function [166].
the fight against aging
old
impaired autophagy may play a causative role in
cardiac disease. autophagy is responsible for mito-
chondrial turnover [173], and the incomplete autopha-
gic turnover of
mitochondria may be the source
of lipofuscin, a toxic waste product which builds up
during the lifespan [19]. mitochondria are the main
site of atp generation, as well as the main site of ros
production. accumulation of intracellular damage due
to ros production by the mitochondria may be a
causative factor in aging [127]. sites of damage include
mtdna, establishing a vicious cycle, where mutations
to components of
the etc enhance basal ros
production and decrease atp production. long-term
inhibition of autophagy in neonate cardiac myocytes
results in increased levels of basal cell death, sensitizes
to hyperoxic cell death and a build-up of defective
mitochondria [172]. in vivo, a decline in the
house-
hold cleaning
capabilities may sensitize cells to
ischemic injury during aging [76].
contribution to pathologies
protective role in the heart
importantly, active autophagy may serve as a protec-
tive response to myocardial i/r injury, as increased
prevalence of autophagosomes has been documented
in response to sub-lethal ischemia in the perfused heart
[41]. moreover, it was recently reported that in an in
vivo model of myocardial stunning the onset of
protection correlated with increased beclin1 expres-
sion [195]. however, the nature of its protective effect
in vivo, if any, remains unknown.
in addition to its putative role in removing dysfunc-
tional mitochondria, autophagy may exert protective
effects by removing protein aggregates. in the neuron,
autophagy is now understood to be a major player in
preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggre-
gates, which are causative in neurodegeneration [93,
139, 158]. in the heart, aggregation of cytosolic proteins
456
cardiovasc drugs ther (2006) 20: 445–462
does occur [28] and may be pathogenic [108]. further-
more, the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(ups), is decreased during i/r [133], possibly due to
oxidative stress [73]. studies are needed to determine
whether autophagy may compensate for decreased
ups activity in the heart.
lethal role in the heart
cell
impaired autophagy may play a role in the hyper-
trophic response following ischemic injury. as cardiac
myocytes are terminally differentiated,
loss
after i/r necessitates that remaining myocytes grow
in size to try to maintain the same cardiac output, a
process termed hypertrophy. during this anabolic pro-
cess, autophagy has been reported to be decreased
[131]. as autophagy serves a vital role in the heart,
decreased activity during hypertrophy may result in
the buildup of toxic protein aggregates and malfunc-
tioning mitochondria, which could play a role in the
progression from compensated hypertrophy to heart
failure (hf).
many studies have suggested that autophagic cell
death (pcd type ii) occurs in the failing heart.
autophagosomes are widely reported to be increased
in heart disease [91, 114, 147, 161], and in response to
myocardial hibernation [48] and diphtheria toxin-
activated myocardial cell death [2]. furthermore,
disruption of the autophagic pathway may contribute
to myocardial cell death under conditions where
lysosomal integrity is lost and lysosomal proteases are
released into the cytosol [40].
however, these conclusions are based on correlative
data, mainly the presence of cathepsin in the cyto-
plasm and increase in autophagosomal structures. as
discussed above, the presence of avs does not offer
much insight into the role of autophagy. increased
numbers of avs may be due to an upregulation of
autophagy, or a block to the autophagic pathway [184]
furthermore, the presence of ubiquitin inclusions in
dying cells is neither convincing nor sufficiently specific
to infer autophagic cell death. although ubiquitin
staining can indicate the presence of defective autoph-
agy, even in the presence of an active proteasome [93],
these results can also describe a disruption to the ups
(most specific to short-lived proteins), which although
linked to the macroauto- phagy pathway, does neces-
sarily constitute a causative event.
to unravel the role of autophagy in the in vivo
heart, an essential starting point will be to make the
distinction between the detection of avs and active
autophagy. the presence of avs does not correlate
with autophagic activity: increased avs may indicate
enhanced autophagy or reduced degradation of avs.
rather, the rate of lc3-ii degradation, reflected by the
difference in levels of gfp-lc3-labeled avs in the
absence (steady-state avs) and presence (cumulative
avs) of lysosomal inhibitors is the most accurate means
indicator of autophagic activity [169], as demonstrated
in fig. 4.
establishing the mechanisms which promote the
anti-apoptotic effects of autophagy, and minimize au-
tophagic cell death may represent a potentially power-
ful tool against i/r-mediated cardiomyocyte cell death.
although cell models are useful for identifying partici-
pants and their roles in the control of autophagy over
cell death [64], ex vivo and in vivo models of autophagy
must be developed to determine the relevance to
heart. notably, rapamycin, which has been shown to
be protective in neurons [138], may not be acceptable
to treat the heart, as it inhibits hif1a, and thus would
block hif1a-mediated protective responses [21]. pro-
tein transduction, utilizing the protein transduction do-
main of hiv tat or antennapedia, has proven useful
for introducing protective proteins to the heart, in vivo
and ex vivo [59, 72], and will likely be a useful tool to
dissect the role of autophagy in the heart.
