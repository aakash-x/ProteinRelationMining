abstract
normal mitochondrial respiration is associated with a continuous production of superox-
ide and hydrogen peroxide, inevitably resulting in minor macromolecular damage. damaged
cellular components are not completely turned over by autophagy and other cellular repair
systems, leading to a progressive age-related accumulation of biological ‘‘garbage’’ material,
such as defective mitochondria, cytoplasmic protein aggregates and an intralysosomal unde-
gradable material, lipofuscin. these changes primarily aﬀect neurons, cardiac myocytes and
other long-lived postmitotic cells that neither dilute this ‘‘garbage’’ by mitotic activity, nor
are replaced by newly diﬀerentiated cells. defective mitochondria are insuﬃcient in atp pro-
duction and often generate increased amounts of reactive oxygen species, further enhancing
oxidative stress. lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes, in turn, poorly turn over mitochondria that
gradually leads to the overload of long-lived postmitotic cells with ‘‘garbage’’ material,
decreased adaptability and eventual cell death.

1. cell proliferation and manifestations of aging
aging (senescence) is associated with a progressive accumulation of deleterious
changes resulting in a gradual functional decline and an increasing probability of
disease and death. it has long been known that aging strikingly aﬀects so-called
postmitotic cells, such as cardiac myocytes and neurons, but is negligible in
actively proliferating cell populations, such as intestinal enterocytes, epidermal
squamous cells and bone marrow cells (strehler, 1977; comfort, 1979). although,
this statement is basically correct, the term ‘‘postmitotic cells’’ requires some clar-
iﬁcation. it is now established that the diﬀerence in the renewal rate between dif-
ferent cell types is not so strict as was hitherto believed. even such classical
postmitotic cells as neurons, cardiac myocytes and retinal pigment epithelial cells
have occasionally been shown to diﬀerentiate from stem cells in the adult organ-
ism, although, much less frequently than intestinal enterocytes or peripheral blood
cells (lledo et al., 2006; urbanek et al., 2006). on the other hand, terminally dif-
ferentiated cells within a rapidly proliferating population do not divide either and,
therefore, the term ‘‘postmitotic cells’’ is applicable for them as well. however,
the important feature of these cells is their frequent replacement and, for the ter-
minological accuracy, it is reasonable to call them ‘‘short-lived postmitotic cells’’,
while cardiac myocytes and neurons consequently should be termed ‘‘long-lived
postmitotic cells’’. although these cells can be substantially older than short-lived
cells,
it is probably not correct to always consider them as old as the whole
organism.
age-related changes progressively accumulate within long-lived postmitotic cells
primarily because of the fact that these cells are replaced rarely or not at all. in con-
trast, short-lived cells are continuously replaced as a result of stem cell diﬀerentiation
and repetitive division (leedham et al., 2005) that eﬃciently dilutes altered structures
and thus precludes any substantial accumulation of senescent changes (sheldrake,
1974; terman, 2001). although short-lived cells show negligible senescence, they
can easily senesce if their replacement is artiﬁcially suppressed, such as in long-term
conﬂuent cultures (terman and brunk, 1998) or in cultures at phase iii according to
a. terman et al. / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 471–482
473
hayﬂick that develops after repetitive divisions of non-transformed cells in vitro
(hayﬂick, 1965). these data support the idea that short-lived cells escape aging
primarily because of their frequent replacement but not because of some other
factors.
the role of long-lived postmitotic cells in aging is also supported by comparative
biological observations. aging has not been detected in hydra vulgaris, a primitive
animal all of whose cells are continuously replaced thanks to proliferation and dif-
ferentiation of interstitial stem cells (martinez, 1998). hydras belong to cnidaria
phylum, which is evolutionary earlier than other metazoans, known to possess
long-lived postmitotic cells and, therefore, senesce. it is not well understood if there
was any biological advantage in the appearance of long-lived postmitotic cells. it is
hypothesized that these cells provided for a number of evolutionary useful proper-
ties, such as a long-term memory, a function of long-lived neurons. these properties
apparently appeared more important for species survival than potential immortality
(terman and brunk, 2005b).
there is, however, one type of time-related changes that aﬀects rapidly prolif-
erating cell populations more readily than those with a low rate of cell division.
these changes are associated with non-lethal somatic mutations, which often
occur as a consequence of mitotic activity and which easily can be transferred
to the daughter cells but cannot be diluted (as any nuclear mutations) by mitotic
activity. well-known consequences of such accumulated multiple somatic muta-
tions are malignant neoplasms, which commonly arise from various epithelia,
connective tissue or bone marrow, but rarely occur in tissues with low mitotic
activity such as the myocardium (butany et al., 2005). malignant tumors, how-
ever, represent a separate age-related problem and are not discussed in this
review. here, we focus on the mechanisms underlying age-related alterations of
long-lived postmitotic cells.
2. the ‘‘garbage’’ accumulation theory of aging
postmitotic cells maintain themselves in good working condition owing to a
continuous turnover of macromolecules and organelles that includes degradation
of damaged structures and their replacement by newly synthesized ones. aging is
associated with the accumulation of damaged organelles, defective proteins and
intralysosomal undegradable material,
lipofuscin (terman and brunk, 2004b).
these functionally useless structures are commonly called biological ‘‘garbage’’,
or ‘‘waste’’, the accumulation of which suggests that the normal biological turn-
over process is less than perfect (terman, 2001; terman and brunk, 2004b). it
was earlier hypothesized that age-related changes mostly originate from imperfect
synthesis due to somatic mutations (burnet, 1973) or translational errors (orgel,
1973). these theories, however, never received any strong experimental support.
aged cells are still able to build up normal macromolecules and organelles,
and erroneously synthesized structures would not accumulate if they were totally
degraded. however, since the degradation process seems to be imperfect, both the
474
a. terman et al. / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 471–482
misbuilt structures and those suﬀered postsynthetic modiﬁcations accumulate in
postmitotic cells (terman, 2001; terman and brunk, 2004b). mitochondrial
dna (mtdna) mutations, as an exception, are perhaps the only type of changes
that can essentially contribute to postmitotic aging through synthetic errors (see
below).
cells possess a number of complementary systems that are responsible for
degradation of damaged macromolecules and organelles. many proteins, mainly
short-lived, are degraded by calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, calpains, and
multicatalytic proteinase complexes, proteasomes, which are active in both the
nucleus and the cytosol (sorimachi et al., 1997; wojcik and demartino, 2003).
most long-lived proteins, as well as other macromolecules, including proteasomes,
and all organelles are decomposed by lysosomes representing a universal intracel-
lular degradation machinery with several dozens hydrolytic enzymes that are active
at acidic ph (luzio et al., 2003; cuervo, 2004). intraysosomal degradation of the
cell’s own constituents is called autophagy (autophagocytosis). depending on how
intracellular material enters lysosomes, the process is classiﬁed as macroautophagy
(associated with the formation of a double membrane bounded autophagosomes
that fuse with lysosomes), microautophagy (in which material is delivered through
invaginations of the lysosomal membrane) and chaperone-mediated autophagy
(cuervo, 2004). macroautophagy provides for the degradation of virtually all types
of structures from macromolecules to large organelles, by microautophagy only
small organelles and macromolecules can be handled, while chaperone-mediated
autophagy is responsible for the degradation of speciﬁc proteins (cuervo, 2004).
mitochondrial proteins can be autonomously degraded by membrane-bound
aaa proteases (arnold and langer, 2002) and matrix lon proteases (bakala
et al., 2003).
although age-related alterations may reﬂect imperfect function of diﬀerent cat-
abolic pathways, autophagic insuﬃciency is probably the most important. this is
consistent with the involvement of lysosomes in the turnover of variety of cellular
structures and with the fact that material that has not been digested in the cyto-
sol can still be autophagocytosed and degraded by lysosomal enzymes. aged post-
mitotic
‘‘waste’’
material, reﬂecting insuﬃciency of autophagic sequestration (autophagosome for-
mation) and degradation, respectively. senescent mitochondria and protein aggre-
gates are typical examples of extralysosomal
‘‘waste’’, while lipofuscin is an
intralysosomal ‘‘waste’’. the amount of ‘‘waste’’ material progressively increases
with age at the expense of functionally eﬀective structures, ultimately resulting
in cell death.
cells accumulate both extralysosomal and intralysosomal
in support of the ‘‘garbage’’ accumulation theory of aging, it has been found that
prolonged inhibition of autophagy decreases the viability of growth-arrested (conﬂu-
ent) human ﬁbroblasts, but not that of dividing (sparse) cells, which dilute ‘‘garbage’’
through cell division (stroikin et al., 2005).

division and frequent replacement of diﬀerentiated cells, while in long-lived postmitotic cells (b), which are

asymmetrically, reproducing themselves and giving rise to diﬀerentiated cells that become mature after a
number of successive divisions (for simplicity, the number of divisions in the scheme is reduced). dark dots

‘‘garbage’’ material thus preventing its increase due to oxidative damage (denoted by unchanged number

accumulation. references are given in the text.
3. causes of cellular damage under normal conditions
an important question is what causes cellular damages that are not removable by
autophagy and other cellular turnover mechanisms. clearly, aging is a process that
starts early in life and gradually progresses over time. the fact that aging commences
in young and healthy individuals, although, for some time without dramatic delete-
rious eﬀects, suggests that it is a consequence of normal physiological processes. it is
known that normal mitochondrial respiration is associated with inevitable electron
leak, resulting in a nonstop formation of reactive oxygen species (ros), such as
superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical (halliwell and
gutteridge, 1999). denham harman was the ﬁrst one to emphasize the connection
between normal oxygen metabolism and the aging process. according to his free rad-
ical theory of aging, ros are responsible for continuous macromolecular damage,
the accumulation of which results in the alterations that are characteristic for aged
cells (harman, 1956). the validity of the free radical theory of aging has been exten-
sively supported (cadenas and davies, 2000; sohal et al., 2002; barja, 2004).
476
a. terman et al. / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 471–482
antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and
catalase, greatly diminish the amount of ros but do not fully eliminate them (halli-
well and gutteridge, 1999). macromolecular damages are also incompletely repaired
and, as mentioned above, damaged structures are only partially turned over. never-
theless, were the defense systems totally inactive, life would not be possible. this is
the case, for example, for homozygous mitochondrial superoxide dismutase knock-
out mice (copin et al., 2000). the fact that the defense systems eliminate the over-
whelming majority of injuries determines the relatively slow progress of aging (as
compared, for instance, with most diseases), which is in agreement with both the free
radical theory and the ‘‘garbage’’ accumulation theory.
oxidative stress seems to be the principal, but not the exclusive, reason of cellular
damage under normal conditions. glycation reactions and spontaneous macromo-
lecular instability were also reported responsible for cellular injuries contributing
to the aging process (lee and cerami, 1992; hipkiss, 2003).
4. mitochondrial alterations with age
diﬀerent compartments and structures within long-lived postmitotic cells experi-
ence damage unequally. mitochondria undergo the most dramatic age-related
changes, such as structural deterioration, enlargement, decreased respiration and
low atp production (ermini, 1976; beregi et al., 1988; terman et al., 2003). the
most apparent reason for the high vulnerability of mitochondria by age is their direct
exposure to self-generated ros (ozawa, 1997; cadenas and davies, 2000). another
probable reason is the properties of mtdna, which is not protected by histones and
also has a poorer repair capacity and higher proportion of expressed genes than
nuclear dna (ozawa, 1997). mutations of mtdna apparently account for only
part of mitochondrial alterations, while others are associated with direct damage
to mitochondrial macromolecular components. theoretically, mitochondrial dam-
age can also occur secondary to nuclear dna mutations, when all cellular mito-
chondria would be similarly aﬀected.
age-related mitochondrial alterations develop not only as a direct consequence of
injury to mitochondrial dna and proteins, but also due to ensuing changes in
mtdna replication, mitochondrial ﬁssion, fusion and turnover. many aged postmi-
totic cells develop homoplasmic mtdna point mutations and deletions, ﬁnally
resulting in the complete replacement of normal mitochondria with mutated ones
(ozawa, 1997; khrapko et al., 1999). it was deduced from these observations that
initially altered mtdna is clonally expanded, gradually substituting normal mtdna
(richter, 1995; ozawa, 1997). it was further speculated that deleted mtdna has a
replicative advantage because it is shorter than normal mtdna (richter, 1995;
ozawa, 1997). the clonal expansion hypothesis gained a strong support from obser-
vations on malignant cells, which accumulate homoplasmic mtdna mutations
despite the dilution of defective mitochondria through mitotic activity (hochhauser,
2000).
a. terman et al. / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 471–482
477
according to a more recent challenging hypothesis, mitochondria with mutated
dna accumulate because they escape autophagic degradation. this may occur
due to decreased respiration of defective mitochondria, making their membranes less
aﬀected by ros and, therefore,
less targeted for autophagy (de grey, 1997).
although, this hypothesis (called ‘‘sos’’, for ‘‘survival of the slowest’’) remains
unproved, it is consistent with the fact that mitochondrial autophagy can be selective
in some cases (sutovsky et al., 1999; kissova et al., 2004). it should be mentioned
that the clonal expansion and sos hypotheses do not mutually exclude each other,
and the mechanisms of age-related accumulation of mutated mitochondria suggested
by both theories can probably be combined.
there are good reasons to believe that mitochondrial damage may occur inde-
pendently of mtdna mutations. this follows, in particular, from the fact that
only one out of seven senescent cardiac myocytes harbored mtdna mutations
(khrapko et al., 1999). in cultured cardiac myocytes, small sized mitochondria
have been found more readily autophagocytosed than large ones, suggesting that
age-related accumulation of exceedingly enlarged (so-called ‘‘giant’’) mitochondria
may reﬂect their ineﬃcient autophagy (terman et al., 2003). apparently, autoph-
agy of small mitochondria is less energy consuming and, therefore, is easier than
that of large ones. initial mitochondrial enlargement may occur due to disturbed
ﬁssion, which,
in turn, may develop secondary to ros-induced damage. this
notion is consistent with the ﬁnding of decreased dna synthesis in large mito-
chondria (terman et al., 2003). a more detailed explanation of age-related accu-
mulation of
‘‘bottleneck’’ model,
symbolizing the limitation of mitochondrial turnover by mitochondrial size (ter-
man and brunk, 2005a).
‘‘giant’’ mitochondria is given in our
conceivably, age-related mitochondrial enlargement may be associated with
increased mitochondrial fusion, although, any evidence of such a possibility is
lacking. on the contrary, fusion events have been shown suppressed in senescent
mitochondria (jendrach et al., 2005). disturbances of the mitochondrial autono-
mous proteolytic machinery (represented by lon and aaa proteases) may also
contribute to mitochondrial aging. it has been demonstrated that at least lon
protease activity, indeed, decreases with age (bota et al., 2002). lipofuscin load-
ing of lysosomes in aged cells additionally complicates mitochondrial turnover
(see below).
modeling of homozygous mtdna polymerase gamma knockout mice provided
additional support for the key role of mitochondrial damage in aging (trifunovic
et al., 2004). these so-called mtdna mutator mice develop a variety of senescent-
like changes in diﬀerent organs, representing an artiﬁcial premature aging syndrome.
mitochondria of such mice show deﬁcient respiration, imitating the consequences of
mitochondrial damage in normal aging. no increase in ros production has been
detected in mtdna mutator mice (trifunovic et al., 2005). this ﬁnding, however,
does not oppose the free radical theory of aging, since the accumulation of unrepair-
able oxidative damage would occur even in constant, or even decreasing, level of oxi-
dative stress.

5. lysosomal changes with age: lipofuscin
lysosomes of long-lived postmitotic cells become more abundant and larger with
age, being loaded with a brown–yellow substance, lipofuscin (age pigment). lipofus-
cin is neither degraded by lysosomal enzymes, nor is exocytosed to any considerable
extent, which actually explains why intracellular lipofuscin content increases with
years (terman and brunk, 2004a). lipofuscin represents a complex polymeric mate-
rial, mainly composed of cross-linked protein and lipid residues and containing some
carbohydrates and traces of metals (terman and brunk, 2004a). accordingly, it
stains positively for lipids and sugars and is characterized by a high electron density.
in unstained specimens, lipofuscin granules are recognized by a bright, wide-spec-
trum autoﬂuorescence (brunk and terman, 2002b). all these properties, however,
are not absolutely speciﬁc for lipofuscin, but can be also a characteristic of an unde-
gradable intralysosomal pigment, ceroid, that occurs in a number of pathological
conditions, including lysosomal storage diseases, vitamin e deﬁciency, various intox-
ications, etc. attempts have been made to distinguish this disease-associated pigment
from age-related, or genuine, lipofuscin pigment based on a number of morpholog-
ical and physico-chemical characteristics (porta, 2002; seehafer and pearce, 2006).
not surprisingly, the properties of the undegradable intralysosomal pigment may
diverge in normal and pathological conditions, as well as in diﬀerent cell types
and diﬀerent pathological conditions, reﬂecting a complex and variable origin of
autophagocytosed or heterophagocytosed material. however,
the distinction
between lipofuscin and ceroid and between diﬀerent ceroid pigments based on a
complex battery of tests (seehafer and pearce, 2006) does not seem to have a high
reliability and practical value. in our opinion, lipofuscin and ceroid have the same
principal mechanisms of formation (see below) and the discrimination between the
two pigments is reasonable only from an etiological viewpoint.
lipofuscin can potentially form from any type of cellular material, but auto-
phagocytosed mitochondria seem to be its most important source. this is consistent
with the fact that mitochondrial atp-synthase subunit c is an invariable component
of lipofuscin or ceroid granules (elleder et al., 1997). autophagocytosed mitochon-
dria are rich in oxidatively modiﬁed membranes and matrix proteins, as well as cyto-
chrome c and other metalloproteins, being the source of low molecular weight iron,
catalyzing fenton reactions, i.e., formation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen per-
oxide (halliwell and gutteridge, 1999). the latter freely diﬀuses from functioning
mitochondria, and other places of formation, throughout the cell and is probably
also generated intralysosomally by autophagocytosed mitochondria. as a result,
autophagocytosed macromolecules undergo further oxidative modiﬁcations, form-
ing an undegradable pigment (brunk et al., 1992; terman and brunk, 2004a). this
process is relatively slow under normal conditions (lipofuscinogenesis) but can be
much accelerated in various pathologies (ceroidogenesis).
lipofuscin has long been considered an innocent hallmark of aging, but accumu-
lating evidences suggests the opposite. it has been recently demonstrated that lipo-
fuscin levels correlate with physiological, rather than with chronological age of
caenorhabditis elegans (gerstbrein et al., 2005). precise mechanisms behind negative

479
inﬂuence of lipofuscin accumulation remain to be investigated. however, as reported
earlier, lipofuscin can sensitize cells to oxidative stress (terman et al., 1999a), appar-
ently due to a high content of iron in pigment granules, and decrease the cellular
autophagic capacity (terman et al., 1999b) that may seriously aﬀect the biological
renewal machinery.
6. the mitochondrial–lysosomal axis theory of postmitotic cellular aging and death
it is reasonable to believe that autophagy decreases in aged postmitotic cells due
to an inappropriate distribution of lysosomal enzymes (brunk and terman, 2002a).
acid hydrolases are delivered to acidic vacuoles (late endosomes) in speciﬁc vesicles
that pinch oﬀ from the trans-golgi network (luzio et al., 2003). lipofuscin-loaded
lysosomes are integrated parts of the lysosomal system that freely fuse with auto-
phagosomes, late endosomes and other acidic vacuoles. with age, lipofuscin occu-
pies an increasing proportion of the lysosomal compartment, suggesting that
golgi-derived vesicles with acid hydrolases will have increasingly higher chance to
end up in lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes rather than in lysosomes degrading freshly
autophagocytosed material (autophagolysosomes). because acid hydrolases within
lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes are ineﬃcient due to indigestability of the pigment,
and because the overall production of lysosomal enzymes is apparently limited,
the functional capacity of the lysosomal system declines. this will lead to further
decrease of mitochondrial turnover, which even at young age was already somewhat
imperfect (see above). consequently, the accumulation of defective mitochondria
will increase dramatically, resulting in a progressive decline of atp production
and increased ros generation that will cause additional molecular damage. finally,
postmitotic cells overloaded with defective mitochondria and lipofuscin-loaded lyso-
somes will be unable to maintain their functions and die (fig. 2).

tion, inhibition of mitochondrial turnover with 3-methyladenine greatly accelerated
accumulation of defective mitochondria, resulting in premature death of cultured
cardiac myocytes (terman et al., 2003).
7. conclusion
mitochondria and lysosomes are key players in age-related alterations of long-
lived postmitotic cells, the degeneration of which is of fundamental importance for
the overall aging process. mitochondria are the main source of cellular superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, causing damage to various cellular components, while ﬁrst
and foremost to mitochondria themselves. lysosomes, the principal cellular recy-
cling organelles, cannot turnover all injured mitochondria and other subcellular
structures. some defective mitochondria, mainly enlarged ones, accumulate extralys-
osomally, while undegradable components of autophagocytosed mitochondria con-
stitute a considerable part of
lipofuscin.
mitochondrial ros production is also an important factor in lipofuscinogenesis,
which, in turn, interferes with lysosomal capacity to recycle mitochondria. potential
anti-aging strategies should thus include both the prevention of oxidative stress and
the facilitating of mitochondrial turnover.
