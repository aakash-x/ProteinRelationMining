enzyme replacement therapy (ert) became a reality for patients with pompe disease, a fatal
cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle myopathy caused by a deficiency of glycogen-degrading
lysosomal enzyme acid a-glucosidase (gaa). the therapy, which relies on receptor-mediated
endocytosis of recombinant human gaa (rhgaa), appears to be effective in cardiac muscle, but less
so in skeletal muscle. we have previously shown a profound disturbance of the lysosomal
degradative pathway (autophagy) in therapy-resistant muscle of gaa knockout mice (ko). our
findings here demonstrate a progressive age-dependent autophagic buildup in addition to
enlargement of glycogen-filled lysosomes in multiple muscle groups in the ko. trafficking and
processing of the therapeutic enzyme along the endocytic pathway appear to be affected by the
autophagy. confocal microscopy of live single muscle fibers exposed to fluorescently labeled rhgaa
indicates that a significant portion of the endocytosed enzyme in the ko was trapped as a partially
processed form in the autophagic areas instead of reaching its target—the lysosomes. a fluid-phase
endocytic marker was similarly mistargeted and accumulated in vesicular structures within the
autophagic areas. these findings may explain why ert often falls short of reversing the disease
process and point toward new avenues for the development of pharmacological intervention.

introduction
enzyme replacement therapy (ert) has been successfully
applied for a number of lysosomal storage disorders [1] and
is now available for patients with pompe disease (glycogen
storage disease type ii), an inherited deficiency of acid a-
glucosidase (gaa), the lysosomal enzyme responsible for
the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. glycogen delivery
to the lysosomes is still poorly understood, but is thought
to occur through autophagocytosis. the gaa deficiency
results in intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen in
multiple tissues, with skeletal and cardiac muscles being
most affected clinically. the disease phenotype ranges
from the most severe infantile variant to an indolent late-
onset form [2]. the infantile form is characterized by
cardiomegaly, progressive skeletal muscle weakness, and
death within the first year of life in the majority of patients
[3,4]. late-onset forms manifest as slow progressive
skeletal muscle disease with respiratory muscle involve-
ment but without cardiac involvement [5,6].
the concept of ert for pompe disease and many lysosomal
storage disorders is based on extensive experimental evidence
indicating that lysosomal enzymes can be taken up by the cells
through receptor-mediated endocytosis. cation-independent
mannose 6-phosphate receptor (ci-mpr) on the cell surface
binds lysosomal enzymes that are tagged with a mannose 6-
phosphate (m6p) recognition marker, directing the enzymes
into the endocytic pathway. the receptor–enzyme complex
enters the cells in clathrin-coated vesicles that fuse with early
endosomes, which in turn fuse with late endosomes. the acidic
ph of late endosomes induces the dissociation of the complex;
the enzyme is subsequently packaged into the lysosome, and
the receptor is recycled [7,8]. numerous proteins participate in
the sorting and trafficking of the lysosomal enzymes (reviewed
in [9]). the same endocytic pathway delivers endogenous
lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomal compartment. in pompe
disease, the recombinant enzyme is a 110-kda precursor
containing n-linked oligosaccharide chains modified with
m6p residues that enable the enzymes to bind the receptor.

like the 110-kda endogenous gaa precursor, the recombinant
human gaa (rhgaa) is expected to undergo sequential
proteolytical cleavage along the transport route to yield
intermediate forms followed by conversion to the fully active
mature lysosomal species [10,11].
both clinical trials and our preclinical studies have
indicated that ert is effective in glycogen clearance in
cardiac muscle, but reversal of pathology in skeletal
muscle has not always been achieved [12–18]. further-
more, there is a differential response to ert in type i and
type ii fibers in gaa knockout (ko) mice. type ii fibers,
which showed strikingly enhanced autophagy in compar-
ison to type i fibers, have proven resistant to therapy
[18,19]. autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent process, is a
conserved mechanism of degradation of long-lived pro-
teins and damaged organelles. double membrane-bound
autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic constituents des-
tined for degradation to the late endosomes and lyso-
somes, the sites where the endocytic and autophagic
pathways converge (reviewed in [20–22]). we now dem-
onstrate that there is a progressive age-dependent auto-
phagic buildup in ko muscle fibers and that this buildup
has a profound effect on therapy as it diverts the
recombinant enzyme from the lysosomes, the site of
glycogen accumulation.

in fibers from a 5-month-old ko mouse the receptor is abundant in the autophagic area. in fibers from a 24-month-old ko mouse most of the structures within

the ko fiber, is located toward the periphery of this particular fiber (ko 24m). bright structures with irregular shape are autofluorescent material in the ko mouse

associated membrane protein 1 (lamp1), revealed clus-
ters of lc3-positive vesicles in ko fibers from all muscle
groups examined; the increased autophagy was already
detectable at 1 month of age in the ko mice (figs. 1a and
1b shown for edl). the centrally localized regions of
autophagic activity in fibers from young 1-month-old
animals occupied a small segment (30â€“90 am in length)
of the fiber (fig. 1a). these regions contained clusters of
tiny lamp1-positive structures (some smaller than those
outside the autophagic area), typically without clear
membrane boundaries, and a number of lc3-positive
autophagosomes. these lamp1-positive structures were
often found within the distinctly lc3-positive autopha-
gosomes (fig. 1b).
autophagy increased with age in the ko mice. in 5-
month-old ko mice, the autophagic buildup, found in
every fiber, extended over most of the length of the fibers
and contained multiple lc3- and lamp1-positive
vesicles, as well as lc3/lamp1 double-positive vesicles
(fig. 1a). in 24-month-old ko mice, the autophagic area
was strikingly large relative to the size of the fiber. in
some fibers, the diameter of the autophagic areas was
greater than half the diameter of the fiber itself. more-
over, there seemed to be fewer vesicles within the area
compared to younger mice, and we found multiple
deposits of autofluorescent material (figs. 1a and 2). in
contrast to the ko mice, autophagy was not detectable in
fibers from wt mice of any age (shown in fig. 1a for a 24-
month-old mouse). thus, age-dependent autophagic
buildup in the ko is due to the progressive nature of
the disease rather than the result of normal aging.
the autophagic areas in 5-month-old ko mice had
intense ci-mpr staining and contained multiple late
endosomes, as shown by the presence of lamp1/ci-mpr
double-positive vesicles (the receptor is present on late
endosomes but not on lysosomes) (fig. 2a). fusion of late
endosomes and autophagosomes in the autophagic areas
may explain the presence of the lc3/lamp1 double-
positive vesicles (intermediate autophagosomes or
amphisomes) described above. alternatively, these lc3/
lamp1 double-positive vesicles may be a product of
fusion of autophagosomes and dysfunctional lysosomes
that are unable to digest the autophagosomal membrane
protein lc3.
the autophagic areas in 24-month-old ko mice had
intense signal when stained for ci-mpr. however, the
pattern of staining differed from that observed in the 5-
month-old ko, in that most of the signal had a broad
emission spectrum suggesting the presence of undigested
autofluorescent material (figs. 2a and 2b, ko shown with
hoechst). additionally, there were fewer lamp1-positive/
ci-mpr-negative structures in the autophagic areas
compared to younger ko mice, suggesting that the
number of intact lysosomes was reduced with age (ci-
mpr is a negative marker for lysosomes). some of the
autofluorescent material was contained within the lyso-

somes (lipofuscin), while some appeared to be outside the
lysosomes. there was no significant difference in the
distribution of the ci-mpr and lamp1 in 24-month-old
wt mice (not shown) compared to the 5-month-old wt
(fig. 2a).
endocytosis of rhgaa in live cultured type ii fibers
in ko
it seemed reasonable to assume that the autophagic
buildup and the changes in the distribution of the ci-
mpr may affect the trafficking of the therapeutic enzyme.
therefore, we analyzed the endocytosis of rhgaa in live
cultured type ii fibers from the ko mice. we isolated
viable single fibers with their satellite cells, surrounded
by a basal lamina but free of connective tissues, blood
vessels, and nerves, from 2- to 3-month-old mice. the
huge, centrally localized autophagic areas were clearly
seen without staining by low-resolution transmitted light
microscopy (fig. 3a shown for gastrocnemius). the acidic
nature of the vesicular structures within the autophagic
areas was confirmed by labeling live fibers with lyso-
tracker, which selectively accumulates in vesicles with
low ph (fig. 3b).
we exposed ko and wt live fibers to fluorescently
labeled rhgaa (alexa fluor 546-rhgaa) for 16â€“20 h,
extensively washed them, and analyzed them by confocal
microscopy (figs. 4a and 4b). in live wt fibers the
distribution pattern of the labeled enzyme was similar to
that observed in fixed fibers stained with lamp1 (fig. 4b;
see figs. 1a and 2a wt for typical lamp1 staining
pattern), strongly suggesting that the labeled enzyme
reached lysosomes. when we incubated live ko fibers
with labeled rhgaa, a significant amount of the enzyme
ended up in the vesicular structures within autophagic
areas (fig. 4a). similarly, alexa fluor 546-conjugated
dextran, a fluid-phase endocytic marker, accumulated
primarily in the autophagic areas (fig. 4c). the endocy-
tosis of the labeled enzyme was significantly inhibited
when the fibers were exposed to either mannose 6-
phosphate or unlabeled rhgaa prior to incubation with

enzyme in a live fiber from edl of a 3-month-old ko mouse. labeled rhgaa is concentrated in the autophagic area, which is marked by arrows in the dic image.

the labeled enzyme (the signal was detected in less than
10 and 20% of fibers, respectively; not shown), suggesting
that the enzyme entered the cell mainly through mpr-
mediated endocytosis and that the properties of the
labeled and unlabeled forms of the enzyme are similar.
to rule out the possibility that autofluorescence is the
source of the emission signal observed in the rhgaa-
labeled live fibers, we used spectral analysis of the images
to separate the alexa fluor 546 signal (see materials and
methods). the signal from the labeled enzyme remained
strong in the autophagic areas after linear unmixing of
the images even though autofluorescence contributed to
the intensity of the initial signal (fig. 4a). we obtained
similar results when we performed linear unmixing for
experiments with alexa fluor 546-conjugated dextran
(fig. 4c).
since the labeled rhgaa still contained a small
amount (b10%) of free dye as detected by thin-layer
chromatography (tlc), we incubated the fibers with the
dye alone. after linear unmixing, no alexa fluor 546-
specific signal was detected in live or postfixed fibers (not
shown). in contrast, in the postfixed ko fibers incubated
with the labeled enzyme (the labeled protein is expected
to persist after fixation) a strong signal was still detected
in the autophagic areas (fig. 4d). together, these data
indicate that much of the endocytosed recombinant
enzyme is trapped in the autophagic areas in ko fibers.
processing of rhgaa in myofibers from ko
the accumulation of rhgaa in the autophagic area
prompted us to look at the processing of the enzyme in
myofibers. we also compared the levels of rhgaa in
isolated muscle fibers to those in whole muscle tissue in
mice on ert. for these experiments we administered
unlabeled rhgaa either as a single dose or as multiple
injections into ko mice. we isolated both tissue and
fibers from edl, ta, and g muscles from each mouse. we
compared lysates from whole muscle tissue and fibers
from each muscle group by western analysis. as
expected, in all muscle tissues, the predominant species
was the 76-kda mature lysosomal form, and the 95-kda
intermediate was a minor product (shown for g in fig. 5).
unexpectedly, the level of the mature 76-kda form in ko
myofibers (f in fig. 5) from each muscle group was
significantly less than that from the tissue lysates (t in
fig. 5). this is in contrast to wt, in which the level of
endogenous enzyme is equal in both tissues and myo-
fibers. furthermore, in the ko fibers, the 95-kda inter-
mediate was significantly increased relative to the mature
lysosomal form,
indicating that the rhgaa was not
completely processed in ko myofibers.

multiple type ii-rich muscles. the process appears to
begin with the formation of a number of autophago-
somes, usually in the core of the fiber. at a later stage, the
same area becomes enlarged and filled with vesicles of the
autophagic and endocytic pathways. eventually, in older
mice, the vesicular structures appear to be lost, leaving
massive lakes of what we assume to be glycogen and the
remnants of membranes. these data, therefore, challenge
the current view that enlargement of glycogen-filled
lysosomes leading to lysosomal rupture represents the
only pathogenic mechanism of muscle damage.
the question remains as to what triggers the autoph-
agy in type ii ko fibers. nutrient limitation is a powerful
inducer of autophagy, and the autophagic response in
skeletal muscle has been shown to be fiber-type specific;
it is rapid and intense in type ii-rich muscle, but
moderate in type i-rich muscle [23]. we have previously
suggested that a local nutritional stress in a segment of a
fiber may be such a trigger [19]. another condition that
may induce autophagy is oxidative stress (reviewed in
[24]). based on experimental data showing reparative
autophagocytosis in fibroblasts exposed to mild oxidative
stress [25], kiffin et al. hypothesized that moderate stress,
affecting only a small number of lysosomes, may activate
autophagy to sequester the leaking lysosomes [26]. a
similar sequence of events could take place at the
beginning stages of pompe disease; the autophagy might
be up-regulated to remove small damaged lysosomes. our
observation of autophagic vacuoles containing lysosomes
without clear membrane boundaries in young ko mice
supports such a possibility.
regardless of whether oxidative stress contributes to
the initial stage of the disease, its role is evident at the

later stages from the increased formation of lipofuscin.
nearly exclusive concentration of lipofuscin in the
autophagic areas in the ko indicates that the process is
disease related. lipofuscin, an autofluorescent material
composed of oxidatively modified molecules, normally
accumulates in lysosomes of postmitotic cells during
aging. however, an abnormal increase in lipofuscin is
associated with oxidative stress [24,27,28]. enhanced
deposition of lipofuscin and large areas of centrally
located cellular debris were observed by hesselink et al.
[29] in muscles of another mouse model of pompe disease
(aglu
) [30]; these inclusions most likely represent the
autophagic area. the time course and the extent of the
changes in the aglu
mice, however, are quite differ-
ent from those seen in the model reported here. one
explanation for the discrepancy is that the disease is

the dysregulation of the autophagic pathway, which
converges with the endocytic pathway at the late endo-
somes, may lead to the mistargeting of the endocytosed
therapeutic enzyme. we addressed the issue by using a
unique experimental system—analysis of endocytosis in
live myofibers—which has been used only once before to
characterize the endocytic compartments in normal fully
differentiated rat myofibers from flexor digitorum brevis
muscle [31]. we have presented here experimental evi-
dence that the endocytosed therapeutic enzyme (and
dextran) in the ko fibers accumulates along the length
of the fibers, primarily in the vesicular compartments of
the autophagic areas. some of these compartments
represent autophagosomes, late endosomes, intermediate
autophagosomes, and possibly damaged nonfunctional
lysosomes unable to degrade the autophagocytosed mate-
rial. these structures, which include both intralysosomal
(lipofuscin) and extralysosomal undigested material could
be called biological garbage [24]. the recombinant
enzyme, trapped in these areas, is wasted since it is
diverted from glycogen-filled lysosomes in the rest of the
fiber, but is unable to resolve the autophagic buildup [19],
which continues to expand as the disease progresses.
furthermore, processing of the rhgaa precursor to
fully active mature forms seems to be altered in the
diseased fibers. cleavage of the precursor results in the
activation of the enzyme, and it is the mature forms that
are most active toward the natural substrate glycogen
[10]. the conversion of the precursor to the 95-kda
intermediate most likely occurs in the late endocytic
compartment. the subsequent conversion to the mature
forms requires both proteases and glycosidases and is
thought to occur in the lysosomes [10,11]. in the
myofibers, processing of the 95-kda intermediate to the
76-kda mature form seems to be stalled, resulting in a
shift in the ratio of these two forms toward the
intermediate with a lower affinity for glycogen. addi-
tionally, only a small part of the mature form detected in
muscle biopsies after ert actually reaches the myofibers.
thus, the mature gaa in nonmuscle components of a
muscle biopsy contributes significantly to the overall
level of enzyme detected after ert. this finding should
be considered when muscle biopsies are used to monitor
the efficacy of ert.
a number of factors make skeletal muscle a challeng-
ing target for ert, among them are its sheer mass, the low
density of ci-mpr [32], and the fact that the vast
majority of the administered enzyme is delivered to the
liver [17]. type ii fibers in the ko mice are at an even
greater disadvantage since they have lower receptor
density and lower levels of trafficking proteins compared
to type i fibers [19]. mistargeting of rhgaa in type ii
fibers exacerbates the problem. when the enzyme does
reach the lysosomes, it seems to work well. however, the
reversal of pathology in pompe skeletal muscle requires
more than clearance of lysosomal glycogen. furthermore,
assuming that similar autophagic changes occur in
pompe patients, the current therapy should be consid-
ered for presymptomatic late-onset patients, before auto-
phagic buildup occurs.
materials and methods
a 110-kda form of rhgaa was produced and purified from cho cells
(genzyme corp., framingham, ma, usa). the following primary anti-
bodies were used for immunostaining of fixed fibers: rabbit antiserum to
bovine ci-mpr (1:15,000; a gift from dr. stuart kornfeld, washington
university school of medicine, st. louis, mo, usa), rabbit anti-lc3
(microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; 1:250; a gift from dr. t.
ueno, juntendo university school of medicine, juntendo, japan), and rat
anti-mouse lamp1 (1:200; bd pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa). protein
a-purified and affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-rhgaa antibodies
were used for detection of gaa (covance research products, inc., denver,
pa). mouse monoclonal anti-gapdh antibody (1:5000; abcam, cam-
bridge, ma, usa) served as a loading control. alexa fluor-conjugated
antibodies (molecular probes, eugene, or, usa) were used as secondary
antibodies for immunostaining and for western analysis. lysotracker red
dnd-99 (molecular probes) was used for labeling acidic vesicles.
isolation of
fixed single muscle fibers and immunofluorescence
microscopy. white g, ta, and edl muscles were removed immediately
after sacrifice from wt and ko [33] mice and pinned to sylgaard-coated
dishes for fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer
for 1 h, followed by fixation in methanol ( 208c) for 6 min. single fibers
were obtained by manual teasing. fibers were placed in a 24-well plate in
blocking reagent (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa) for 1 h. the
fibers were then permeabilized, incubated with primary antibody for
overnight at 48c, washed, incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h,
washed again, and mounted in vectashield (vector laboratories) on a glass
slide. edl and ta in mouse are a good source of fast-twitch type ii fibers
without any contribution of slow-twitch type i myofibers; white gastro-
cnemius muscle contains only ~1% type i fibers [34].
isolation of live single muscle fibers. single live myofibers were isolated
from g, ta, and edl muscles of 2- to 3-month-old wt and ko mice, as
described [35] with modifications. briefly, each dissected muscle group
was placed in a sylgaard plate containing dpbs. muscles were pinned at
resting length and cleaned of any extraneous material (the epimysium,
fat, large tendons, and blood vessels) under a dissection microscope.
muscles were then digested in 0.2% (w/v) collagenase type 1 (sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa) in dulbeccots modified eaglets medium (dmem)

(gibco, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) for 1.5 h at 378c in an
atmosphere of 5% co2. myofibers were isolated under a dissecting
microscope by gentle trituration using a plastic pipette. individual
translucent myofibers were transferred to a fresh tissue culture dish that
contained warmed dmem. after three or four serial transfers myofibers
were cultured in the uptake medium [hamts f-12 medium (gibco,
invitrogen), 10% fbs, and 3 mm pipes, ph 6.7] [36]. our attempt to
isolate live muscle fibers from 24-month-old ko mice failed, presumably
because the fibers were extremely fragile.
protein labeling and gaa enzyme activity. rhgaa was labeled and
purified using the alexa fluor 546 protein labeling kit (molecular probes)
according to the manufacturerts instructions. the degree of labeling was
2.9–4.4 mol dye/mol protein. the amount of free dye in the labeled protein
fraction was determined by tlc. gaa activity of the labeled enzyme,
measured as described [37], was 50–80% of that of the unlabeled rhgaa.
endocytosis in live cultured muscle fibers. myofibers were cultured in
chambered coverglasses overnight in the presence of either alexa fluor
546-labeled rhgaa (200 nm) or alexa fluor 546-conjugated dextran (2
mg/ml; molecular probes) at 378c in an atmosphere of 5% co2. the fibers
were then washed with dmem and analyzed by confocal microscopy (zeiss
lsm 510 meta). in a separate series of experiments, the fibers were
incubated overnight with equal fluorescent units of the dye alone. in some
experiments the fibers were preincubated with 5 mm m6p (sigma) or a
100-fold excess of rhgaa (cold) for 2 h prior to incubation with labeled
rhgaa (70 nm).
spectral unmixing analysis. the muscle fibers, and in particular the
autophagic area, have considerable amounts of autofluorescent signal;
they will fluoresce even when not labeled with external sources of
fluorophores. in samples (fibers) labeled with alexa fluor 546-rhgaa, the
fluorophore and the autofluorescent compounds both emit in the same
range. traditional filter-based technology is unable to separate these
overlapping spectra, as only the number of photons per pixel is detected
and not the wavelength of the emission. to discriminate autofluorescence
signal from the alexa fluor 546 signal (which represents the location of
gaa), we employed a postimage spectral unmixing analysis. autofluor-
escence and alexa 546 emission signals were separated using the lsm 510
meta detector and the linear unmixing software provided. images of
unlabeled myofibers and alexa fluor 546-rhgaa (a fiber-free solution)
were collected using a 543-nm laser line and the emission range set from
582 to 700 nm. the reference spectra (emission fingerprints) from the
unlabeled fibers and alexa fluor 546-rhgaa are unique in shape. the
images from labeled and unlabeled fibers were collected using identical
optical paths and the lsm 510 meta detector. spectral unmixing compares
the emission profile of a sample to that of the stored reference spectra and
displays the contributions of alexa fluor 546 and autofluorescence
separately. this method allowed us to demonstrate the location of the
endocytosed alexa fluor 546-rhgaa in fibers with high autofluorescence.
a similar procedure was used for the experiments with labeled dextran.
western blot of muscle tissues and muscle fibers. whole muscle tissues
were removed from 2- to 3-month-old ko mice that received a single
intravenous injection of rhgaa (50 mg/kg). in some experiments multi-
ple injections of rhgaa were performed (30 mg/kg twice/week 16
injections) in tolerant ko mice [38]. mice were sacrificed 24 h after the
last injection. each hind limb was used to prepare protein lysates from
whole muscle tissues or from fibers. the lysates were prepared in ripa
buffer and separated by sds–page (50 ag protein/lane) as described [18].
blots were scanned on an infrared imager (li-cor biosciences, lincoln,
ne, usa).
animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with the
nih guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.
