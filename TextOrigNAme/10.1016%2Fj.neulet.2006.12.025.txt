abstract
kainic acid (ka) treatment is a well-established model of hippocampal neuron death mediated in large part by ka receptor-induced excitotoxicity.
ka-induced, delayed neuron death has been shown previously to follow the induction of seizures and exhibit characteristics of both apoptosis and
necrosis. growing evidence supports a role of autophagic stress-induced death of neurons in several in vitro and in vivo models of neuron death
and neurodegeneration. however, whether autophagic stress also plays a role in ka-induced excitotoxicity has not been previously investigated.
to examine whether ka alters the levels of proteins associated with or known to regulate the formation of autophagic vacuoles, we isolated
hippocampal extracts from control mice and in mice following 2–16 h ka injection. ka induced a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of lc3-ii,
a speciﬁc marker of autophagic vacuoles, at 4–6 h following ka, which indicates a transient induction of autophagic stress. levels of autophagy-
associated proteins including atg5 (conjugated to atg12), atg6 and atg7 did not change signiﬁcantly after treatment with ka. however,
ratios of phospho-mtor/mtor were elevated from 6 to 16 h, and ratios of phospho-akt/akt were elevated at 16 h following ka treatment,
suggesting a potential negative feedback loop to inhibit further stimulation of autophagic stress. together these data indicate the transient induction
of autophagic stress by ka which may serve to regulate excitotoxic death in mouse hippocampus.

the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate is known
to play an important role in a vast array of neuronal activities
as well as in the induction of excitotoxic neurodegeneration
through massive activation of its receptors [18,19]. kainic acid
(ka) is a potent glutamate receptor agonist with selectiv-
ity towards non-n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type glutamate
receptors [20,8]. ka is well known for its ability to induce
seizures within minutes of its administration and is followed
by a delayed excitotoxic neuron death in the hippocampus sev-
eral hours later, in part through an increase in intracellular
calcium and activation of calcium-dependent neuron death path-
ways [1,15,31]. both apoptotic and necrotic death of neurons are
associated with ka-induced excitotoxicity in vivo [30,11], sug-

gesting the existence of multiple death pathways induced by
glutamate receptor neurotoxicity.
autophagic stress results from alterations in autophagy, a
lysosomal degradation pathway that is responsible for the home-
ostatically regulated turnover of macronutrients and organelles
[4]. macroautophagy, the most prominent form of autophagy
in cells, occurs via the formation of double-membraned
autophagic vacuoles (avs) that sequester and shuttle damaged
organelles and macronutritents to lysosomes for degradation
by acidic lysosomal hydrolases [32]. our laboratory and others
have shown that autophagic stress leads to an accumulation
of avs that occurs either from an induction of their nascent
formation, or from an inhibition of their recycling due to a
dysfunction of acidic organelles [16,3,21,24]. if left unchecked,
autophagic stress can lead to autophagic cell death [16,3,21,24],
which has been shown morphologically to possess elements of
both apoptosis and necrosis [6]. recent reports have implicated
a role for the induction of autophagic stress in glutamate

receptor-mediated excitotoxicity of motor neurons [17,29].
although multiple types of cell death have been delineated
previously in excitotoxic neuron death, the contribution of
autophagic stress in models of glutamate receptor-induced
excitotoxicity has not been previously investigated.
the stimulation, assembly and recycling of avs in macroau-
tophagy is exquisitely regulated by a large group of proteins
(atgs) isolated originally in yeast [32]. the importance of atg
proteins in macroautophagy is emphasized by studies of their
genetic manipulation, such that over-expression of atg5, atg6
(beclin) and atg7 induce macroautophagy [13,9,25,27,26]
and their targeted deletion (or haploinsufﬁciency in the case
of beclin) inhibits macroautophagy [33,10,14]. deﬁciencies in
atg5 and atg7 in particular have been shown to induce neu-
rodegeneration in mice [10,14], which highlights the importance
of autophagy-associated proteins in maintaining neuron sur-
vival. in addition, the induction of macroautophagy has been
shown to be regulated by different classes of phosphatidyli-
nositol 3-kinase (pi3-k). class i pi3-k activates pro-survival,
akt-mediated signaling and has been shown to inhibit macroau-
tophagy, whereas the activation of class iii pi3-k has been
shown to stimulate macroautophagy [23].
all mice were cared for in accordance with the guidelines
of the nih guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.
all animal protocols were approved by the institutional ani-
mal care and use committee of the university of alabama at
birmingham. mice with 129svj× c57bl/6j background were
used in all experiments. the experiments were repeated with
multiple litters (n = 3 for each time point). mice were injected
with ka (20 mg/kg i.p.) as previously reported [34] and were
euthanized from 2 to 16 h following ka administration with
subsequent removal of their hippocampi and freezing on dry ice.
sham (0 h) mice not receiving ka served as controls for each
litter tested. hippocampi were homogenized in lysis buffer con-
taining 25 mm hepes, 5 mm edta, 5 mm mgcl2, 1% sds,
1% triton x-100, 1 mm pmsf, 1% protease inhibitor cock-
tail and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (sigma). twenty-ﬁve
micrograms of protein per lane were resolved via sds-page
and transferred to pvdf. blots were blocked for 1 h, rt (5%
milk), followed by overnight incubation at 4
c with primary
antibody (goat anti-atg-5 (santa cruz); goat anti-atg-7 (santa
cruz); rabbit anti-beclin (santa cruz); rabbit anti-phospho-
mtor (ser 2448) and rabbit anti-mtor (cell signaling); rabbit
anti-phospho-akt (ser 473) and rabbit anti-total akt (cell sig-
naling); and rabbit anti-lc3 (uchiyama laboratory). all blots
were also probed for rabbit anti-␤-tubulin (santa cruz), which
served as a loading control. blots were washed with 1× tbs
containing 0.1% tween 20, then incubated with secondary anti-
body (goat anti-rabbit igg, 1 h, rt) and washed. signal was
detected using supersignal chemiluminescence (pierce). blots
were scanned for densitometric analysis using un-scan-it soft-
ware (orem, utah). blots for phospho-speciﬁc proteins (akt
and mtor) were stripped subsequently using restore® west-
ern blot stripping buffer (pierce) then re-probed for total akt
and mtor. protein levels from hippocampi of ka-treated mice
(2–16 h) were normalized to control levels (0 h) in each western
blot experiment, with three different western blot experiments
fig. 1. lc3ii/i ratio in the hippocampus is signiﬁcantly increased by greater
than two-fold at 4–6 h post-ka treatment, indicating an increased accumulation
of avs. equal amounts of total hippocampal protein was loaded and detected
by western blot (a) followed by scanning and densitometric analysis of the
bands. graphical representation (b) of the ratio of lc3-ii relative to lc3-i

representing three separate time courses. levels of protein were
analyzed for signiﬁcance over time via one factor anova and
tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test. in all cases, a level
of p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
we began our study by assessing the effects of ka on lc3-ii,
the mammalian homologue of atg8 and a selective biochem-
ical marker for avs [12]. lc3-ii is the cleaved and lipidated
form of the cytosolic lc3-i, and these post-translational mod-
iﬁcations allow it to insert into the outer membrane of avs
[28]. signiﬁcant increases in the ratio of lc3-ii/lc3-i were
speciﬁc for 4 h (2.5-fold increase) and 6 h (2.2-fold increase)
following ka administration (fig. 1). these data indicate the
transient induction of autophagic stress resulting from acute ka
administration.
levels of atg5, atg7 and beclin were also measured fol-
lowing acute ka administration, as these proteins are known to
be essential for the induction of autophagy [33,10,14]. while
slight increases in atg5, atg6 and atg7 were observed
following ka administration, they were not found to be sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (fig. 2). these data suggest that a change
in steady-state protein levels of atg proteins is not necessarily
required for the transient induction of autophagic stress. in addi-
tion, the beclin-independent induction of autophagic stress has
been documented recently in sh-sy5y cells treated with the
dopaminergic neurotoxin mpp+ [5], which suggests that beclin
may not be always required for the induction of autophagic stress
through the formation of new vacuoles. conversely, the transient
induction of autophagic stress by ka may result from impair-
ment of lysosomal degradation pathways, which by deﬁnition
does not involve the atg5, atg6 or atg7-dependent formation
of new vacuoles.
activation of class i pi3-k is known to negatively regu-
late the induction of autophagy [23]. to determine whether
the transient induction of autophagic stress by ka was asso-
ciated with changes in pi3-k-related signaling molecules, the
phosphorylation of mtor and akt was measured (fig. 3).

fig. 2. levels of atg5 (conjugated to atg12), atg7 and beclin were not signiﬁcantly altered post-ka treatment. equal amounts of total hippocampal protein was

the ratio of phospho-mtor/mtor increased signiﬁcantly by
2–3-fold from 6 to 16 h following ka treatment, and a sig-
niﬁcant, 2.8-fold increase in the ratio of phospho-akt/akt was
observed at 16 h following ka treatment. the ka-induced acti-
vation of akt and mtor may result from a stress response in
the population of neurons surviving ka treatment. in addition,
the ka induced increase in activation of akt and mtor may
serve to negatively regulate the induction of autophagy, as evi-
denced by the decrease in the ratio of lc3-ii/i by 8–16 h after
ka treatment. previous studies in our laboratory have found a
ka-induced, c-fos-regulated increase in bdnf [7], which may

induce the activation of akt [2]. a previous study of intrastri-
atal ka administration in the rat showed a transient decrease in
akt phosphorylation measured 24–48 h following ka [22], but
differences in species, route of administration and time course
may explain this apparent discrepancy with the results of our
study.
the present study indicates the early and transient induc-
tion of autophagic stress in the mouse hippocampus following
ka administration. the induction of autophagic stress by ka
may be a stress response of neurons to increase the turnover
of proteins and damaged mitochondria under conditions of low
trophic support. furthermore, the transient nature of autophagic
stress observed in the present study may be due to the com-
pensatory increase in activation of akt and mtor, molecules
known to negatively regulate macroautophagy. the compen-
satory increase in pro-survival akt signaling may thus serve an
important role in regulating the induction of autophagic stress,
which if left unchecked has been shown to cause cell death
[16]. the transient increase in autophagic stress observed in
the present study may result from a stress response of increased
seizure-induced activity in the mouse and closely follows the
temporal induction in seizures by ka, but occurs well before
the advent of noticeable neuron death as reported previously by
our laboratory [34]. future studies are warranted to determine
the mechanisms and consequences of autophagic stress induc-
tion in models of excitotoxic neurodegeneration, and whether
its time course or extent can be altered with pharmacological
manipulation or additional trophic support.
