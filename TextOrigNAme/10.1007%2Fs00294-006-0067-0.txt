abstract schizosaccharomyces pombe isp6+ gene en-
codes a vacuolar serine protease, which is speciﬁcally
induced during nitrogen starvation. an isp6-disruption
mutant, isp6d, grew normally under normal conditions
but was defective in large-scale protein degradation
during nitrogen starvation, a hallmark of autophagy.
vacuoles are the organelles for such drastic protein
degradation but those of isp6d were apparently aber-
isp6d was infertile under nitrogen source-free
rant.
conditions with poor expression of ste11+, a gene criti-
cal for sexual development. a protein kinase a-disrup-
tion mutant, pka1d,
is prone to sexual development
because expression of ste11+ is derepressed. however,
isp6dpka1d still showed defects in ste11+ expression and
sexual development under nitrogen source-free condi-
tions. isp6d and isp6dpka1d were able to initiate sexual
development
to produce spores when only a small
amount of a nitrogen source was present. pat1 protein
kinase negatively controls meiosis, and a temperature-
sensitive mutant of pat1, pat1-114,
initiates meiosis
irrespective of ploidy at the restrictive temperature.
isp6dpat1-114 did not start meiosis under
however,
nitrogen source-free conditions even at the restrictive
isp6+
temperature. these observations suggest
contributes to sexual development by providing a
nitrogen source through autophagy.

introduction
in yeasts, growth and development are controlled by the
status of nutrients. schizosaccharomyces pombe cells
proliferate with vegetative growth in a nutrient-rich
medium. however, when transferred to a nitrogen source-
poor medium, they stopped vegetative growth and initi-
ation of sexual development (for review egel 1989;
yamamoto et al. 1997; davey 1998). sexual development
is initiated by a critical
transcription factor ste11
(sugimoto et al. 1991), whose expression is controlled
with both cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase a (pka)
and wis1-spc1 stress-activated protein kinase (sapk)
cascade. pka represses the expression of ste11+ under
nutrient-rich conditions. during nitrogen starvation,
pka is inactivated and the expression of ste11+ is dere-
pressed (maeda et al. 1994; watanabe and yamamoto
1996; kunitomo et al. 2000; higuchi et al. 2002). a null
mutant for pka1+, defective in the catalytic subunit of
pka, shows an elevated level of ste11+ expression even
under nutrient-rich conditions; hence, it is apt to commit
to sexual development. sapk cascade is activated by
nitrogen starvation, which causes induction of ste11+ at
404
the transcriptional level (kato et al. 1996; shiozaki and
russell 1996; wilkinson et al. 1996). cgs1+ encodes a
regulatory subunit of pka. its mutation leads to the
constitutive activation of pka. the cgs1 null mutant and
a point mutant of cgs1+ (cgs1-1) fail to respond to
nitrogen starvation (devoti et al. 1991; kunitomo et al.
2000), although the sterility of the cgs1-1 is overcome by
pregrowth on a minimal medium rather than a yeast ex-
tract rich medium (stiefel et al. 2004). tor1+ is a gene for a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinase, which is in-
volved in the response to various stresses including
nitrogen starvation, high osmolarity, etc. the null mu-
tants for tor1+ are unable to respond to nitrogen starva-
tion (kawai et al. 2001; weisman and choder 2001).
although the genes for sexual development are
transcribed with ste11, meiosis is repressed with pat1
kinase (also known as ran1) (beach et al. 1985; iino and
yamamoto 1985). inactivation of pat1 triggers the ini-
tiation of pre-meiotic dna replication, meiosis, and
spore formation. normally, pat1 is inactivated with a
speciﬁc inhibitor mei3 that is expressed speciﬁcally in
diploid cells (mcleod and beach 1988), but haploid cells
carrying pat1 temperature-sensitive mutation (pat1-114)
undergo meiosis at a restrictive temperature irrespective
of the nutrient conditions and ploidy (beach et al. 1985;
iino and yamamoto 1985).
besides sexual development, nitrogen limitation in-
duces autophagy, a system that operates the large-scale
degradation of cellular components including cytoplas-
mic protein, rna, and organelles. by degrading cellular
components, autophagy contributes to the recycling of
nutrients needed for survival and sexual development
under starved conditions. this takes place in the vacu-
oles, the lysosome-like organelles in yeasts. the molec-
ular mechanism of autophagy has been studied in
saccharomyces cerevisiae (for a review see kim and
klionsky 2000; ohsumi 2001). it involves a large num-
ber of genes and prb1 is one of the major ones, which
encodes a vacuolar protease (moehle et al. 1987) and
whose mutants are defective in autophagy and nitrogen
starvation response (zubenko et al. 1979; teichert et al.
1989; takeshige et al. 1992). small vesicles called auto-
phagosomes envelop cytoplasmic materials that are
destined for degradation. the autophagosomes and the
cytoplasmic materials are transported to the vacuoles,
where they are digested for the recycling of nutrients. in
prb1 mutants, autophagosomes are transported to the
vacuoles; however, they are not digested but are accu-
mulated in the vacuoles. the accumulated vesicles are
referred to as autophagic bodies. hence, the degradation
of cytoplasmic materials is severely blocked.
schizosaccharomyces pombe isp6+ encodes a putative
serine protease that is very similar to the s. cerevisiae
prb1, ﬁrst identiﬁed as one of the genes that are tran-
scribed speciﬁcally during nitrogen starvation (sato
et al. 1994). in a recent report, isp6+ is also transcribed
in response to several environmental stresses, such as
oxidative, osmotic, and heat stresses (chen et al. 2003).
moreover, the gene is transcribed with a ccaat-
binding complex (nakashima et al. 2002a), and it is in-
volved in the activation of a nuclease and large-scale
rna degradation during nitrogen starvation (naka-
shima et al. 2002b). a disruption mutant (isp6d) is
deﬁcient in sexual development during nitrogen starva-
tion. these results lead to the possibility that isp6+
contributes to sexual development through autophagy.
however, whether isp6+ is involved in autophagy and
how it is involved in sexual development remain to be
studied. s. pombe is advantageous for this study because
molecular genetics is available and much knowledge has
been accumulated on the molecular mechanism of sexual
development. so far, little is known about autophagy,
and characterization of this gene is expected to provide
important information on autophagy in s. pombe.
here, we report that isp6+ was required for large-
scale protein degradation and the structural changes in
vacuoles during nitrogen starvation, which suggested
that isp6+ is critical for autophagy. isp6d failed to ex-
press ste11+, and it did not initiate mating in a nitrogen-
free medium. when the medium contained a small
amount of a nitrogen source, isp6d underwent mating as
normal as that of the wild type strains. isp6 would
function for autophagy to supply a nitrogen source,
which is used to commit to or to complete the sexual
development process when a nitrogen source
is
unavailable from the environment.
materials and methods
strains and media
the s. pombe strains used in this study are listed in
table 1. cells were cultured in emm3 as described
previously (kawai et al. 2001). emm3 contained 0.5%
ammonium chloride, emm3 1/10n 0.05% ammonium
chloride, and emm3-n no ammonium chloride.
ammonium chloride is the major and virtually the sole
nitrogen source in the media. treatment for nitrogen
starvation and the counting of cell numbers were con-
ducted as described (nakashima et al. 2002b). general
and molecular genetic techniques followed standard
protocols (moreno et al. 1991). transformation of s.
pombe cells was performed by the lithium acetate
method (okazaki et al. 1990). cell cycle analyses were
conducted as described previously (kawai et al. 2001).
construction of mutants
to construct the isp6dpka1d double mutant, cells of
isp6d were mated with those of pka1d (jz633) on
emm3 1/10n plate to generate the diploid cells, and
tetrads were dissected. as described below, isp6d is able
to perform mating on the plate. ura4+-containing cells
were selected, and each mutation was conﬁrmed with
southern hybridization. isp6dpat1-114 was created by a
one-step gene disruption of isp6+ in pat1-114 (grimm

(underlined sequences were

ura4+-containing transformants were selected, and the
disruption was conﬁrmed by southern hybridization.
the suspension, 11 ll of a bovine serum albumin solu-
tion (10 mg/ml) was added and mixed well. the protein
was used as a carrier to precipitate cellular proteins
eﬃciently. the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for
15 min at 4°c, the supernatant was spotted onto a paper
disk (whatman 3mm 2.4 cm diameter), and the radio-
activity on the disk was measured with a liquid scintil-
lation counter after drying. results were expressed as a
percentage of the radioactivity in the acid-soluble frac-
tion to the radioactivity in the initial total fraction.
mating and sporulation
northern blotting
cells at the mid-log phase (1·107 cells/ml) were har-
vested, washed twice with sterile water, and aliquots
(5 ll) of the cell suspension were dropped onto emm3-
n and emm3 1/10n plates. cells with the prep1-isp6+
plasmid were cultured in emm3 with thiamine, which
were then transferred to emm3 without thiamine and
cultured for 10 h to induce isp6+ before plating. in
prep1-isp6+, expression of isp6+ is controlled under
the thiamine-repressible nmt1+ promoter (maundrell
1993). after incubation for 3 days at 25°c, sexual
development was inspected through a microscope. the
numbers of unmated cells, zygotes, asci, and free spores
were counted, and the eﬃciencies for mating and spor-
ulation were calculated according to the equations as
previously described (kunitomo et al. 1995). three
independent experiments were repeated, and in each
experiment, more than 1,000 cells were counted.
measurement of protein degradation
protein degradation was measured as described (tsuk-
ada and ohsumi 1993) with slight modiﬁcations. cells at
the mid-log phase were collected, suspended in emm3
containing [u-14c]l-phenylalanine (1.85 mbq/mmol) at
a ﬁnal concentration of 11.1 kbq/ml, and then incu-
bated for 2 h. labeled cells were harvested, washed
twice with emm3-n, and incubated in the same med-
ium at 30°c. at intervals, aliquots (0.1 ml) of the culture
were withdrawn, mixed quickly with 11 ll of 100% tri-
chloroacetic acid solution, and kept on ice overnight. to
total rna was prepared and northern blotting was
performed as described (kawai et al. 2001). the entire
coding regions of ste11+ and atf1+ were ampliﬁed with
pcr and were used as probes.
staining of vacuoles and nuclei
the vacuoles were stained as previously described (vida
and emr 1995; brazer et al. 2000). in brief, living cells at
the mid-log phase were incubated with 50 lm fm 4-64
(molecular probes inc. eugene, or, usa) in emm3
for 15 min at 30°c, transferred to a fresh emm3, and
then cultured for 30 min at the same temperature. the
cells were harvested, washed twice with emm3-n, and
then cultured in the same medium before inspection
under a ﬂuorescent microscope with a cooled ccd
camera (sensys, ol.1401e). for staining the nuclei, the
cells were ﬁxed with methanol at  20°c overnight, wa-
shed once with the pbs buﬀer, and then treated with
4¢,6¢-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(dapi) as described
previously (moreno et al. 1991).
electron microscopy
the cells were collected, washed with 0.1 m phosphate
buﬀer (ph 7.4), and ﬁxed with a mixture of 2% glutar-
aldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in the same buﬀer
for 2 h at 4°c. the cells were washed with the same
buﬀer and post-ﬁxed with 2% potassium permanganate
406
for 2 h at 4°c. after washing with distilled water, block
staining was carried out with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 1 h
at 4°c, and then the cells were embedded in 2% agar.
the agar blocks were dehydrated with a graduated
acetone series and were embedded in spurr resin. ul-
trathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate and were then observed with a transmission
electron microscope (hitachi h-7500) at 80 kv.
results
isp6d is defective in autophagy
autophagy occurs during nitrogen starvation, which is
always associated with bulk protein degradation on a
large scale. in order to examine the involvement of isp6+
gene in autophagy, ﬁrstly, protein degradation was
measured in isp6d (ss006) under a nitrogen starvation
condition. before nitrogen starvation, the cells were la-
beled with a radioactive amino acid. the labeled cells
were transferred into a nitrogen-free medium (emm3-

emm3-n, and then incubated at 30°c for the times indicated. at
each time, the cells were soaked in an acid solution, and the amount
of radioactivity in the acid-soluble fraction was measured with a
liquid scintillation counter. the value was divided by the amount of
radioactivity that cells absorbed at 0 h, which is shown as a
percentage. open circles wild type (jy476), closed circles isp6d

n) without the radioactive amino acid and then incu-
bated. the amount of radioactivity in the acid-soluble
fraction was measured at intervals. the acid-soluble
fraction contains both free amino acids and small pep-
tides, while proteins are precipitated; thus, it represented
the amount of protein degradation. in the wild type
(jy476), the amount of protein degradation increased in
proportion to the duration of nitrogen starvation
(fig. 1a). in isp6d, the amount of protein degradation
was about one-third of that of wild type during nitrogen
starvation. this defect was completely rescued by
expressing isp6+ from prep1-isp6+ (fig. 1b).
isp6+
encodes a serine protease, which is speciﬁcally inhibited
by phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (pmsf). when pmsf
was present in the medium, protein degradation for the
wild type was reduced to a level similar to that of isp6d
(fig. 1a). the results suggest that isp6+ is very impor-
tant for the bulk protein degradation during nitrogen
starvation.
we next studied the possibility that the defect in the
protein degradation is linked to the mutations defective
in the nitrogen starvation response. both cgs1d (jz858)
and tor1d (mk30) are not able to respond to nitrogen
starvation and are thus completely sterile as previously
described (devoti et al. 1991; kunitomo et al. 2000;
kawai et al. 2001; weisman and choder 2001). as
shown in fig. 1a, both the mutants showed the same
protein degradation as the wild type (data not shown for
tor1d), indicating that protein degradation is not always
associated with the mutation in the nitrogen starvation
response and suggesting that the bulk protein degrada-
tion speciﬁcally requires isp6+.
vacuoles are the central organelle for autophagy, and
the autophagy mutants show an aberrant
some of
structure of the vacuoles (takeshige et al. 1992). the
vacuoles were then visualized using ﬂuorescence dye
(fm4-64) staining and observed through a ﬂuorescence
microscope. in contrast to s. cerevisiae, the vacuoles in
s. pombe are much smaller in size. in the log phase,
small round shaped vacuoles were observed in both the
wild type and isp6d (fig. 2a). after 8 h of nitrogen
starvation, the wild-type cells became stuﬀed with vac-
uoles. in isp6d, somewhat larger-sized vacuoles were
observed in smaller numbers
(indicated by white
arrowheads), which suggests that isp6+ is involved in the
morphology of the vacuoles during nitrogen starvation.
the vacuoles of cgs1d were the same as those of the wild
type, indicating that the unusual morphology of vacu-
oles is not tightly linked to the mutation in the nitrogen
starvation response.
in the s. cerevisiae prb1 mutant, small vesicles called
autophagic bodies are accumulated in the vacuoles
during nitrogen starvation (takeshige et al. 1992; su-
riapranata et al. 2000; epple et al. 2001). in the wild
type, accumulation of autophagic bodies is not observed
because they are degraded rapidly. we then examined
whether the vacuoles of isp6d accumulate such small
vesicles. the 8 h nitrogen-starved cells were observed
with electron microscopy. as shown in fig. 2b, the

initiation of mating requires an hmg-box tran-
scription factor ste11, which is critical to gene expres-
sion for sexual development, and the transcriptional
induction of ste11+ is triggered by nitrogen starvation
(sugimoto et al. 1991). we then checked the possibility
that the transcription of ste11+ is aberrant in isp6d. the
ste11+ transcript was analyzed by northern blotting. as
shown in fig. 3b, ste11+ was expressed at basal levels at
time zero in both the wild type and isp6d. at 6 h after
nitrogen starvation, ste11+ was well induced in the wild
type, while it was hardly induced in isp6d. therefore,
isp6d has a defect in the transcriptional induction of
ste11+ during nitrogen starvation. the basal level of
ste11+ transcription seemed rather high. in our experi-
mental conditions, the transcript of ste11+ was detected
signiﬁcantly even in the log phase, which may be due to
the medium conditions. the cells were cultured in a
synthetic minimal medium, emm3, rather than com-
plete media.
expression of ste11+ is regulated by several tran-
scription factors including bzip dna-binding protein
atf1 (takeda et al. 1995; kanoh et al. 1996; watanabe
and yamamoto 1996; ohmiya et al. 2000). thus, ste11+
is not expressed in atf1d. atf1+ itself is induced with
nitrogen starvation. in isp6d, atf1+ was expressed nor-
mally with nitrogen starvation (fig. 3b), suggesting that
isp6+ aﬀects speciﬁcally the expression of ste11+ at the
step at least after the transcription of atf1+.
cell cycle arrest at g1 is a prerequisite for commit-
ment to mating. we then conducted cell-cycle analyses
using ﬂow cytometry. the cells of isp6d were starved for
nitrogen for 8 and 24 h before analysis. the cells of the
wild type showed the accumulation of the 1c peak,
indicating that the cells became arrested at the g1 phase
(fig. 3c). in isp6d, however, there was no 1c peak; the
major peak was 2c instead. the results showed that the
isp6d cells were not arrested at g1. cells of atf1d fail to
arrest at g1 during nitrogen starvation; however, the
expression of atf1+ was normal in isp6d. slight accu-
mulation of the 4c peak was observed in isp6d cells
during nitrogen starvation. the reason is not clear;
however, it is possible that cytokinesis was incomplete in
isp6d cells.
loss of isp6+ was epistatic over mutations causing
a constitutively active signal pathway for nitrogen
starvation
the signal for nitrogen starvation is transmitted by
pka, whose catalytic subunit is encoded by pka1+.
hence, pka1d is highly derepressed for sexual develop-
ment (maeda et al. 1994). the isp6dpka1d double mu-
tant (an3011) was examined for genetic epistasis to
sexual development. in the log phase, isp6dpka1d and
pka1d (jz633) were similar in cell morphology. average

the mutation of pka1+ on the expression of ste11+ and

nitrogen starvation activates wis1-spc1 sapk,
which leads to sexual development (kato et al. 1996;

similar to that of pka1d but was shorter than that of
isp6d (fig. 4a, the upper panels). in the log phase cul-
ture, isp6dpka1d cells initiated sexual development as
well as pka1d, while the cells of both the wild type and
isp6d did not mate: the mating eﬃciencies of isp6dpka1d
and pka1d were 2.6 and 2.3%, respectively. these ﬁnd-
ings suggested that pka1+ was epistatic to isp6+ in log
phase culture. in the nitrogen-free medium, isp6dpka1d
initiated sexual development at an eﬃciency of 2.4%
while pka1d did so at 42% (fig. 4a, table 2). it should
be noted that the value (2.4%) is proximal to that before
starvation (2.6%, see above). therefore, we concluded
that isp6dpka1d virtually did not produce either zygotes
or asci in emm3-n.
expression of ste11+ is repressed with pka, and
pka1d is highly derepressed for ste11+ expression (wa-

them to undergo meiosis and sporulation. spores accu-

were 74 and 94% in isp6dpat1-114 and pat1-114,
respectively. on emm3-n plates, however, isp6dpat1-
114 remained unstained with iodine (fig. 5a, the lower
panel). the frequency of meiosis was 2.4%, which was
much smaller than 95% in pat1-114. these results indi-
cated that isp6+ was necessary for the progression of
meiosis only under nitrogen starvation but not under
nutrient-rich conditions, suggesting that isp6+ is needed
in some steps after inactivation of pat1.
small amount of a nitrogen source rescued the mating
defect of isp6d
during our investigation, we noticed that, when cultured
to the stationary phase in emm3, some of the isp6d cells
mated with each other, formed zygotes and even asci
with spores (data not shown). thus, in the stationary
phase, isp6+ is not required for mating and meiosis. this
may be due to the diﬀerence in the amount of nitrogen
source in the media. emm3-n contained no nitrogen
source while the stationary phase culture would have
contained some nitrogen source. the sexual develop-
ment of isp6d was then examined in a nitrogen-limited
medium containing only one tenth of the nitrogen source
(emm3 1/10n). haploid isp6d cells mated with each
other at a frequency of 49%, which was comparable to
that of the wild type, 55% (table 3). thus, the mating
defect in isp6d was rescued by a small amount of a
nitrogen source in the medium.
some of the cells have developed to asci (fig. 6,
table 3), implying that even meiosis has occurred in
emm3 1/10n. in many asci, however, the spores ap-
peared to carry unclear outlines (fig. 6, indicated by
arrowheads), suggesting that these spores are immature.
as shown in table 3, the rate of the cells that developed
to asci with mature spores (that means spores having
clear outlines) was only 13%, much lower than that in
the wild type, 85%. the above results suggested that
isp6+ was required for the production of mature spores.
in emm3 1/10n, isp6dpka1d performed mating and
sporulation as well as isp6d but less than pka1d (ta-
isp6dwis1-dd also showed similar results in
ble 3).

discussion
in this study, we presented experimental evidence that
the isp6+ gene was involved in autophagy and contrib-
utes to sexual development by providing a nitrogen
source through autophagy. isp6+ was required for the
nitrogen starvation-stimulated large-scale protein deg-
radation (fig. 1), which is characteristic of autophagy
(takeshige et al. 1992). the morphology of the vacuoles
was aberrant in the nitrogen-starved isp6d using ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy analyses (fig. 2a). furthermore,
the small vesicle-like bodies were accumulated in the
vacuoles in isp6d according to electron microscopy
(fig. 2b). in the process of autophagy, cellular compo-
nents are enclosed within small vesicles, which are then
degraded in the vacuoles. some of the autophagy mu-
tants, such as the prb1 mutant, are defective in the last
stage, showing accumulation of autophagic bodies in the
vacuoles (takeshige et al. 1992). in s. cerevisiae, auto-
phagy makes the cells survive and promotes sexual
development. isp6d cells are infertile, and the viability
was reduced to 3.5% after 2 days of nitrogen starvation,
while the wild type showed 86% viability. isp6+ is in-
volved in the large-scale degradation of cellular rna
during nitrogen starvation (nakashima et al. 2002b),
which is also implicated in autophagy in s. cerevisiae.
these ﬁndings agree with the idea that isp6+ is involved
in autophagy.
one of the major roles of autophagy is to provide
nutrients. even when nutrients are unavailable from the
medium, the cells can obtain nutrients with the help of
autophagy. in isp6d, cellular nutrients would be less
recyclable. hence, the cells of isp6d would be in a seri-
ously starved state. isp6d cells are unable to undergo
sexual development in the nitrogen-free medium (fig. 3,
table 2), but were able to do so when the medium
contained a small amount of a nitrogen source (fig. 6,
table 3). the ﬁndings suggest that isp6+ is responsible
for the supply of a nitrogen source, and that the nitrogen
source is important for the initiation of sexual devel-
opment.
under nitrogen starvation, the nuclei in the mutants
with the isp6d background showed an abnormal ﬂat
shape and were located at the tip instead of the center of
the cell (figs. 3a, 5b). a similar phenomenon was ob-
served in a few mutants, which were taf1d (ueno et al.
2001) and one of the autophagy defective mutants (a.
nakashima and m. uritani, unpublished data). these
mutants failed to respond to nitrogen starvation, sug-
gesting that maintaining the nucleus in a proper shape
and position requires some machinery for the nitrogen
starvation response. interestingly, such nuclear mor-
phology seems to resemble the ﬂat chromatin that is
adhered to the cell periphery in wild type g0 cells cul-
tured for a prolonged period in nitrogen-limited medium
(su et al. 1996). as described above, isp6d cells were not
arrested at the g1 phase (fig. 3c) and reduced viability
during nitrogen starvation, suggesting that isp6d cells
411
did not enter the g0 phase. thus, the nuclear morpho-
logical change observed in isp6d would not be due to the
entry into the dormant g0 state. prolonged starvation in
wild type cells would result in the exhaustion of nutri-
ents, and the mutant cells defective in autophagy would
accumulate a lower amount of nutrients. therefore, it is
possible that cellular nutrient status is related to nuclear
morphology.
morishita and shimoda have previously reported
that the s. pombe ste12 mutant contains a few large
vacuoles and an eccentrically located nucleus. the au-
thors have suggested that the enlarged vacuoles interfere
with the normal positioning of the nucleus (morishita
and shimoda 2000). in this study, we demonstrated that
isp6d also had a small number of large vacuoles under
nitrogen starvation (fig. 2a). therefore, during nitrogen
starvation, the aberrant shape and positioning of nu-
cleus in isp6d may be caused by large-size vacuoles.
isp6d was defective in expressing ste11+ during
nitrogen starvation (fig. 3b), showing that isp6+ (or
recycling of the nitrogen source) is required for ste11+
expression. the expression of ste11+ is derepressed in
pka1d (watanabe and yamamoto 1996; kunitomo et al.
2000; higuchi et al. 2002); hence, it has a high tendency
towards mating (maeda et al. 1994). however, isp6dp-
ka1d hardly initiated mating and never expressed ste11+
during nitrogen starvation (fig. 4, table 2). thus, isp6
may act downstream of pka1. alternatively, the isp6/
autophagy pathway and cyclic amp-pka1 pathway ex-
ert independently each other. in addition, ste11+ is
positively regulated by the sapk cascade, (kato et al.
1996; shiozaki and russell 1996; wilkinson et al. 1996)
and wis1-dd mutation results in the constitutive acti-
vation of sapk (shiozaki et al. 1998); however, the
isp6dwis1-dd double mutant was unable to commit to
mating (table 2). therefore, when cells do not have
suﬃcient nutrients, the expression of ste11+ is repressed
even though pka is inactivated or the sapk cascade is
activated.
it is possible that ste11+ is not expressed because of
the shortage of certain nutrients necessary for tran-
scription, such as ribonucleotides. however, atf1+ was
expressed normally (fig. 3b). the expression of ste11+
would be regulated by a speciﬁc mechanism that moni-
tors the nitrogen source status in cells.
isp6d was defective in the induction of ste11+; how-
ever, ste11+ overexpression did not rescue the defect in
mating (data not shown). thus,
in addition to the
expression of ste11+, mating requires another step that
depends on the function of isp6+. when starved, hap-
loid cells become arrested at the g1 phase, which is a
prerequisite for mating. isp6d cells were not arrested at
g1 (fig. 3c), which may explain why the overexpression
of ste11+ failed to suppress the mating defect of this
mutant. a nitrogen source may be required for cell-cycle
progression during nitrogen starvation.
when isp6dpat1-114 was placed on the nitrogen-free
medium plate, the double mutant was deﬁcient in mei-
osis even at the restrictive temperature (fig. 5). meiosis-
412
speciﬁc genes are controlled by the mei4 transcription
factor (horie et al. 1998; abe and shimoda 2000), whose
expression depends on the initiation of the pre-meiotic
dna synthesis (iino et al. 1995). interestingly, mei4+
was expressed in isp6dpat1-114, but the pattern of
transcription was diﬀerent from that in pat1-114 (a.
nakashima and m. uritani, unpublished data). the

involvement of isp6+ at least at the transcriptional
regulation of mei4+.
imply that meiosis also requires
thus
in conclusion, our data demonstrate that isp6 plays
important roles in autophagy, expression of ste11+, and
progression towards mating and meiosis under nitrogen
starvation. when the medium contained a small amount
of a nitrogen source, isp6d underwent mating as normal
as that of the wild-type strains. isp6 would function for
autophagy to supply a nitrogen source, which is used to
commit to or to complete the sexual development pro-
cess when a nitrogen source is unavailable from the
environment. conversely, sexual development would be
arrested at mating or meiosis when a nitrogen source
was not supplied from either the medium or autophagy.
future studies will examine mechanisms by which
recycled nutrients through autophagy are sensed and
used to promote sexual development.
in s. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, autophagy has
been extensively studied, but in s. pombe, little has been
investigated yet. this study would provide a few
important clues for further studies on autophagy in s.
pombe. the main response to starvation is autophagy
and sexual development. thus, in order to obtain an
overview of the nitrogen starvation response, it is nec-
essary to study the relation between autophagy and
sexual development. such a study would provide
important insight into the mechanism of response to
nitrogen starvation.
