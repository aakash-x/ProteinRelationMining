20s-protopanaxadiol (1) is an aglycon metabolic derivative of the protopanaxadiol-type ginseng saponins. in the present
study, 1 was used to induce cytotoxicity for two human glioma cell lines, sf188 and u87mg. for the sf188 cells, 1
activated caspases-3, -8, -7, and -9 within 3 h and induced rapid apoptosis, which could be partially inhibited by a
general caspase blocker and completely abolished when the caspase blocker was used in combination with an antioxidant.
compound 1 also induced cell death in u87mg cells but did not activate any caspases in these cells. monodansylca-
daverine staining showed that 1 induced dramatic autophagy in both cell lines. elevated levels of superoxide anion in
both cells and reduced levels of phosphorylated akt in u87mg cells were also demonstrated. these results showed that
20s-protopanaxadiol (1) induces different forms of programmed cell death, including both typical apoptosis and autophagy
through both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
the most commonly used cancer therapeutic agents eliminate
tumors by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor
cells. although the cellular targets of different cytotoxic agents vary,
most of the signaling pathways activated by anticancer drugs
ultimately lead to the activation of caspases.1,2 in some cell types,
caspase-8 activation fully triggers the caspase activation cascade
and induces apoptosis by proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3,3,4
the principal effector of caspase. however, in some cell types, death-
receptor cross-linking fails to cause a caspase-8 activation, leading
to activation of caspase-3. in this case, the pathway involves
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of cyto-
chrome c from mitochondria, which causes cytochrome c-dependent
formation of a caspase-3 activation complex (also called the
apoptosome).5 although caspases are the principal mediators of
apoptotic cell death in many developmental and physiological
settings,6,7 they are not the single cause of execution of the death
command. in fact, recent data indicate that other forms of
programmed cell death can occur in the complete absence of
caspases.8

other related plants, have been shown to be cytotoxic to tumor cells
without any detectable toxicity toward normal tissues.9-12 a number
of studies have indicated that 2-induced apoptosis of tumor cells is
dependent on activation of caspase-3.9,11,12 in addition, 2-induced
tumor growth inhibition and/or apoptosis is related to reactive
oxygen species (ros) generation13 and p21 activity.10 we previ-
ously reported that while 2 caused apoptosis,
it was not ac-
complished through steroid receptors and was independent of p53
in various tumor cell lines.9 in addition, we found that although 2
can activate caspases, caspase activation is not absolutely required
for apoptosis.
all ginsenosides are believed to be metabolized in the gas-
trointestinal system through a series of deglycosylation steps into
aglycon derivatives, including 20s-protopanaxadiol (1) and 20s-
protopanaxatriol.14,15 some of these metabolites have demonstrated
a cytotoxic potency on tumor cells equivalent to that of 2.15-17
however, the pharmacological mechanism of 1-induced apoptosis
has not been studied in detail. in the current study, we have
investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in 1-induced
apoptosis in two glioma cell lines, sf188 and u87mg, with p53-
and pten- status, respectively. our results demonstrate that 1 can
cause cell death through a variety of mechanisms, including caspase-
related and caspase-unrelated pathways.
results and discussion
the glioma cell lines, sf188 and u87mg, were treated with 1,
and cytotoxicity was determined using a mtt assay. figures 1a
and 1b show that 1 induced cytotoxicity more readily in sf188
cells than in u87mg cells (p < 0.001). when both cell lines were
treated for 24 h, 43.4 (cid:237)m 1 was lethal to nearly 100% of sf188
cells, while 108.4 (cid:237)m was required to achieve 90% cell death of
u87mg cells in 24 h (figure 1a). these different sensitivities to
1-induced cytotoxicity were also evident from the results of the
time-course experiment shown in figure 1b. nearly 90% of sf188
cells died within 10 h of treatment with 108.4 (cid:237)m 1, but 24 h were
required to reach similar levels of cell death with u87mg cells (p
< 0.001). at 24 h, the ic50 values of 1-treated sf188 and u87mg
cells were about 24 and 38 (cid:237)m, respectively.
both sf188 and u87mg cells treated with 1 (>40 (cid:237)m) showed
positive tunel staining in an apoptag assay (figures 1d and
1f). the apoptotic nature of the cell death was also confirmed by
morphology under a light microscope and using dna laddering, a
mitochondrial membrane permeability assay, and hoecht staining

for nuclear condensation (data not shown). again, the apoptotic
markers appeared much earlier in sf188 cells than in u87mg cells.
positive tunel staining was seen within 3 h in sf188 cells (42.67
( 1.80%) (figure 1d) and in 7 h in u87mg cells (51.01 ( 4.15%)
with the same concentration of 1 (figure 1f).
the substantial difference seen in the time course of 1-induced
apoptosis between sf188 and u87mg cells led us to further
investigate the mechanisms involved. since 2, an analogue of 1,
was previously reported to activate caspase-3,9,12 the active forms
of various caspases were measured by western blot analyses. figure
2 shows that cleaved fragments of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 were
all present in sf188 cells treated with 108.4 (cid:237)m 1 within 2 or 3 h
(figures 2a to 2c and 2e to 2g), indicating the activation of these
caspases. in addition, the amount of activated caspases increased
with the concentration of 1 and the duration of treatment, suggesting
that activation was time- and dose-dependent. a general caspase
inhibitor, z-vad-fluoromethylketone (z-vad-fmk), partially
blocked the 1-induced apoptosis by 44.72 ( 6.9% (p < 0.001)
(figure 2l). interestingly, 1 did not activate caspases in u87mg
cells at all. despite the presence of caspases-3 and -8 in their
procaspase forms, cleaved fragments were absent in u87mg cells
treated with 1 for up to 9 h (figures 2j and 2k). in addition, the
same levels of cell death were seen in 1-treated u87mg cells with
and without z-vad-fmk (figure 2m), suggesting that cas-
pases were not involved in the 1-induced cell death processes in
u87mg.
the incomplete protection by caspase inhibitors for 1-induced
apoptosis in sf188 cells and the absence of caspase activation in
u87mg cells suggested a caspase-independent mechanism. since
it is known that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ros)
can induce apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner in some
â¥-) in both sf188
cells,18,19 the levels of the superoxide anion (o2
and u87mg cells treated with 1 were determined by measuring
intracellular hydroethidine (he) fluorescence. compound 1 mark-
edly increased the percentage of he positive cells in a dose-
response fashion (p < 0.001) (figure 3a). to determine the rela-
tionship between caspase activation and overproduction of ros in
1-induced cell death, viability was measured in sf188 cells treated
with tert-butylhydroquinone (tbhq), an activator of the antioxidant
response element (are), the general caspase inhibitor z-vad-
fmk, or both of them. as shown in figure 3b, the viability of 1-
treated cells in the presence of tbhq (10 (cid:237)m) or z-vad-fmk
(50 (cid:237)m) was 30.46 ( 3.47% and 36.0 ( 9.6%, respectively. com-
pared to viability using 1 (16.5 ( 2.2%), there was a partial protec-
tion by either agent alone (p < 0.01). interestingly, treatment with
both tbhq (10 (cid:237)m) and z-vad-fmk (50 (cid:237)m) together almost
completely inhibited the cell death induced by 1 (89.4 + 14.7%
cell viability, figure 3b). therefore, it is apparent that both the
caspases and oxidant stress are involved in 1-induced cell death in
sf188 cells.
to further investigate the mechanism of 1-induced caspase-
independent cell death, especially in u87mg cells, monodansyl-
cadaverine (mdc) was used to measure the levels of autophagic
vacuoles (avs).20 the results showed that sf188 cells (figure 4a,
a-c) and u87mg (figure 4a, d-f) treated with 43.4 and 108.4
(cid:237)m of 1 separately for 4 h both demonstrated strong positive
staining for autophagic vacuoles. thus, it is clear that besides a
typical apoptosis, autophagy is another form of programmed cell
death induced by 1 in both glioma cell lines.
a significant difference between sf188 and u87mg is that
sf188 is pten+ while u87mg is pten-. akt is constitutively
activated in cells that lack pten expression.21 inhibition of akt
phosphorylation blocks its downstream survival pathway, which
can induce apoptosis22,23 and autophagy24,25 in a manner independent
of caspase activation. therefore, the status of akt phosphorylation
in pten- u87mg cells was investigated. phosphorylated-akt (p-
akt) was detected by probing western blots with an antibody
specifically recognizing p-akt on ser 473. seven hours after

sf188 cells were treated with 10 (cid:237)m tbhq or without tbhq for

was no change after treatment with 1, which is consistent with the
pten-positive status of this cell line.
as one of the major metabolic products of ginseng, it is important
to better understand the biological activity of ginsenoside aglycons,
such as 20s-protopanaxadiol (1). in the present study, it has been
shown that 1 effectively induced cell death in human glioma cell
lines regardless of their p53 and pten status. simultaneously, 1
induced two types of programmed cell death, apoptosis and
autophagy, in both sf188 and u87mg cells. 1-induced cell death
may be mediated by multiple pathways, including both caspase-
dependent (such as in sf188 cells) and -independent (such as in
u87mg cells), and the latter may involve oxidant stress and
inhibition of akt phosphorylation, which may be responsible for
the autophagy induced by 1.
previously, fei et al.12 demonstrated that inhibitors of caspases-3
and -8 did not entirely block apoptosis of human malignant
melanoma cells treated with 2. this is consistent with the present
results with sf188 cells. to exclude the possibility that
the
incomplete inhibition of apoptosis was due to incomplete blocking
of caspase activation, caspase-3 and -8 activation was tested after
sf188 cells were treated with the general caspase inhibitor z-vad-
fmk. the results showed that z-vad-fmk completely inhibited
activation of both caspases in 1-treated cells by western blot assay

(data not shown). however, this treatment only partially blocked
apoptosis in sf188 cells. in addition, the same concentration of
z-vad-fmk completely blocked sf188 cell apoptosis induced
by tnf-r and cycloheximide (data not shown). together with the
fact that none of the caspases were activated in 1-treated u87mg
cells, but apoptosis still occurred at higher concentrations (figure
1), it was concluded that both caspase-dependent and -independent
mechanisms participate in 1-induced cell death. both mechanisms
are involved in the cell death of 1-treated sf188 cells, but only
the caspase-independent mechanism is responsible for the death of
u87mg cells. this explains why sf188 is more susceptible to 1
treatment than u87mg. the lack of caspase activation in u87mg
might be related to the negative status of pten, a possibility
currently under investigation.
in parallel to manifested apoptotic cell death, significant numbers
of autophagic vacuoles were evident in 1-treated sf188 and u87mg
cells. this is the first report suggesting autophagy may be an
alternative mechanism for cell death caused by a protopanaxadiol
saponin aglycon. oxidant stress is well documented for causing
caspase-independent cell death including autophagy in various
systems.18,19,26-28 it was reported that 1 plays a pro-oxidative role
in 2,2¢ -azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (aaph)-induced
hemolysis of erythrocytes.29 in the present study, levels of super-
oxide anion were significantly elevated in glioma cells treated with
1 at

occurred. consistent with high levels of superoxide anion found in

probably played an important role in the autophagic reaction by
the cells. the pten-negative status in u87mg cells resulted in
the constitutive activation of akt and ilk.21 it has been reported
that the pi3k-dependent pathway might regulate toxic levels of
ros generated by oxidative stress30 and that the pi3k/akt pathway
has been found to be important in regulating autophagy in various
tumor cells including u87mg glioma cells.25,31,32 thus, suppressed
akt activity and elevated oxidative stress may result in the caspase-
independent mechanism of 1 that induces programmed cell death
in an autophagic fashion in u87mg cells. on the other hand,
compound 1 was able to activate both caspase-dependent and
-independent mechanisms in sf188 cells, resulting in both typical
apoptotic and autophagic cell death, which is the reason for this
cell line being more susceptible to cell death induced by 1.
our study has shown clearly that 20s-protopanaxadiol (1) causes
programmed cell death through multiple pathways. we have applied
this compound to many different cancer cells of various tissue
origins and have yet to encounter a cell line that is not sensitive to
it (data will be published separately). given the genetic instability
and heterogenic nature of cancer cell populations, inducing cell
death through multiple pathways is obviously advantageous in
cancer therapy. our results from animal tumor models (to be
published separately) have shown that a ld50 at the maximum dose
of the compound could not be achieved in animals and an oral
dose of 25 mg/kg was sufficient to cause complete inhibition in an
intracranial rat glioma model, suggesting a reasonable bioavailability
of this compound. thus, compound 1 may be a potential lead
compound for further structural modification for anticancer drug
development. in addition, the different status of caspase activity in
sf188 and u87mg treated with 1 also provides an interesting
model for study of pathways responsible for caspase activation.

brl.
cell cultures and treatments. human glioma cells, sf188 and
u87mg, were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 100
units/ml penicillin, and 100 (cid:237)g/ml streptomycin, at 37 (cid:176) c in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 and fed every 3-4 days.
cells were seeded in 96-well or six-well plates 24 h prior to each
experiment, at a specific cell density for each experiment. a stock
solution of 108 mm (50 mg/ml) 1 was prepared in 100% ethanol.
compound 1 was diluted in dmem (supplemented with 2% fbs)
immediately before each experiment (final ethanol concentration was
0.25% v/v). at selected time points, the treatments were terminated
with the addition of mtt (for cell-viability assays) or 1(cid:2) sample buffer
(for western blotting). for caspase inhibition, z-vad-fmk was
dissolved in dmso to make a 10 mm stock solution and stored at
-20 (cid:176) c. before use, the stock solutions were diluted with dmem (with
2% fbs) to the desired concentrations. cells were pretreated with 100
(cid:237)l of inhibitor for 2 h at 37 (cid:176) c in a 5% co2 incubator, followed by

mtt assay. the viability of cultured cells was determined with
an assay based on the reduction of mtt by viable cells. cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 (cid:2) 104/well, 1 day prior to
experiments. cultures were then incubated with 2% fbs dmem
containing 1 for various periods from 3 to 24 h. at the end of each
time point, the culture medium was removed and 100 (cid:237)l of mtt (0.05
mg/ml in serum-free medium) was added to each well. following
incubation at 37 (cid:176) c and 5% co2 for 4 h, 100 (cid:237)l of lysis buffer (50
v/v n,n-dimethylformamide (sigma), 20% sds (bio-rad), and 0.4%
(v/v) glacial acetic acid in distilled water (ph 4.8) were added and the
plates were incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere (37 (cid:176) c

microscope (zeiss, oberkochen, germany). cells were considered
apoptotic if they exhibited brown staining and characteristic apoptotic
morphology such as cell shrinkage, pyknotic nuclei, and cell blebs or
apoptotic bodies.
protein extraction and western blotting assay. cells were treated
with 1 in 2% fbs dmem for different times and concentrations. both
detached and attached cells (collected by scraping) were pooled and
collected by centrifugation. the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs,
lysed with the addition of 1(cid:2) sample buffer (62.5 mm tris-hcl at ph
6.8 and 25 (cid:176) c, 2% sds, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dtt, 0.01% (w/v)
bromophenol blue), and heated to 95-100 (cid:176) c for 5 min. the protein
concentration was measured using a modified dc protein assay (bio-
rad). an equal amount of total protein (50 (cid:237)g/lane) from each sample
was used for immunoblot analysis. the proteins were resolved using
sds-page. proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
using a semidry transfer system (bio-rad) for caspases and a wet
transfer system (bio-rad) for akt and phospho-akt. the membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (bio-rad) for 1 h at room
temperature and probed with primary antibodies at 4 (cid:176) c overnight. the
membranes were then washed three times with pbst (phosphate-
buffered saline with 0.05% tween 20) and incubated with hrp-
conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse igg (1:5000) for 2 h at room
temperature. the reaction products were detected by enhanced chemi-
luminescence (perkin-elmer life sciences, boston, ma) using a kodak
image system (kodak, rochester, ny).
superoxide anion staining assay. hydroethidine (he) is a dye
that specifically stains for the superoxide anion.33 he was dissolved in
dmso to make a 20 mm stock solution and stored at -20 (cid:176) c in the
dark. cells were seeded in six-well plates 24 h before experiments.
they were then treated with 1 for 2 h, followed by the addition of 2
ml of 5 (cid:237)m he (diluted in pbs) to each well. the cells were incubated
for another 20 min at 37 (cid:176) c and harvested with a plastic scraper. the
cells were centrifuged at 1000g and washed twice with pbs, then
resuspended in 500 (cid:237)l of pbs for analysis with flow cytometry
(excitation, 480 nm; emission, 567 nm).
monodansylcadaverine (mdc) staining assay. the sf188 or
u87mg cells were treated with different concentrations of 1 (0, 43.4,
and 108.6 (cid:237)m). after 4 h of treatment, the cells were stained with 50
(cid:237)m monodansylcadaverine (mdc) (sigma) in dmem for 10 min at
37 (cid:176) c, washed once with pbs, and viewed using an axiovert 200
microscope under phase contrast and fluorescent filters equipped with
northern eclipse software (carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany). for
fluorescence measurement of mdc, the excitation wavelength was set
to 335 nm and the emission wavelength was 525 nm. mdc-positive
cells were those with accumulation of large mdc-stained red vesicles.
statistical analysis. data were obtained from at least two inde-
pendent experiments, each performed in triplicate or more. data were
analyzed for statistical significance by a two-tailed student’s t-test.
differences with p-values < 0.01 were regarded as statistically
significant and are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the figures.
