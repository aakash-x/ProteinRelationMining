cancer cells often have high levels of ros intermedi-
ates (szatrowski and nathan, 1991). it will be interesting
to see whether these cells show activation of wnt/b-cat-
enin signaling. an intriguing possibility is that cancer
cells hijack an ros and wnt/b-catenin-based mecha-
nism that allows cells in damaged tissues to rapidly
proliferate.

autophagy and caspase-
independent cell death: p19arf
enters the game
arf, often localized in the nucleolus, controls the
p53 pathway and ribosomal biogenesis. in a recent
issue of molecular cell, kimchi and colleagues de-
scribe a short mitochondrial form of arf (smarf),
initiation of translation, that
produced by internal
dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential
inde-
pendently of p53 and bcl-2 family members and trig-
gers caspase-independent cell death. the prodeath
function of smarf is dependent on the induction of
autophagy.
the tumor suppressor protein arf (p19arf in mouse
and p14arf in humans), encoded by an alternative
reading frame of the ink4a/arf locus, is an activator
of p53 (sherr, 2001). this tumor suppressor function of
arf is largely dependent on its capacity to antagonize
the function of mdm2, a p53 inhibitor, either by seques-
tering mdm2 in the nucleolus or by inhibiting its e3 pro-
tein ligase activity. however, p53-mdm2-independent
functions of arf in tumor surveillance have been pro-
posed (weber et al., 2000). accordingly, arf inhibits
growth and the induction of apoptosis in a p53-mdm2-
independent manner (lowe and sherr, 2003). the p53-
independent function of arf in cell growth has been
attributed to the inhibition of rrna processing in the
nucleolus via its interaction with nucleophosmin/b23
(bertwistle et al., 2004). the molecular mechanism un-
derlying the p53-independent prodeath function of arf
has not yet been determined.
in a recent issue of molecular cell, kimchi and col-
leagues (reef et al., 2006) shed new light on the pro-
death p53-independent function of arf. they demon-
strated that a short form of the protein, designated
smarf (short mitochondrial arf), can be generated
by internal initiation of translation at the methionine resi-
due at position 45 in mouse and position 48 in humans.
these short forms of arf lack the n-terminal functional
domains of the full-length protein required for mdm2
binding, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, inhibition of
rrna processing, and nucleolar localization. as with
the full-length protein, the short isoform is upregulated
in response to proliferative signals of cellular and viral
oncogenes. although both full-length and smarf were
produced in equal amounts in an in vitro translation
assay, the short form represents only a small fraction
of total arf in vivo. the low steady-state level of smarf
is maintained by proteasome-mediated degradation. in
fact, smarf is a short-lived protein with a half-life of
less than 1 hr, whereas the full-length p19arf is more
stable, with a half-life of approximately 6 hr. these fea-
tures were also extended to rat p19arf even though no
corresponding methionine residue is present in the pub-
lished sequence. this suggests that the generation of
smarf is conserved among mammals and that differ-
ent mechanisms are probably used to produce it.
the production of smarf was independent of p53 cell
status but was not observed in nih3t3 cells that lack the
ink4a/arf locus. the mitochondrial
localization of
smarf was determined by immunolocalization and
previews

differential centrifugation. resistance to proteinase k
suggested that smarf is an intramitochondrial protein.
transfection with dnp19arf that encodes smarf al-
tered the morphology of mitochondria, which con-
densed, rounded up, and clustered in the perinuclear
region of hela cells. notably, expression of smarf
dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential. these
mitochondrial effects of smarf were p53-independent
and were also independent of pro- (bax, bak) and anti-
apoptotic (bcl-2, bcl-xl) proteins of the bcl-2 family. de-
spite the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane poten-
tial by smarf, cytochrome c was not released to the
cytosol, suggesting that the outer mitochondrial mem-
brane was intact, nor was atp depletion observed. the
expression of smarf in 293t cells induced loss of cell vi-
ability comparable to cultures transfected with tnfr1
(p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor-1). in contrast to
tnfr-1-induced cell death, smarf-induced cell death
was caspase-independent and characterized by the ac-
cumulation of autophagic vacuoles. this accumulation
occurred after disruption of mitochondrial membrane
potential induced by smarf. macroautophagy (called
here autophagy) is a lysosomal catabolic pathway for in-
tracellular macromolecules and organelles (klionsky and
emr, 2000). depending on the cellular setting, stimula-
tion of autophagy is either a cytoprotective mechanism
or a cell death mechanism (levine and yuan, 2005).
atg5 and beclin 1 are two atg proteins needed for auto-
phagosome formation (klionsky and emr, 2000). kimchi
and colleagues (reef et al., 2006) showed that sirna-
mediated knockdown of atg5 or beclin 1 attenuated
cell death in smarf-expressing cells. thus, the auto-
phagic machinery contributed to the caspase-indepen-
dent cell death process.
these very interesting ﬁndings provide a molecular
mechanism for the p53-independent prodeath activity
of arf. they also raise the interesting possibility that
the smarf mitochondrial-based mechanism might be
a backup mechanism for the full-length arf nuclear
pathway when p53 and caspase-dependent cell death
are nonfunctional. from the study by kimchi and col-
leagues (reef et al., 2006), it is not known whether ex-
pression of full-length and smarf is systematically
controlled in a coordinated fashion or how the novel
activity associated with smarf is critical to the tumor
suppressor function of arf. the recent demonstration
that p53 stimulates autophagy (feng et al., 2005) sug-
gests that full-length arf can control autophagy by
a p53-dependent mechanism and smarf by a p53-
independent mechanism (reef et al., 2006). from
these results, it is tempting to speculate that autophagy,
by triggering type 2 cell death or autophagic cell
death (here referred to as caspase-independent and
atg-dependent cell death), is a tumor suppressor pro-
cess downstream of arf. however, the effect of au-
tophagy mediated by the p53-arf axis on cell survival
and cell death has yet to be investigated. while the ﬁnd-
ings of kimchi and colleagues (reef et al., 2006) provide
insight into the molecular mechanism of the p53-inde-
pendent function of arf, many questions remain unan-
swered. how is smarf targeted to mitochondria? how
does smarf dissipate mitochondrial membrane poten-
tial? is autophagy stimulated and smarf accumulated in
pathophysiological settings associated with inhibited
proteasome function? how is autophagy triggered in
smarf-expressing cells, and what is its role in cas-
pase-independent cell death? since mitochondrial dys-
function is an evolutionarily conserved stimulator of
autophagy from yeast to mammals (rodriguez-enriquez
et al., 2004, priault et al., 2005),
it is possible that
smarf-induced mitochondrial dysfunction stimulates
autophagy and selective elimination of mitochondria
through mitophagy (rodriguez-enriquez et al., 2004).
further studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism
underlying autophagy regulation by mitochondria will
provide greater insight into the role of the autophagy-
mitochondria axis in various human diseases including
cancer.
