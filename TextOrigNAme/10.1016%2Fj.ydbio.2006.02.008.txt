abstract
mutations in mcoln1, which encodes the protein h-mucolipin-1, result in the lysosomal storage disease mucolipidosis type iv. studies on cup-
5, the human orthologue of h-mucolipin-1 in caenorhabditis elegans, have shown that these proteins are required for lysosome biogenesis. we show
here that the lethality in cup-5 mutant worms is due to two defects, starvation of embryonic cells and general developmental defects. starvation leads
to apoptosis through a ced-3-mediated pathway. we also show that providing worms with a lipid-soluble metabolite partially rescues the embryonic
lethality but has no effect on the developmental defects, the major cause of the lethality. these results indicate that supplementing the metabolic
deficiency of mucolipidosis type iv patients may not be sufficient to alleviate the symptoms due to tissue degeneration.

introduction
mucolipidosis type iv patients have two classes of
symptoms (altarescu et al., 2002; bach, 2001). the first
class, which includes corneal clouding and achlorhydria is due
to the accumulation of large lipid-rich vacuoles in the respective
tissues. the second class, which includes psychomotor
retardation, is due to atrophy of some regions of the brain.
the gene responsible for this disease encodes the protein h-
mucolipin-1 that belongs to the “transient receptor potential”
family of proteins (bargal et al., 2000; bassi et al., 2000; sun et
al., 2000). h-mucolipin-1 has been shown to function as a non-
selective cation channel whose channel activity is modulated by
ph (laplante et al., 2002; raychowdhury et al., 2004).
the c. elegans cup-5 protein is the orthologue of h-
mucolipin-1 (fares and greenwald, 2001b). expression of h-
mucolipin-1 in worms rescues all of the cup-5 mutant pheno-
types (hersh et al., 2002; treusch et al., 2004). as in human
patients, cup-5 mutations have two classes of symptoms. the
first class is the presence of large vacuoles and the absence of
lysosomal degradation in various cell types due to a defect in

lysosome biogenesis (fares and greenwald, 2001b; hersh et al.,
2002; treusch et al., 2004). the second class is a maternal effect
embryonic lethality and increased apoptosis in the dying
embryos (hersh et al., 2002). significantly,
the embryonic
lethality is only partially rescued by mutations in effectors of cell
death ced-3 or ced-4 (hersh et al., 2002). furthermore, the
majority of eggs that do hatch in the presence of ced-3 or ced-4
mutations arrest as l1 larvae (hersh et al., 2002). cup-5 mutants
therefore provide an excellent model to determine the effects of
lysosomal dysfunction on cellular metabolism and on tissue
structuring, and to determine the relative contribution of each to
lethality.
materials and methods
c. elegans strains and methods
standard methods were used for genetic analysis (brenner, 1974). rnai was
done by the feeding method as previously described (timmons and fire, 1998).
the cdis77 transgenic line of gfp∷lgg-1 was obtained by bombardment
(praitis et al., 2001). markers used: cup-5(ar465) iii (fares and greenwald,
2001b); cup-5(zu223) iii (hersh et al., 2002); cup-5(n3194) iii (hersh et al.,
2002); unc-36(e251) iii results in the worm having an uncoordinated (unc)
phenotype (brenner, 1974) and is closely linked to cup-5 (fares and greenwald,
2001a, 2001b); rme-2(b1008) iv (grant and hirsh, 1999); rme-1(b1045) v
(grant et al., 2001); tag-283(gk378) v is a deletion within the open reading

frame generated by the worm gene knockout consortium; qc1 is a balancer
chromosome that suppresses recombination between cup-5 and unc-36 (graham
and kimble, 1993); ced-4(n1162) iii (yuan and horvitz, 1992); ced-3(n717) iv
(ellis and horvitz, 1986); aris37[pmyo-3∷ssgfp] i (fares and greenwald,
2001a); bis1[vit-2∷gfp; prf4] expresses a fusion of the worm yp170 protein
vit-2 to gfp (grant and hirsh, 1999). cup-5(zu223) unc-36(e251) or ced-4
(n1162) cup-5(n3194) worms bearing various transgenes were isolated from
qc1-balanced parent heterozygotes; the eggs from these homozygous progeny
were analyzed in the various assays.
times on each sample and the average measurement was used as a dna
concentration. the adjusted atp measurement from each sample was then
divided by the amount of genomic dna in the sample to get the normalized
values. we could not use a protein assay because cup-5(zu223) embryos are
defective in protein degradation. the results represent the average of the nine
normalized values for each strain grown on plates with or without methylpyr-
uvate (three plates for each condition, three luciferase assays per plate); the bars
represent standard deviations.
methylpyruvate feeding
for all methylpyruvate experiments, methylpyruvate (sigma, st. louis,
mo) was added to the ngm medium at a concentration of 14 mm before the
plates were poured. in addition, op50 was spun down and resuspended in a
14 mm solution of methylpyruvate before seeding the plates.
lysotracker staining
lysotracker (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) was added to the ngm medium at a
concentration of 2 μm before the plates were poured. in addition, op50 was spun
down and resuspended in a 2 μm solution of lysotracker before seeding the
plates.
measuring embryonic viability
to measure viability, adult worms were allowed to lay eggs overnight at 20°.
the adults were then removed and the percentage of eggs that hatched after one
day was determined at 20°. each experiment was repeated three times and at
least 90 eggs were counted in each case. the results represent the average of
these three experiments and the bars represent standard deviations.
tunnel assay
the tunnel assays were carried out as described previously, with one
deviation, using the in situ cell-death detection kit from roche (wang et al.,
2002). we permeabilized embryos using the freeze-crack method, as described
previously, instead of bleaching (bossinger et al., 2004). this was done to
eliminate false positives due to differences in susceptibility to bleach of the
various strains. the negative controls for staining in which fixed embryos were
incubated solely with label solution without
the addition of terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase did not result in any labeling of embryos.
molecular methods
standard methods were used for the manipulation of recombinant dna
(sambrook et al., 1989). all enzymes were from new england biolabs (beverly,
ma), unless otherwise indicated.
statistical methods
student's t test was used to compare average measurements from two
samples using a two-tailed distribution (tails = 2) and a two-sample unequal
variance (type = 2).
atp measurements
microscopy
150 to 300 adult hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs for 1 day on ngm
plates with or without methylpyruvate at 20°. for each growth condition, three
different plates were assayed for each strain. the worms plus eggs were
harvested, bleached, and the resulting egg suspensions were washed three times
with 100 mm tris, 4 mm edta ph 7.75 and resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mm
tris, 4 mm edta ph 7.75. each egg suspension was quick-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and immediately boiled for 15 min (before thawing). the suspension
was then sonicated using a fisher sonic dismembrator model 300 (hampton,
nh) for 20 s (4 s pulses at 30% followed by 5 s on ice). this egg suspension was
again quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, immediately boiled for 15 min (before
thawing), and sonicated in a branson 1210 water sonicator (raleigh, nc). the
suspension was then spun down for 1 min at 13,000 rpm in a microfuge and the
supernatant was kept at −80° until used.
the atp bioluminescence assay kit hsii (roche, indianapolis, in) was
used to measure atp levels according to the manufacturer's instructions. fifty
microliters of the (sometimes diluted) sample was mixed with 50 μl of the
luciferase reagent for each measurement. three assays were done for each sample
and the average measurement was used for determining atp concentration after
adjusting for background fluorescence from luciferase. background fluorescence
measurements were: (1) 50 μl of the (diluted) sample mixed with 50 μl of
100 mm tris, 4 mm edta ph 7.75, and (2) 50 μl of 100 mm tris, 4 mm edta
ph 7.75 mixed with 50 μl of the luciferase reagent. the atp standards were
diluted in 100 mm tris, 4 mm edta ph 7.75. all measurements were done in a
microtiter plate using an ml3000 luminometer (dynatech laboratories,
bridgewater, nj). fifty microliters of luciferase was electronically injected
onto 50 μl of the sample in the microtiter plate and the fluorescence measurement
was determined by integrating for 10 s after a 1 s delay. each sample was
measured three times. all measurements were within the linear portion of the
curve determined using the atp standards. in our hands, the linear portion
corresponded to [atp] between 10−6 m and 10−8 m. to normalize for number of
cells assayed from each sample, we used the invitrogen picogreen assay to
measure fluorescence using an flx800 bio-tek instrument (winooske, vt) as
described previously (zhu et al., 1996). the picogreen assay was done three
adult worms were allowed to lay eggs for one day on the ngm plates
supplemented with lysotracker ± methylpyruvate. embryos were placed in m9
buffer for imaging. confocal images were taken with a nikon pcm 2000, using
hene 543 excitation for the red dye and argon 488 for the green dye. exactly the
same exposure and magnification was used to capture the embryos from
different strains that are expressing the same marker.
all of the confocal images of wild-type and cup-5 mutant embryos were
opened using adobe photoshop (adobe systems incorporated, san jose, ca)
and analyzed without any modification. at
least 30 discrete intracellular
structures from the acquired images were highlighted and the number of pixels
included was determined. the reported values reflect the average surface areas
of the highlighted structures (1 pixel is approximately 0.01 μm2). the bars on the
chart represent standard deviations.
immunofluorescence staining of embryos using the ibf-2 antibody mh33
was done as previously described (rappleye et al., 1999). immunofluorescence
staining of embryos using antibodies against yp170 and rme-2 was done as
previously described (britton and murray, 2004). immunofluorescence staining
of embryos using the lin-12 antibody was done as previously described
(hermann et al., 2000). exactly the same exposure and magnification was used
to capture the embryos from different strains stained with the same antibodies.
results
there are two kinds of cup-5 alleles: (1) cup-5(ar465) is a
hypomorphic mutation that disrupts lysosome biogenesis in
scavenger cells called coelomocytes but has no effect on
embryonic viability (fares and greenwald, 2001b); (2) cup-5
(zu223) and cup-5(n3194) are null alleles that result in large
endosome/lysosome vacuoles in both coelomocytes and in
embryonic cells, and that cause maternal effect lethality (hersh
et al., 2002; treusch et al., 2004).

embryos lacking cup-5 have a defect in yolk processing
a defect in lysosome biogenesis in embryos lacking cup-5
should lead to the inability of embryonic cells to degrade yolk.
starvation is a likely consequence of this defect. in c. elegans,
yolk is endocytosed and stored in vesicles by oocytes. during
development, the yolk is degraded to provide energy and basic
metabolites (for example,
lipids and amino acids) for the
developing cells (britton and murray, 2004; grant and hirsh,
1999). we first looked in vivo at the fate of the c. elegans yolk
protein yp170 using a gfp fusion (grant and hirsh, 1999).
yp170∷gfp is normally endocytosed by wild-type oocytes and
is largely degraded over the course of the development of the
embryos (britton and murray, 2004; grant and hirsh, 1999).
loss of cup-5 did not affect the uptake and processing of yolk by
oocytes: the sizes of yp170∷gfp compartments in wild-type
and cup-5(zu223) oocytes were very similar (p = 0.4) (fig. 1).
in early embryos, there was a slight (p = 0.1) increase in the
average size of yp170∷gfp compartments in cup-5(zu223)
compared to wild type (fig. 1). the lysosomal defect was more
obvious in older embryos which showed an increase in the size
and in the intensity of yp170∷gfp-containing granules in
most cells of cup-5(zu223) relative to the same granules in
embryonic cells of wild-type embryos at the same stage of
development; cup-5(ar465) embryos at
the same stage of
development were slightly but significantly larger than wild-
type yp170∷gfp granules (p = 5.7 × 10− 4 compared to wild
type) (figs. 2a, b). co-staining oocytes and embryos with the
lysosomal marker lysotracker red showed almost complete
overlap with the yp170∷gfp granules (figs. 1 and 2a). this
result indicates that older cup-5-null embryos are defective in
the processing of yolk.
embryos lacking cup-5 have a defect in receptor degradation
we wanted to determine whether cup-5(zu223) embryos also
have defects in the degradation of cell surface receptors. rme-
2, the c. elegans yolk receptor, is found at the surface of
oocytes, appears in intracellular vesicles in one and two-cell
stage embryos and disappears soon after (britton and murray,
2004; grant and hirsh, 1999). consistent with the lysosomal
defect, cup-5(zu223) embryos retained rme-2 in intracellular
compartments later in development where it co-localized with
yolk proteins (fig. 2c). furthermore, ced-3(n717); cup-5
(zu223) double-mutant embryos also did not degrade rme-2
or yp170, indicating that the partial suppression of the lethality
by ced-3 mutations is not due to rescue of the lysosomal defect
(fig. 2c). at later stages of embryogenesis, rme-2 staining is
lost indicating that there is a reduction in the rate of lysosomal
processing as opposed to a complete block (l. schaheen and h.
fares, data not shown).
lin-12 is a c. elegans notch that is required for the proper
morphogenesis of
the developing intestine in embryos
(hermann et al., 2000). lin-12 localizes asymmetrically to
the surface of specific intestinal cells on one side of
developing embryos (fig. 3) (hermann et al., 2000). this
lin-12 staining disappears at later stages of embryogenesis

(fig. 3). cup-5(zu223) embryos showed a similar staining
pattern to wild type at early stages of development. contrary
to wild type, we could still detect punctate staining inside cells
of cup-5(zu223) embryos at later stages, indicating that there is
a delay in the degradation of lin-12 in the absence of cup-5
(fig. 3).
embryos lacking cup-5 have reduced levels of atp
to ascertain that the reduced rate of yolk degradation was
leading to starvation, we measured atp levels in the various
strains (fig. 2d). we indeed found approximately a ten-fold
reduction in the levels of atp in cup-5(zu223) or ced-3(n717);

cup-5(zu223) embryos compared to wild-type embryos. we did
not observe a statistically significant difference in the levels of
atp between cup-5(ar465) and wild-type embryos.
embryos lacking cup-5 activate autophagy
cells that are starved activate a process called autophagy
their own cytoplasm and
where they sequester some of
organelles in specialized compartments called autophagosomes
and subsequently fuse these with lysosomes to provide
themselves with nutrients (dunn, 1994). to visualize autophagy
in embryos, we used transgenic worms that express a gfp-
tagged lgg-1, the orthologue of yeast apg8p and mammalian
map-lc3 (melendez et al., 2003). we clearly saw an increase
in gfp∷lgg-1 fluorescence in cells of cup-5(zu223) embryos
compared to those laid by wild-type or cup-5(ar465) embryos at

embryos are at the e16 or the “1.5-fold” stage of development. arrows indicate lin-12 staining of the intestinal primordial cells. note that only cells in the right
primordium express lin-12 at this stage. furthermore, the pattern of lin-12 expression changes markedly during the e16 stage due to lin-12 downregulation in

the same stage of development (fig. 4a). the gfp∷lgg-1
fluorescence in cells of cup-5(ar465) embryos was slightly
more pronounced than those laid by wild-type embryos (fig.
4a). this result indicates that autophagy is activated in many
cup-5(zu223) embryonic cells. the gfp∷lgg-1 often co-
localized with lysotracker red (fig. 4a). the yolk degradation
defect of cup-5 mutant embryos is likely the cause of the
activation of autophagy since reducing the amount of yolk
available to wild-type embryonic cells after rnai of rme-2,
the yolk receptor, or rme-1, an eh-domain protein required for
the recycling of rme-2 to the plasma membrane, resulted in
more punctate gfp∷lgg-1 fluorescence (fig. 4b) (grant and
hirsh, 1999; grant et al., 2001).
one prediction from these results is that cup-5(ar465) worms
would rely more on autophagy for their survival. we reasoned
that the slight reduction in cup-5 activity may result in a partial
defect in lysosome biogenesis and hence a requirement for
autophagy to provide enough nutrients for development. we
therefore used rnai to reduce the levels of two autophagy
proteins, worm orf t22h9.2 that is the homologue of the
conserved yeast atg9p/apg9p, and worm orf f41e6.13/tag-
283 that is the homologue of the yeast atg18p and human
wipi-1α (melendez et al., 2003; noda et al., 2000; proikas-
cezanne et al., 2004). studies in yeast have shown that atg18p
is required for the recycling of atg9p from a pre-autophago-
somal compartment (reggiori et al., 2004). indeed, we found
that cup-5(ar465) embryonic viability is slightly, but reproduc-
ibly, hypersensitive to rnai of these two genes (fig. 4c). we
confirmed these results using an existing null allele of tag-283:
the average embryonic lethality was 7.14 ± 2.78 for tag-283
(gk378) and 18.66 ± 8 for cup-5(ar465); tag-283(gk378).
significantly, and contrary to the cup-5(ar465) single mutant,
the ced-3(n717); cup-5(ar465) double mutant did not show
increased embryonic lethality, compared to ced-3(n717) single
mutants, after rnai of these autophagy genes (fig. 4c). this
suggests that the main consequence of starvation is a ced-3-

mediated apoptotic response leading to lethality of some of the

suppression of starvation defects by elevating atp levels in
embryos lacking cup-5
we provided the cells with methylpyruvate, a membrane-
permeable tca substrate. adding methylpyruvate to the
medium eliminates the requirement for the endo-lysosomal
system for uptake and processing of nutrients/yolk for energy
production. we first measured the atp levels in embryos grown
on media containing 14 mm methylpyruvate,
the highest
concentration we could provide that was not detrimental to
wild-type worms. addition of methylpyruvate raised atp levels
in cup-5(zu223) and ced-3(n717); cup-5(zu223) embryos to
wild-type levels (fig. 2d). as expected, methylpyruvate did not
388
l. schaheen et al. / developmental biology 293 (2006) 382–391
restore the ability of cup-5(zu223) embryos to degrade yolk,
rme-2, or lin-12 (figs. 2a and 3; l. schaheen and h. fares,
data not shown). furthermore, cells in cup-5 mutant embryos
grown on methylpyruvate showed reduced activation of
autophagy (small arrows in fig. 4a).
cup-5 null embryos contain extra apoptotic cells; this is
suppressed by mutations in ced-3 (fig. 4d) (hersh et al.,
2002). if this extra apoptosis is due to starvation, then we
expected that addition of methylpyruvate would reduce
apoptosis to wild-type levels. indeed, “comma” to “1 1/2
fold” stage embryos of cup-5(zu223) worms grown on
methylpyruvate showed the same level of apoptosis as in
wild-type embryos. that is, the majority of embryos did not
show tunnel staining, while occasional embryos had one
tunnel-staining nucleus (fig. 4d). we note that
this is
expected since we did not use mutations to retard engulfment
of apoptotic cells. wild-type or cup-5(ar465) embryos grown
with or without methylpyruvate showed a wild-type staining
pattern (fig. 4d). furthermore, mutations in rme-1 and rme-2
did not result in increased apoptosis even though autophagy is
activated in these embryos (fig. 4e).

rescues their viability

less than 5% of
then we would expect
we tested the extent of the rescue we could achieve if we
artificially increased atp levels in cells. if starvation is the
major cause of
that
methylpyruvate would completely rescue the viability of
cup-5 null embryos. we saw a clear increase in viability of
cup-5(zu223) embryos grown on methylpyruvate plates such
that an average of 14% of the embryos hatched (fig. 5a).
to ced-3(n717); cup-5(zu223)
furthermore, and similar
embryos grown on regular media,
the
embryos that hatched developed beyond l1 larvae and all
arrested before they became adults (fig. 5a) (hersh et al.,
2002). consistent with the model
that starvation leads to
ced-3-mediated apoptosis, we did not see an enhancement of
embryonic or larval viability of ced-3(n717); cup-5(zu223) or
of ced-4(n1162); cup-5(n3194) embryos due to methylpyr-
the
uvate (fig. 5a). methylpyruvate's enhancement of
viability of cup-5(zu223) embryos to a larger extent
than
ced-3 or ced-4 mutations is likely due to slight growth defects
these mutations (fig. 5a). the
due to the presence of
starvation-induced apoptosis is not
the major cause of the
lethality since methylpyruvate, while it restores atp levels,
only partially rescues the embryonic lethality and does not
rescue the larval lethality of cup-5(zu223) embryos.

developmental defects in embryos lacking cup-5
we asked whether there were other defects in cup-5(zu223)
embryos that could contribute to lethality. we noticed premature
activation of a pharynx-specific myo-2 promoter fused to gfp
in the presumptive pharyngeal cells of transgenic cup-5(zu223)
embryos (large arrows in fig. 4a). we therefore checked for
other developmental defects. the intestinal cells in cup-5
(zu223) embryos showed a severely disorganized intestinal
terminal web when checked by immunofluorescence micros-
copy using antibodies against the intermediate filament protein
ifb-2 (fig. 5b) (bossinger et al., 2004). this indicates that
embryos lacking cup-5 are also defective in establishing the
architecture of some tissues/organs. significantly, none of these
developmental defect are rescued by methylpyruvate and/or by
ced-3(n717) (figs. 4a and 5b).
discussion
our analysis indicates that cup-5(zu223) embryonic cells
show a retardation in the degradation of yolk proteins and of cell
surface receptors. one consequence of this defect is a decrease
in nutrient and biosynthetic compound availability that leads to
the activation of autophagy. however, autophagosomes also
require lysosomes to break down their contents. thus, cells in
cup-5(zu223) embryos are unable to utilize autophagy to
compensate for the decrease in nutrient and biosynthetic
compound availability. this is in contrast
to mutations in
rme-1 and rme-2 where there is less yolk available to embryonic
cells but where there is normal lysosomal function.
one consequence of the degradation defect is starvation
leading to ectopic apoptosis. two results indicate that
the
ectopic apoptosis due to starvation is mediated by ced-3/ced-
4. first, we show that inactivation of two autophagy genes
slightly increases the embryonic lethality of cup-5(ar465)
embryos, but not of ced-3(n717); cup-5(ar465) embryos.
second, we show that increasing atp levels in cells partially
rescues the embryonic lethality of cup-5(zu223) embryos but
has no effect on the viability of cup-5(zu223) embryos
homozygous for mutations in ced-3 or ced-4. a recent study
demonstrated that there is a physical and developmental link
between autophagy and apoptosis in c. elegans embryos
(takacs-vellai et al., 2005). these results are also consistent
with a study that showed that bax−/−bak−/− mouse cells that are
defective in apoptosis require autophagy for cell survival upon
nutrient depletion (lum et al., 2005). inactivation of autophagy
results in cell death only in the absence of growth factors.
furthermore, another recent study has shown that inactivation
of the lysosomal-associated protein lamp2 in hela cells
blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes; starving
these lamp2-negative cells results in cell death with all the
hallmarks of apoptosis (gonzalez-polo et al., 2005).
cup-5(zu223) embryos laid on methylpyruvate do not have
defects associated with starvation: [atp] is restored to wild-
type levels and there is a dramatic reduction in tunnel-staining
cells. however, there is only a modest increase in embryonic
viability and no effect on larval viability. the persistent lethality
is likely due to pleiotropic defects stemming from the
retardation in the rate of degradation of signaling receptors
and/or in the availability of biosynthetic building blocks. these
lead to developmental defects that include the disorganization
of intestinal
tissue and premature activation of a pharynx
reporter.
in these lysosomes,
we should emphasize that embryos laid by cup-5 null
late stages of
hermaphrodites only show a clear defect at
development. the most obvious defect
is in developing
intestinal cells during the endocytosis of yolk that is secreted
by all other embryonic cells into the periviteline space
(bossinger and schierenberg, 1996). this is in contrast
to
mutations in worm cathepsin l that show a lysosomal defect as
early as one-cell stage embryos (britton and murray, 2004). it is
possible that lack of cup-5 only retards lysosome biogenesis/
function.
the slow accumulation of
substrates over time further inhibits lysosomal degradation,
which is consistent with the phenotype appearing at later stages
of development. tissues with high endocytic rates and transport
to lysosomes show the most severe defects, for example,
developing intestinal cells and adult coelomocytes, scavenger
cells found in the body cavity (fares and greenwald, 2001b;
treusch et al., 2004). in addition to endocytosis rates, cup-5
function may be redundant with unrelated proteins in some
tissues and/or there may be specialized cup-5-independent
pathways of lysosome biogenesis in some tissues and/or stages
of development. for example, while cup-5 is expressed in
most
tissues in adult worms, only coelomocytes show an
obvious defect in their lysosomes (fares and greenwald, 2001b;
treusch et al., 2004).
fig. 6. model of lethality in the absence of cup-5. the absence of cup-5 leads
to a defect in lysosomal degradation. the inability to degrade nutrients results in
reduced atp production, which activates ced-3-mediated apoptosis and hence
in approximately a 10–20% drop in embryonic viability. the main reasons for
embryonic and larval lethality are the developmental defects, exemplified by a
thicker arrow, which lead to cell death that is mediated by unknown factors x.

we favor a model in which the lysosomal defect due to the
absence of cup-5 results in starvation, due to the inability to
degrade yolk, and to pleiotropic developmental defects because
of a general defect in the degradation of endocytosed material
(fig. 6). lysosomal defects have previously been linked to
developmental abnormalities. for example, studies of the late
endosomal protein hrs in drosophila melanogaster have shown
the importance of lysosomal degradation of growth factor
receptors for normal embryonic development (jekely and rorth,
2003; lloyd et al., 2002). furthermore, mutating the mouse
lysosomal acid phosphatase gene results in disruption of the
cytoarchitecture of cerebellar neurons and of hair follicles
(mannan et al., 2004). the starvation defect results in ced-3/
ced-4-mediated cell death. both defects contribute to
embryonic lethality. furthermore, the larval lethality is almost
completely due to the developmental defects such that when
embryos lacking cup-5 hatch, either due to the presence of ced-
3 or ced-4 mutations or by adding methylpyruvate to the
medium, they do not develop further. these results indicate that
supplementing the energy requirements is not sufficient
to
ensure the proper development of cells and the modeling of
tissues.
the contribution of starvation and developmental defects to
the cell and neuron degeneration in mucolipidosis type iv
patients is not known and may vary among cell types. we
propose that supplementing the diet of these mucolipidosis
type iv or other “lysosomal storage disease” patients (or of
pregnant mothers with affected fetuses) with metabolites that
that are
can be pumped directly into the cytoplasm or
membrane-permeable may rescue some of
the cell death
phenotypes and give partial suppression of the symptoms
(vellodi, 2005). such a treatment would not alleviate the
symptoms due to viable cells with defective lysosome
biogenesis or to cell death due to developmental defects. the
latter require a better understanding of the exact function of h-
mucolipin-1/cup-5 in this process and the identification of
suppressors/treatments that restore lysosomal function.
