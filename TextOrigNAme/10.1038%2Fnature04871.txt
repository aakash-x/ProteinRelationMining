hypoxia signalling in cancer and approaches 
to enforce tumour regression
jacques pouysségur1, frédéric dayan1 & nathalie m. mazure1
tumour cells emerge as a result of genetic alteration of signal circuitries promoting cell growth and 
survival, whereas their expansion relies on nutrient supply. oxygen limitation is central in controlling 
neovascularization, glucose metabolism, survival and tumour spread. this pleiotropic action is orchestrated 
by hypoxia-inducible factor (hif), which is a master transcriptional factor in nutrient stress signalling. 
understanding the role of hif in intracellular ph (phi) regulation, metabolism, cell invasion, autophagy and 
cell death is crucial for developing novel anticancer therapies. there are new approaches to enforce necrotic 
cell death and tumour regression by targeting tumour metabolism and phi-control systems.
we have learned, over the past two decades, how mammalian cells 
perceive signals to induce cell-cycle progression, proliferation and 
survival. two major pathways that are frequently mutated in human 
cancer, the ras–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)1–3 and the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-oh kinase (pi(3)k)–akt4 (see the review 
in this issue by shaw and cantley, page 424) signalling cascades, are 
activated by a vast array of growth factor polypeptides, hormones and 
extracellular matrix proteins5. activation of these two pathways is suf-
ficient to trigger multiple cycles of division and survival of normal cells 
under the ‘rich’ conditions of tissue culture. in vivo, however, grow-
ing cells must constantly instruct the microenvironment to maintain 
a supply of essential nutrients. it is remarkable that the ras–erk and 
pi(3)k–akt pathways also control the expression of the ubiquitous 
vascular endothelial growth factor-a (vegf-a), which is a key factor 
in vascularization/angiogenesis6,7. during embryonic development or 
in the context of tumour expansion, growing cells rapidly outstrip the 
supply of nutrients. although cells sense and respond to variations in 
concentrations of all nutrients, oxygen sensing has emerged as a central 
control mechanism of vasculogenesis8,9.
at the heart of this regulatory system is hif10,11, which controls, 
among other gene products, the expression of two key angiogenic fac-
tors: vegf-a12 and angiopoietin-2 (ang-2)13. this finding has placed 
the hypoxia-signalling pathway at the forefront of nutritional control 
— a notion reinforced by the fact that growth factors enhance hif 
expression and converge with hypoxia in inducing maximal expression 
of vegf-a.
hif can induce a vast array of gene products controlling energy 
metabolism, neovascularization, survival, phi and cell migration, and 
has become recognized as a strong promoter of tumour growth14. this 
pro-oncogenic feature is only one facet of the dual action of hif. besides 
being a ‘guardian’ of oxygen homeostasis, hif is capable of inducing 
pro-apoptotic genes14 leading to autophagy and cell death, which can 
be features of hypoxic tissues. in this regard, hif can be likened to p53, 
which has dual roles as a guardian of genome integrity and a promoter 
of apoptosis. 
in this review we highlight the most recently revealed features of 
hypoxia signalling, and the role of hif as a master gene controlling nutri-
tional stress, angiogenesis, tumour metabolism, invasion and autophagy/
cell death. finally, we discuss potential new and exciting approaches to 
enforce tumour regression by exploiting the emerging basic knowledge 
of tumour metabolism, autophagy and cell death. 
regulating angiogenesis with vegf-a and angiopoietin-2
growth factors and hypoxia converge in the regulation of key angiogenic 
genes. the cellular expansion of tumours progressively distances cells 
from the vasculature, and thus from oxygen and nutrients. tumour cells, 
like growing embryonic cells, send out signals that initiate the formation 
of new blood vessels. this adaptive process, termed angiogenesis, is a 
general feature of every tissue; however, it is often exacerbated in solid 
tumours. thus, new tumour vessels showing structural malformations, 
chaotic blood flow and local regions of hypoxia might nonetheless pre-
vail. although many molecules and receptors have been characterized 
in this biological process, at least two factors seem critical for initiating 
vessel sprouting. these are vegf-a15,16 and ang-2 (ref. 17), which are 
two receptor ligands expressed and secreted in response to hypoxia. 
vegf-a is expressed in most cells, and attracts and guides sprout-
ing neovessels into oxygen-depleted regions of the tumour mass18,19. 
endothelial cells situated at the tip of the sprouts sense and navigate 
through the environment using long filopodia that are rich in vegf 
receptor-2 (vegfr-2)19. thus, migration of the tip cells is guided by 
a graded distribution of vegf-a, particularly the long spliced forms 
that are retained in the extracellular matrix.
although in hypoxia the binding of hif to the vegf promoter is a 
key determinant in its expression, two other major transcriptional 
controls are mediated through the ras–erk and pi(3)k–akt path-
ways6,20 (fig. 1a). vegf-a messenger rna is upregulated by the erk 
pathway through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor sp1 
and its recruitment to the proximal region of the vegf promoter21 (fig. 
1a). this regulation is independent of hypoxic stress and reflects the 
intensity of growth-factor stimulation or oncogenic signals. transcrip-
tional activation also occurs through erk-induced phosphorylation of 
hif-1α22 and the coactivator p300, which might improve the accessibility 
of rna polymerase ii to the vegf promoter. other levels of regulation 
of vegf-a occur, including the stabilization of the mrna through the 
stress-activated kinase p38 (ref. 23), and translation by means of internal 
ribosome entry site (ires) sequences present in 5´ non-coding regions 
of vegf-a24 and hif-1α mrnas25, which are two important attributes 
for translation of vegf-a under nutrient deprivation. this is another

point of convergence between growth factors and hypoxia signalling at 
the level of translation. as a ‘survival’ cytokine, vegf-a is translated 
under conditions where the cell’s general translational machinery is 
turned off. 
the second molecule induced by hypoxia is ang-2, a receptor lig-
and restricted to endothelial cells17,26 that allows vessel remodelling by 
antagonizing the related molecule ang-1. as shown in fig. 1b, ang-1,

figure 1 | vegf-a and angiopoietin-2 are key angiogenic factors induced 
by hypoxia.  a, control of vascular endothelial growth factor-a (vegf-a) 
expression. vegf-a expression is controlled at three levels: transcription, 
messenger rna stability and translation. the ras–mek–extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway stimulates transcription through 
phosphorylation of the transcription factors sp1 and hypoxia-inducible 
factor-1α (hif-1α) subunit, and their recruitment to the vegf promoter. 
the transcription factor activator protein-1 (ap-1) might also modulate 
vegf transcription. hif-1 is a heterodimer of a hypoxia-stabilized and 
activated α-subunit and an oxygen-insensitive β-subunit. vegf-a mrna 
is stabilized through the stress-activated kinase p38, and the translation 
of vegf-a is ensured under hypoxic and nutrient-depleted conditions 
by means of internal ribosome entry site (ires) sequences. under these 
energy-reduced conditions, classic cap-dependent translation is inhibited. 
b, vegf-a and angiopoietin-2 (ang-2) are two angiogenic factors induced 
by hypoxia. blood capillaries are maintained in a mature and dormant state 
through the recruitment of pericytes (pc) through platelet-derived growth 
factor-b (pdgf-b) and the signalling of the endothelial receptor tie-2 upon 
ang-1 binding. in addition, activation of the notch pathway through cyclin 
d/cdk4 and retinoblastoma protein (prb) phosphorylation contributes to 
the quiescence of endothelial cells. ang-2 is an antagonist ligand for tie-2 in 
endothelial cells and, like vegf-a, is induced under low oxygen conditions 
through the hif. the initiation of sprouting angiogenesis requires the 
destabilization of capillaries. this action is mediated by ang-2, thereby 
blocking tie-2 signalling and allowing vegf-a-induced cell migration and 
division. mapk, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
maturation of blood capillaries. these capillary endothelial cells are 
rendered quiescent through the activation of the notch pathway28, thus 
becoming unresponsive to vegf-a action, unless ang-2 is also secreted, 
leading to vessel destabilization. ang-2 is a natural ang-1 antagonist, 
which displaces ang-1 from its receptor thus arresting tie-2 signalling. 
therefore ang-2 secretion from weibel–palade bodies29 is a critical, 
and perhaps limiting, step in angiogenesis permitting vessel remodel-
ling upon vegf-a action. it is remarkable that this angiogenic ‘couple’ 
— vegf-a and ang-2 — is expressed under hypoxic control when 
and where nutrients are needed. however, the precise mechanism of 
regulation of ang-2 expression in hypoxia remains to be defined.
a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis
more than a decade ago, semenza and colleagues showed that the 
nuclear factor hif binds to the epo gene and induces its transcription 
in hypoxia10. hif is now known to induce many genes involved in the 
response to hypoxia14,30. hif was shown in vitro, in a variety of cell-
culture systems, to be activated at a cut-off point of about 5% oxygen 
(40 mmhg), and to progressively increase its activity with a decrease 
in oxygen gradient down to 0.2–0.1% oxygen (1.6–0.8 mmhg), close 
to anoxia. hif belongs to the large family of basic-helix–loop–helix 
(bhlh) proteins and is a heterodimer of a constitutively expressed and 
stable hif-1β subunit, and one of three oxygen-regulated hif-α sub-
units (hif-1α, hif-2α or hif-3α). hif activation is a multi-step process 
involving hif-α stabilization, nuclear translocation, heterodimerization, 
transcriptional activation and interaction with other proteins (see refs 31, 
32 for reviews). in the nucleus, hif binds to so-called hypoxia-response 
elements (hres), with the minimal core sequence 5´-rcgtg-3´, which 
are adjacent to auxiliary motifs specifying the responsive genes (about 
100 genes have now been characterized). yet identifying exactly how hif 
becomes activated in hypoxia has been challenging.
hif does not directly sense variations in oxygen tension (po2). the key 
regulation is orchestrated by a class of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent and 
iron-dependent dioxygenases belonging to the largest known family of 
non-haem oxidizing enzymes (ec 1.14.11.2). because the activity of 
these enzymes is strictly dependent on the cellular po2, they are the true 
oxygen-sensing molecules controlling the hypoxic response33. two types 
of oxygen sensor control hif action. the first are referred to as prolyl 
hydroxylase domain (phd) proteins34–36. phds hydroxylate two prolyl 
residues (p402 and/or p564) in the human hif-1α region referred to as 
the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (oddd; fig. 2). this hif-α 
modification specifies rapid interaction with the tumour-suppressor 
protein von hippel–lindau (vhl), a component of an e3 ubiquitin 
ligase complex37,38. subsequently, hif-α subunits become marked with 
polyubiquitin chains that drive them to destruction by the proteasomal 
system39,40. hif-1α, in well-oxygenated cells (21% o2), displays one of 
the shortest half-lives (<5 min) among cellular proteins40. of the three 
phd isoforms in humans, phd2 is the key limiting enzyme target-
ing hif-1α for degradation under normoxic conditions41, whereas the 
physiological roles of phd1 and phd3, which are active under chronic 
hypoxia, remain to be investigated (see ref. 33 for a review).
the second type of oxygen sensor controlling the hypoxic response 
is an asparaginyl hydroxylase, referred to as factor inhibiting hif-1 
(fih)42. this enzyme hydroxylates an asparagine residue (n803) in the 
most carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (c-tad) of 
human hif-1α. this covalent modification abrogates c-tad interac-
tion with transcriptional co-activators, such as p300 and its paralogue 
cbp (fig. 2). thus, the two metabolic sensors, phd2 and fih, by con-
trolling both the destruction and inactivation of hif-α subunits, ensure 
full repression of the hif pathway in well-oxygenated cells. an intrigu-
ing feature of hif-α subunits is the occurrence of apparently ‘bicephal-
ous’ transcriptional activation domains (amino (n)-tad and c-tad). 
interestingly, only c-tad, which interacts with p300/cbp, is subjected 
to hydroxylation and inhibition by fih. we propose that n-tad and 
c-tad could discriminate between the induction of different hypoxic 
genes, as deletion of c-tad in a naturally occurring spliced form of 
hif-1α retains one-third of the transcriptional activity43.

in a model describing the microenvironment of a blood vessel (fig. 3), 
we propose that cells exposed to a decreasing oxygen gradient will first 
express a subset of genes regulated by n-tad, followed by a second 
subset of genes regulated by c-tad at lower oxygen concentrations. 
this model integrates the interesting finding that phds have a much 
lower affinity for oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate than fih44. therefore, if 
this notion applies in vivo, phds will be inactivated at oxygen values 
that still maintain fih activity and therefore keep c-tad under repres-
sion. this model is supported by the existence of at least two classes of 
hif-dependent gene: those that are sensitive and non-sensitive to the 
activity of fih45. thus, the two tads, together with the oxygen-sensitive 
discriminator fih, constitute a cellular device that allows fine-tuning 
of specific hif gene expression along the hypoxic gradient45. one par-
ticular hif-induced gene that seems not to be repressed by the activity 
of fih is the pro-apoptotic bnip3, a member of the bh3-only protein 
family of cell death factors46. this finding came as a surprise, because 
we were expecting that a gene inducing cell death should be maintained 
under strict and tight control, and expressed only under severe hypoxic 
conditions. the current hypothesis is that bnip3-induced cell death 
is revealed only by severe acidosis associated with deep o2 depletion47 
(fig. 3). bnip3 ‘activation’ by acidosis requires further investigation.
hif meets the mtor pathway
as well as activating angiogenesis, hypoxic stress also leads to attenua-
tion of protein synthesis by means of emerging regulatory mechanisms 
implicating the mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway.
mtor is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that phospho-
rylates a series of substrates involved in protein translation, including 
the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e-binding protein-1 (4ebp1) and 
ribo somal p70 s6 kinase (s6k)48,49. as a chief orchestrator of protein 
synthesis, the mtor pathway integrates a variety of signals. mtor is 
activated by rheb–gtp, a small g protein, itself negatively regulated 
by the gtpase activity of the tumour suppressor complex tsc2–tsc1, 
which was first identified as being mutated in patients with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (tsc)50,51 (fig. 4). the upstream activators of mtor

of hif-1α.  the transcription factor hif (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a 
member of the basic-helix–loop–helix perarntsim (bhlh–pas) family 
of proteins with two pas domains, a and b. hif is a heterodimer of an 
oxygen-sensitive α-subunit and an oxygen-insensitive β-subunit. two 
oxygen sensors termed prolyl-hydroxylase domain (phd) protein and 
factor inhibiting hif-1 (fih) determine, respectively, the stability and 
activity of hif-1α. the phds, by hydroxylating two proline residues (402 
and 564) in a region called the oxygen-dependent degradation domain 
(oddd), initiate the binding of a component of an e3 ubiquitin ligase, the 
von hippel–lindau (vhl) protein, which marks hif-1α for destruction 
by the proteasome. fih, by hydroxylating an asparagine residue in the 
carboxy-terminal transcriptional activation domain (c-tad) of hif-1α, 
inhibits the binding of cofactors, such as p300, that are required for the 
transcription of certain hif-dependent genes. a second transcriptional 
activation domain, n-tad, which overlaps the oddd, is fih independent 
and might be implicated in distinct gene expression.

figure 3 | working model of two sets of hif-1-regulated genes.  in the 
tissue microenvironment, cells situated at various distances from blood 
capillaries will experience different oxygen tensions (po2), as illustrated by 
a decreasing gradient. a parallel increase in the extracellular acidity due to 
the accumulation of lactate and co2 is noted as cells become more distant 
from capillaries. hypoxia induces the expression of carbonic anhydrase 
ix (ca ix), which helps to retain a relatively neutral intracellular ph. 
the expression of the proapoptotic protein bnip-3 is induced under 
moderately hypoxic conditions, but requires acidosis to promote cell 
death. thus, under the extreme conditions of low po2 and acidosis, necrotic 
areas are often visible. a decreasing po2 gradient from the blood vessel to 
the tumour core will also determine the activity of the prolyl hydroxylase 
domain (phd) proteins and factor inhibiting hif-1 (fih). the michaelis 
constant (km) of the phd proteins and fih predict that the former has a 
lower affinity for oxygen and is therefore more rapidly inhibited than the 
latter. so, at a moderate po2, hif-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) will 
be stable because the phd proteins are inhibited, but genes dependent 
on carboxy-terminal transcription activation domain (c-tad) activity 
will not be induced because c-tad inhibition is maintained by fih 
activity. however, genes requiring only the amino-terminal transcription 
activation domain (n-tad) will be induced. as the po2 decreases further, 
the inhibition of c-tad will be released and hif-1α will attain full 
transcriptional activity. in this way the ‘bicephalous’ transcriptional 
nature of hif-1α will, in an fih-dependent or fih-independent manner, 
differentially regulate two sets of genes.
are myriad growth factors, hormones and extracellular matrix compo-
nents known to promote cell growth and survival through activation of 
the pi(3)k–akt and ras–erk cardinal pathways. all these activators 
converge at the level of the tsc2–tsc1 integrator complex. direct phos-
phorylation of tsc2, by either akt (see the review in this issue by shaw 
and cantley, page 424) or erks52, inhibits its intrinsic gtpase activity 
leading to mtor activation. interestingly, nutrients (amino acids and 
glucose) also inhibit the tsc2–tsc1 complex through a mechanism 
that has not been fully resolved, which results in activation of protein 
synthesis53,54. translation of hif-1α has been found to be particularly 
sensitive to growth factors that activate mtor55,56.
in contrast to these multiple mtor-activation inputs, mtor, and 
therefore protein synthesis, is shut down under stress conditions 
generated by energy depletion or hypoxia (fig. 4). in response to an 
increase in the amp:atp ratio, the upstream kinase lkb1 phospho-
rylates and activates amp-activated protein kinase (ampk)57. once 
activated, ampk phosphorylates several downstream substrates, 
resulting in a decrease in energy demand by switching off atp-con-
suming pathways58. direct phosphorylation of tsc2 by ampk leads 
to activation of the tsc2–tsc1 complex and subsequent mtor 
inhibition. hif/hypoxia negatively regulates mtor in two ways:

figure 4 | hypoxia meets the mtor pathway.  the blue arrows in the left 
and central parts of this diagram denote the converging pathways activating 
mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) at the level of the tumour 
suppressor complex (tsc2–tsc1). mtor, which is sensitive to rapamycin, 
controls protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of 4e-binding 
protein-1 (4ebp1) and p70 s6 kinase (s6k). growth factors, through akt-
dependent and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)-dependent 
phosphorylation, suppress the gtpase activity of the tsc complex, leading 
to full activation of gtp–rheb, which is the activator of the mtor–raptor 
complex. nutrients and growth factors cooperate in the optimal activation 
of this pathway, which is essential for relaying growth and survival signals. 
by contrast, depletion of nutrients or energy (amino acids, atp or oxygen) 
inhibits mtor through independent activation of the tsc complex (red 
arrows). suppression of mtor in response to hypoxia requires gene 
induction (redd1), whereas a decrease in atp rapidly shuts down mtor 
by activation of the amp kinase (ampk), thereby directly phosphorylating 
tsc2. the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of mtor favours the concomitant 
induction of pro-apoptotic bnip3 and macro-autophagy, which are two 
processes that are often associated with necrotic cell death in tumours.

first, hypoxia inhibits mtor by an increase in amp, leading to the 
activation of ampk59; and second, a more direct link between hif 
and mtor was established in drosophila, in which the hif-induced 
paralogue gene products, scylla and charybdis (redd1/rtp801 
in mammals), activate the tsc complex resulting in mtor inhibi-
tion60,61. therefore, hypoxia, through two independent mechanisms 
— ampk activation and hif-induced redd1 — suppresses mtor 
activity (fig. 4). these restricted nutrient conditions associated with 
low mtor activity favour rapid activation of macro-autophagy, which 
is the ultimate survival process before cell death62. we believe that 
the rapid induction of bnip3 in a hypoxic microenvironment con-
tributes to cell survival via autophagy up to a point of no return, in 
which severe acidic areas induce necrotic cell death by means of a 
bnip3-dependent action47,63. human tumour cells often silence, by 
promoter methylation, the expression of bnip3 (ref. 64). whether 
this bnip3 ablation allows tumour cells to invade, metastasize and 
resist this nutrition-deprived and hypoxia-induced cell death requires 
further investigation65.
from hypoxia to tumour invasion
hypoxia, or genetic alterations of the hypoxia signalling cascade66,67 
leading to the constitutive expression of hif, could promote intense and 
chaotic neovascularization that facilitates tumour spread. 
it has now been firmly established that hif has important roles in 
tumour progression. several immunohistochemical analyses have indi-
cated that hif-1α and hif-2α are overexpressed in primary and meta-
static human cancers, and that the level of expression, either as a result of 
tumour hypoxia or genetic alterations, is correlated with tumour angio-
genesis and patient mortality14,67. tumour progression and invasion 
are often associated with the increased capacity of the cells to promote 
extracellular matrix remodelling, increased migration and digestion of 
the basement membrane. are these key features of cancer cells regulated 
by hif? from the myriad genes induced by hif, only a limited set of 
gene products possesses this potential. this group includes vimentin, 
fibronectin, keratins 14, 18 and 19, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp2), 
cathepsin d and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (upar)14. 
other factors promoting migration can be added to this list, such as the 
autocrine motility factor (amf)68, the receptor tyrosine kinase c-met69 
and the cytokine receptor cxcr4 (ref. 70; fig. 5).
another landmark of invasion and a crucial feature of epithelium–
mesenchyme transition (emt) is the loss of e-cadherin expression71. 
interestingly, hypoxia and genetic lesions (vhl deletion in renal cell car-
cinoma) leading to hif activation are associated with a concomitant 
loss of e-cadherin. after its proposal in 1999 (ref. 72), the first evidence 
linking hif to decreased expression of e-cadherin was demonstrated 
in ovarian carcinoma: immunolocalization of nuclear hif-1α showed a 
strong topological correlation with loss of e-cadherin73. another immu-
nological study in early genetic lesions in kidney showed concomitant 
expression of carbonic anhydrase ix (ca ix), an hif-dependent gene 
product, with loss of e-cadherin74. the intriguing question is how 
hypoxia represses e-cadherin. e-cadherin is controlled at the tran-
scriptional level by the labile nuclear factor family, snail/slug71, so that 
any situation leading to snail/slug activation will repress e-cadherin. 
an unexpected link has just emerged in a class of secreted enzymes, 
the lysyl oxidase family (lox), which is known to modify extracellular 
matrix components75 but also to have some intracellular function, such 
as activation of snail. two key lysine residues, k98 and k137, of snail 
have been found to be essential in a loxl2-induced conformational 
change that renders snail partly immune to glycogen synthase kinase-β3 
(gsk-β3)-induced degradation76. interestingly, high expression of lox 
and loxl2 was previously reported only in breast cancer cells with a 
highly invasive metastatic phenotype77. in a separate study, stable abla-
tion of lox by short-hairpin rna (shrna) in the mda-231 breast 
cancer line reduced lung and liver metastasis in mice bearing orthotopic 
tumours78. perhaps the most exciting and relevant finding for this dis-
cussion is that lox is highly induced by hif-1 (refs 30, 79), therefore 
establishing the missing link in this new molecular cascade of hypoxia 
signalling and metastasis: hif–lox–snail–e-cadherin (fig. 5). besides 
this predicted cascade, an alternative mechanism in renal cell carcinoma 
has been proposed in which hif-1 could alter the mrna levels of the 
e-cadherin repressors tcf3, zfhx1a and zfhx1b80.
approaches to enforcing tumour regression
a strong correlation between hif-1α expression and increased patient 
mortality is well documented for many types of human cancer. in 
tumour-xenograft and orthotopic mouse models, manipulation of 
the levels of either hif-1α or hif-2α has demonstrated a causal link 
between hif-α expression and tumour progression14. perhaps the best 
example concerns the renal cell carcinoma line 786-0, lacking vhl, in 
which it was elegantly demonstrated that hif-2α expression was indeed 
causal for tumour growth81. along this line, it is interesting to note the role 
of hif-2α in promoting cancer stem cells by specific octamer-binding 
transcription factor 4 (oct-4) induction82. collectively, these findings 
suggest that hif, a promoter of early invasive lesions, is a promising 
therapeutic target in cancer. a lot of effort has been put into identifying 
molecules that successfully inhibit hif-1α expression and/or activity83. 
however, the pleiotypic action of hif could represent a major con-
cern with such an approach. it might be more appropriate to identify 
and target the key gene products specifying hif-dependent invasion 
and tumour metabolism. the first good example of targeting an hif-

figure 5 | hypoxia-induced loss of e-cadherin through the lysyl oxidase–
snail activation pathway.  cell migration from the primary tumour and 
invasion into adjacent connective tissue are two steps leading to metastasis 
in carcinomas. invasion requires a proteolytic modification of the 
extracellular matrix (ecm), migration and loss of cell–cell adhesion. 
a, hypoxia-inducible factor (hif) induces markers that activate proteolysis, 
including cathepsin d, urokinase-type plasminogen-activator receptor 
(upar) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp2), and factors stimulating 
migration such as phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine-motility factor 
(pgi/amf), transforming growth factor-α (tgf-α) and the spreading 
factor c-met. epithelial–mesenchymal transition is also considered to be 
a trait of tumour cell invasion and is associated with a downregulation of 
epithelial cadherin (e-cadherin), which is essential for maintaining cell–cell 
adhesion. normal epithelial cells lie on a basement membrane that makes 
contact with the ecm. b, under low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia), hif is 
active and induces the expression of lysyl oxidase (lox). a member of the 
same family, loxl2, was found to activate the transcription factor snail, 
which is a strong repressor of e-cadherin. this pathway might account for 
the invasion and metastatic process induced by hypoxia. 
dependent gene product is the anti-vegf-a therapeutic strategy84. 
major advances have been reported recently in the treatment of meta-
static colon and renal cancers with this anti-angiogenic approach, and 
others, such as targeting ang-2 (ref. 85), are likely to follow.
however, every success story has its drawbacks. the concern about 
anti-angiogenic therapy is the inherent selection of cancer cells that adapt 
to more hypoxic conditions and, in particular, to tumour acidosis, which 
is a hallmark of anaerobic glycolysis86,87. what new approaches can we 
propose to anticipate and counteract this drawback? in solid tumours, 
immunohistochemistry often shows large fronts of hif-1α nuclear 
expression delineating areas of necrosis. how can we magnify and

as a result of the overproduction of lactic and carbonic acids. to survive 
and proliferate, cells must extrude these acids and maintain a balance 
between the extracellular and phi) through the activity of several pumps, 
exchangers and transporters. intracellular h+ ions are primarily extruded 
through the growth-factor-activatable and amiloride-sensitive na+/h+ 
exchanger (nhe-1; target 1). lactic acid is excreted from cells by members 
of the h+/lactate co-transporter family (monocarboxylate transporters 
(mcts) 1–4; target 2). metabolically generated co2 diffuses rapidly across 
the plasma membrane and meets the membrane-bound ectoenzyme 
carbonic anhydrase ix (ca ix) or ca xii, which converts it into carbonic 
acid (target 3). uptake of the weak base hco3

glucose transporter-1; hif-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1.
– via a member of the na+-
– exchangers contributes to 
accelerate necrotic cell death in tumours? although tumour cells have 
selected many mechanisms to escape and resist programmed cell death, 
they cannot avoid atp depletion-induced necrosis. several steps must be 
combined to enforce necrotic cell death in tumours: the first is to magnify 
acidosis by increased anaerobic glycolysis, the second is to antagonize phi 
regulation and the third might be to stop macro-autophagy. 
the first of these steps can be conveyed through anti-angiogenic 
treatment, which is the best way to enforce tumour hypoxia and hif-1 
expression, and to stimulate the production of lactic acid and co2 in 
the tumour. 
for the second step, we need to identify the key phi-regulating sys-
tems to be antagonized (representative examples are outlined in fig. 6). 
hypoxic tumour cells in particular ‘learn’ how to counteract local acido-
sis, which is a major constraint in protein synthesis and cell growth. 
they induce, through hif-1α membrane-bound ectoenzymes, ca ix 
or ca xii, which catalyse the hydration of co2 to bicarbonate88. the 
rapidly formed bicarbonate is pumped in by a member of the ubiquitous 
bicarbonate/cl– exchanger family89, leading to cellular alkalinization 
and subsequent acidification of the extracellular milieu, to the benefit 
of the cell. two additional key transporters, extruding h+ from the cell, 
are the lactate/h+ symporters, in particular monocarboxylate trans-
porter-4 (mct-4) induced by hif-1 (refs 90, 91), and the growth factor 
and amiloride-sensitive na+/h+ exchanger (nhe1)92,93. preliminary 
experiments conducted with ras-transformed fibroblasts deleted in 
nhe1, in glycolysis (pgi–) or in both, have established proof of principle 
for tumour regression by manipulating tumour acidosis94. tumour cells 
lacking nhe1 showed a drastic reduction in tumour incidence unless 
the production of lactic acid was genetically suppressed94. an ideal

translation of this concept to tumour therapy would be to associate 
specific inhibitors for nhe1 (cariporide), bicarbonate/cl– exchangers 
(s3705)95, mct-1 lactate/h+ symporter96 and/or blockers of carbonic 
anhydrases (acetazolamide). 
the third step to accelerate tumour necrosis might be to suppress, in 
combination with other treatments, macro-autophagy97, which is a proc-
ess commonly induced by hypoxia and representing the ‘ultimate’ nutri-
tional source for tumour cells to survive low-nutrient conditions98. we 
expect that this ‘phi-targeted’ therapy, combined with anti-angiogenesis 
to increase hypoxia-mediated acidosis, will synergistically induce the 
collapse and massive shrinkage of solid tumours. 
preclinical studies exploiting the inducible expression of shrna 
together with the above-mentioned drugs in tumour mouse models 
should lead to the following: the identification of the best molecular 
hif-dependent targets to suppress; the recognition of the best associa-
tions of drugs targeting tumour metabolism; and the definition of the 
most appropriate therapeutic windows.
concluding remarks and perspectives
the hif signalling cascade has emerged as an important nutrient-driven 
genomic response allowing tumour cells to survive, expand and invade. 
as a result, tumour hypoxia or hif expression is strongly associated 
with a diminished therapeutic response and malignant progression99. 
we should therefore consider systematically assessing by immuno-
histochemistry both hif-1α/2α and e-cadherin expression in biopsies 
of patients presenting with early tumour lesions. detecting an early 
marker of potential malignity and identifying patients at risk would be a 
step forward for clinicians, but cannot be compared with a cure. drugs 
targeting hif-1 will be available soon and there is no doubt that they 
will have important clinical applications14,83. however, in inflammatory 
cells, hif-1 serves a key function in energy metabolism and its blockade 
results in severe immunodeficiency100. thus, as discussed for nuclear 
factor-κb (nf-κb; see the review in this issue by karin, page 431), pro-
longed and prominent inhibition of hif-1 is unlikely to be proposed in 
cancer prevention. alternatively, as emphasized in this review, it seems 
more appropriate to target the most relevant hif-induced gene products/
functions of the tumour microenvironment. we strongly believe that the 
singularities of tumour metabolism will serve as a source of inspiration 
for developing novel cancer therapeutic approaches.
although the biology of hypoxia signalling has progressed rapidly, 
and many of the hif-induced gene products have been characterized, 
their exact functions within the tumour microenvironment remain to be 
determined. new exciting areas in hif signalling that intercept with the 
nf-κb response and inflammation101, cell differentiation, notch signal-
ling102 and stem cell auto-renewal82 are blowing fresh oxygen into this 
area of cancer biology.
