mammals survive starvation by activating proteolysis and lipolysis in many different tissues. these
responses are triggered, at least in part, by changing hormonal and neural statuses during starvation.
pathways of proteolysis that are activated during starvation are surprisingly diverse, depending on tissue
type and duration of starvation. the ubiquitin-proteasome system is primarily responsible for increased
skeletal muscle protein breakdown during starvation. however, in most other tissues, lysosomal path-
ways of proteolysis are stimulated during fasting. short-term starvation activates macroautophagy,
whereas long-term starvation activates chaperone-mediated autophagy. lipolysis also increases in re-
sponse to starvation, and the breakdown of triacylglycerols provides free fatty acids to be used as an
energy source by skeletal muscle and other tissues. in addition, glycerol released from triacylglycerols
can be converted to glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. during long-term starvation, oxidation of free
fatty acids by the liver leads to the production of ketone bodies that can be used for energy by skeletal
muscle and brain. tissues that cannot use ketone bodies for energy respond to these small molecules by
activating chaperone-mediated autophagy. this is one form of interaction between proteolytic and
lipolytic responses to starvation. © 2006 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.

introduction
throughout evolution organisms have had to adapt to
oscillating conditions in nutrient availability. decreases in
nutrients lead to cellular responses that maintain cellular
energy levels so that the organism is able to recover from
starvation [1,2]. responses to starvation in higher eu-
karyotes are complex and are initiated in part by hormonal
changes in response to decreasing levels of glucose and
amino acids in the blood. there are different hormones that
contribute to the physiologic responses to starvation, but we
focus on the resulting metabolic consequences. a summary
of the hormones, their changes in concentration during
fasting, the effects of these changing concentrations, and
select literature reviews can be found in table 1.
a response that all eukaryotes have to starvation is to
increase protein degradation. the proteolytic pathways
function during starvation to liberate amino acids that can
then be used to synthesize new proteins required for sur-
vival or catabolized into krebs cycle intermediates to sup-
ply cells with energy. liberated amino acids provide an
average of 4.4 kcal/g [3]. there are no specialized cells or
organelles that store protein, so normal, functional proteins
must be used to supply the amino acids.
triacylglycerols (tags) are a more concentrated energy
source, providing an average of 9.5 kcal/g [3]. many tissues
contain lipid stores, but most are stored in adipose tissue.
adipose tissue consists largely (⬎90% by weight) of the stored
lipid droplet. the catabolism of lipids generates fatty acids that
can be used directly by skeletal muscle or be further metabo-
lized to acetyl coenzyme a (coa) for use in the krebs cycle.
proteolytic pathways activated by starvation
the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ups) and two different
lysosomal pathways of proteolysis are activated in starvation.

skeletal muscle proteins during starvation. the ups medi-
ates degradation of select proteins within the cytosol or
nucleus in an adenosine triphosphate (atp)-dependent
manner and is a critical component of a number of impor-
tant cellular processes [4 –10]. table 2 presents a partial list
of known substrates for the ups. they include proteins that
are critical for cell cycle progression, gene transcription,
and growth. the ups is important for many aspects of
cellular physiology, so it should not be surprising that com-
plete inhibition of the ups is lethal to cells and organisms
[11].
ubiquitin is a 76 –amino acid polypeptide that is con-
served from yeast to mammals. ubiquitin is constitutively
expressed but can be upregulated during times of cell stress
such as during starvation and heat shock [4].
the ups requires covalent conjugation of ubiquitin mol-
ecules onto the target protein. ubiquitin molecules are con-
jugated to one another to form an ubiquitin chain that marks
the protein for degradation by the 26s proteasome. protein
ubiquitination is mediated by an enzyme cascade that in-
volves at least four classes of enzymes: an ubiquitin-acti-
vating enzyme (e1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2), a
ubiquitin-protein ligase (e3), and a ubiquitin-ubiquitin li-
gase (e4; fig. 1). multiple isoforms of many of these
enzymes exist and undoubtedly contribute to recognition of
a wide variety of different classes of protein substrates [8].
it is well known that intracellular protein degradation
requires atp [5], and several steps in the ubiquitination and
degradation of protein substrates are atp dependent. many
different laboratories have contributed to our understanding
of the mechanisms of ubiquitination, but much of the story
was discovered by avram hersko, aaron ciechanover, and
irwin rose who received the 2004 nobel prize in chemistry
for this work. a pivotal discovery showed that the protein
atp-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (apf-1) formed cova-
lent complexes with substrate proteins in an atp-dependent
manner. this conjugation promoted degradation of the pro-
tein [6]. apf-1 was identiﬁed as ubiquitin based on its
sequence identity and the fact that apf-1 and ubiquitin
were substrates for the same enzymes [7].

chaperones to fold and unfold protein substrates [19]. in
addition, the regulatory cap contains an ubiquitin isopepti-
dase that can degrade polyubiquitin chains [20]. the pro-
teasome also requires atp for its assembly [21].
there is a growing number of cell surface proteins that
are ubiquitinated and delivered to lysosomes for degrada-
tion (table 2). there are also several examples of mem-
brane proteins that can be ubiquitinated and pulled out of
the membrane during degradation by the proteasome or
delivered to lysosomes for proteolysis [22,23]. the differ-
ence between these two proteolytic fates may depend on the
number of ubiquitins attached to the protein and the lysines
to which subsequent ubiquitins are attached. for example,
ubiquitin chains consisting of more than four molecules
attached through k48 in ubiquitin provide a preferential
target to the 26s proteasome [24]. shorter ubiquitin chains
attached through k63 are efﬁciently targeted to lysosomes
[25].
the catabolism of muscle protein is essential to provid-
ing energy to the animal during short-term starvation. mus-
cle cells have the ability to degrade protein by lysosomal
and ups pathways [26,27]. however, lysosomal pathways
account for only approximately 10 –20% of total skeletal
muscle proteolysis [26,27]. in contrast, muscle wasting dur-
ing different catabolic states including starvation can be
inhibited by treatment with proteasome inhibitors [28,29].
muscle biopsies from patients undergoing weight loss have
shown an increase in expression of ubiquitin, e2 enzymes,
and subunits of the proteasome [30 –33]. further, gene ex-

fig. 2. structure and activities of the 26s proteasome. the proteasome core
consists of 14␣and 14␤subunits arranged in stacked rings. the ␣-subunits
bind to unfolded proteins, and the ␤-subunits have threonine protease
activities. a regulatory complex may bind to both ends of the proteasome
core to form the 26s proteasome. the regulatory complex contains sub-
units that bind to polyubiquitin chains and molecular chaperones that can
unfold and refold proteins. the regulatory complex also contains a ubi-
quitin isopeptidase that hydrolyzes the ubiquitin chain. atpases, adenosine
triphosphatases.
fig. 1. the ub system. in an adenosine triphosphate– dependent manner,
e1 activates ub and then transfers it to e2. e2 then transfers ub to e3,
which covalently attaches ub to the substrate. e3s work with an e4 to build
a polyubiquitin chain on the substrate protein. ubh and ubp can remove
ub from substrate proteins or degrade ub chains, respectively. e1, ubi-
quitin-activating enzyme; e2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; e3, ubi-
quitin-protein ligase; e4, ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase; ub, ubiquitin; ubh,
ubiquitin hydrolases; ubp, ubiquitin proteases.
the ﬁrst step of the cascade is activation of ubiquitin by
e1. in this step, a thiol ester bond is formed between the
reactive cysteine of e1 and the carboxyl terminal glycine of
ubiquitin in an atp-dependent manner. a similar thiol ester
bond is formed between ubiquitin and e2s [8]. in the next
step of substrate-ubiquitin conjugation, ubiquitin is trans-
ferred from an e2 to an e3 [9]. the e3 enzyme recognizes
features of the substrate protein and then forms an isopep-
tide bond between the carboxyl terminal glycine of ubi-
quitin and an ⑀-amino group of a lysine in the substrate
protein [9,10]. the amino terminal ␣-amino group can also
be ubiquitinated [12], and certain substrates that lack lysines
can be ubiquitinated on cysteines [13]. an ubiquitin-ubi-
quitin ligase, e4, contributes to forming a polyubiquitin
chain on the substrate protein. once the protein is tagged for
degradation, it is delivered to the 26s proteasome (fig. 2),
where it is degraded in an atp-dependent manner [14].
features of a protein that make it a good substrate for
ubiquitination are complex. in some cases, the amino ter-
minal amino acid is recognized by a particular e3 [15]. in
other cases, internal sequences such as the destruction box
in cyclins and in certain kinases [16] or the ken box in
other kinases and phosphatases [17] are required for their
ubiquitination.
the core of the 26s proteasome consists of four stacked
seven-membered rings (fig. 2). the ␣-subunits are able to
bind to unfolded proteins, whereas the ␤-subunits have
threonine protease activities [18]. the regulatory caps con-
tain several different atpases that can act as molecular

have indicated increased expression of ubiquitin, certain
proteasome subunits, and a particular e3 [34]. together
these data indicate that, under catabolic conditions such as
weight loss, the ups pathway is responsible for most mus-
cle proteolysis.
during this short-term starvation, insulin levels decrease
and glucocorticoids increase, which trigger skeletal muscle
cells to increase their rates of proteolysis. epinephrine also
increases during starvation, which decreases skeletal muscle
proteolysis, but the overall effect is to increase skeletal
muscle protein degradation [35]. certain amino acids that
are liberated during muscle cell proteolysis travel to the
liver, where they are converted to glucose or utilized for
energy.
increased degradation of muscle proteins during starva-
tion applies mostly to fast-twitch muscles rather than to
slow-twitch muscles [36]. however, most skeletal muscle
types show some increase in proteolysis during starvation
[36].
recently, caspase-3 has been implicated in the initial
proteolytic event that induces degradation of muscle myo-
ﬁbrils [37]. activation of caspase-3 is necessary to cleave
actomyosin/myoﬁbrils, which liberates protein fragments
that are then degraded by the ups pathway [37].
as starvation progresses the amount of total muscle
proteolysis decreases [1]. in humans the ﬁrst day of starva-
tion results in degradation of 75 g of muscle protein, but
later in starvation only 20 g of muscle protein is degraded
per day [1]. one cause of this protein-sparing effect is
activation of lipolysis (see below), which provides free fatty
acids (ffas) as an alternative fuel for muscle, liver, kidney,
and heart.
there now appears to be crosstalk between adipose tis-
sue and muscle tissue [38]. the amount of muscle protein
that is lost during the initial hours of starvation is inversely
related to the amount of total body fat within an individual.
in obese patients who are losing weight, the total amount of
muscle proteolysis is lower than in lean patients [39].
whether or not this decreased proteolysis in obese people
simply reﬂects their required increased exercise in daily
movements remains to be established.
lysosomal autophagic pathways
and
chaperone-mediated
autophagy, literally meaning “self-eating,” is made up
of several different processes including microautophagy,
macroautophagy,
autophagy
(cma), each of which requires atp [40]. these autophagic
processes function in response to external (starvation) and
internal (damaged organelles, oxidative stress, protein ag-
gregation) stimuli. in the following sections, two classes of
autophagy that increase in response to starvation are re-
viewed (fig. 3). a third lysosomal proteolytic pathway,
microautophagy, may [41] or may not [40] be activated by
starvation.
fig. 3. lysosomal pathways of proteolysis that are increased during star-
vation. macroautophagy is described in detail in the text. it is activated in
many tissues in response to short-term starvation. chaperone-mediated
autophagy is also described in detail in the text and is activated by
long-term starvation and other forms of stress. ap, autophagosome; l,
lysosome; n, nucleus.
macroautophagy
macroautophagy is the most widely studied form of
autophagy in saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian
cells. in macroautophagy there is a sequestration of a sec-
tion of cytosol that contains proteins and/or organelles by a
double membrane vesicle called an autophagosome (ap;
fig. 3). the ap then fuses with endosomes to become an
amphisome, and the amphisome subsequently fuses with
lysosomes and acquires lysosomal enzymes that degrade
internal components. in macroautophagy these internalized
components include proteins, sugars, lipids, and nucleic
acids. lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes capable of
digesting all of these compounds [42].
by taking advantage of yeast genetics, researchers have
been able to determine approximately 20 genes and proteins
necessary for macroautophagy [43]. these genes are termed
atg followed by a number, and corresponding proteins are
called atgp. the origin of the sequestering double mem-
brane has been debated for some years. some researchers
had evidence in mammalian liver that the ap membrane
originated from the endoplasmic reticulum [44,45] or the
golgi network [46], whereas other researchers maintained
that the ap membrane originated de novo from a condensed
region of the cytoplasm termed the phagophore [47]. re-
cently, a perivacuolar structure has been described as the
preautophagosome, which is where the initial step of se-
questration begins in yeast [48,49]. the preautophagosome
contains proteins and lipids necessary for the formation and
expansion of the ap. the origins of this structure are cur-
rently being deﬁned.
proteins involved in the formation of aps use two con-
jugation systems related to the ubiquitination of proteins.
one ubiquitin-like conjugation system begins with atg12p
binding to the e1-like enzyme atg7p [50 –55]. the atg7p

acids also inhibit protein degradation in skeletal muscle
[60], kidney [61], and heart [62]. in these cases, leucine and
phenylalanine alone achieve maximal inhibition in skeletal
muscle [60], leucine and glutamine are maximally effective
in kidney [61], and leucine alone shows maximum inhibi-
tion in heart [62].
target of rapamycin
leucine increases protein synthesis in liver and muscle
cells [63] and inhibits macroautophagy more potently than
any other amino acid. treating hepatocytes with amino
acids resulted in phosphorylation of the 40s ribosomal pro-
tein s6 [64]. this phosphorylation of s6 could be prevented
by treatment with the target of rapamycin (tor) inhibitor
rapamycin [65,66]. the percentage of s6 phosphorylation
was inversely related to the activity of macroautophagy
[67]. we now know that tor (mtor in mammals) inhibits
macroautophagy.
tor is a central protein on which many signaling path-
ways converge and from which many signaling pathways
emanate to sense amino acid levels, intracellular atp lev-
els, and the presence of insulin [65,66]. the signaling events
converge on mtor and ultimately lead to phosphorylation of
s6 mediated by p70s6 kinase [67]. activated mtor leads to
multiple events that eventually result in stimulating the
initiation of protein synthesis [67]. the mechanism by
which mtor signaling inhibits autophagy is unknown, but it
is clear that inhibition of tor/mtor by rapamycin activates
macroautophagy in several cell types [65– 68]. future work
should focus on determining how macroautophagy is in-
duced by the absence of mtor signaling.
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases
(pi3ks) constitute a
group of ubiquitous enzymes that phosphorylate the inositol
head group of phosphoinositides at the 3-hydroxyl position
[69] to form phosphatidyl-monophosphates, phosphatidyl-
diphosphates, or phosphatidyl-triphosphates [70].
of eight pi3ks known to exist, the class i group has been
the most extensively studied [71]. class i pi3ks are in-
volved in a multitude of cellular processes such as cell
growth and survival, insulin signaling, inﬂammation, and
immunity [71]. in contrast to the extensive knowledge on
class i pi3ks, much less is known about class ii pi3ks.
they may be especially important in regulating cell motility
[72]. in mammals there is a single class iii pi3k that is not
stimulated by receptors and plays a role in membrane traf-
ﬁcking, vacuolar sorting, and autophagy [70,73,74]. the
pi3k inhibitors, wortmannin and ly294002, inhibit auto-
phagy in isolated rat hepatocytes [75] and in other cell types
[76,77]. further support for involvement of pi3k in mac-
roautophagy is that the macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyl-
adenine is a pi3k inhibitor [47,78].
the pi3ks that are required for macroautophagy exist in
fig. 4. macroautophagy requires two forms of ubiquitin-like conjugation.
(a) protein conjugation system required for macroautophagy. atg12p is
covalently linked to atg5p through the actions of atg7p, an e1 enzyme,
and atg10p, an e2 enzyme. (b) lipid conjugation system required for
macroautophagy. atg8pr refers to atg8p that normally ends in arginine.
atgp7 is homologous to the ubiquitin activating enzyme e1. atg4p clips
off the c-terminal arginine and atg3p, an e2, catalyzes conjugation of pe
to the exposed c-terminal glycine. atp, adenosine triphosphate; e1, ubi-
quitin-activating enzyme; e2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; pe, phos-
phatidylethanolamine.
then transfers atg12p to atg10p, an e2-like enzyme
[51,52]. an atg12p-atg5p complex is then formed [53]
(fig. 4). once the atg12p-atg5p complex forms, it interacts
with atg16p, which then facilitates its multimerization [49].
the oligomerized atg12p-atg5p-atg16p can reach sizes of
350 kda in yeast and 800 kda in mammals [55]. the
atg12p-atg5p-atg16p complex is necessary for expansion
of the ap structure, but is absent in the mature ap [56]. the
function of the atg12p-atg5p-atg16p complex is unknown.
another ubiquitin-like conjugation system results in a co-
valent lipid modiﬁcation of a protein [57]. once macroau-
tophagy is activated, the carboxyl terminus of atg8p (mi-
crotubule-associated protein light chain-3 in mammals) is
cleaved by atg4p. this cleavage allows atg7p and atg3p,
which function similarly as e1 and e2 enzymes in the
ubiquitin pathway and are homologs of these enzymes,
respectively, to conjugate atg8p to a phosphatidylethanol-
amine molecule [57] (fig. 4). the lipidated atg8p (called
microtubule-associated protein light chain-3ii in mammals)
can serve as a marker for macroautophagy [58], whereas the
non-lipidated form (microtubule-associated protein light
chain-3i) is constitutively expressed [58].
macroautophagy is activated transiently during the ﬁrst
24 h of starvation in vivo [59]. macroautophagy in the liver
is inhibited by insulin and amino acids and stimulated by
glucagon [40]. not all amino acids inhibit macroautophagy
equally. for example, in the liver, leucine can inhibit mac-
roautophagy more effectively than any other single amino
acid, but to achieve maximal inhibition, leucine must be
present with phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamine, proline,
histidine, tryptophan, methionine, and alanine [40]. amino

a complex in yeast and in mammals. in yeast, the complex
consists of vps34p-vps15p and atg14p-atg6p [71,72]. in
mammalian cells, the class iii pi3k is in a complex with its
adaptor protein p150 and the tumor-suppressor beclin1
(atg6p) [79,80]. the discovery that beclin1 is involved in
macroautophagy has provided a link between tumor pro-
gression and decreased macroautophagy [81].
the proper regulation of macroautophagy is essential to
maintain cellular homeostasis. when yeast are starved and
macroautophagy is blocked, cells rapidly lose intracellular
amino acids [82], protein synthesis fails, and cells die [83].
chaperone-mediated autophagy
during prolonged starvation, cma is responsible for
degrading approximately 30% of cytosolic proteins in cell
types such as hepatocytes, renal cells, and ﬁbroblasts [40].
substrates for cma contain a pentapeptide motif related to
kferq and are bound by a chaperone/cochaperone com-
plex containing the heat shock cognate protein of 70 kda
(hsc70) [84]. the substrate/chaperone/cochaperone com-
plex then docks to the receptor, lysosome-associated mem-
brane protein-2a (lamp-2a). once bound to the lysoso-
mal membrane, the substrate is unfolded and internalized
into the lumen of the lysosome, presumably through a trans-
locon formed by oligomerized lamp-2a, with the help of
a luminal isoform of hsc70 (ly-hsc70), and degraded (fig. 5)
[84].
in vitro cma degradation assay
highly puriﬁed lysosomes are able to selectively degrade
substrates of cma such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase or ribonuclease a (rnase a) [85] but not
non-substrates of cma such as ovalbumin [85]. these
isolated lysosomes could degrade proteins without adding
any exogenous factors; however, the addition of atp, an
atp-regenerating system, and hsc70 increased proteolysis
[85,86]. the degradation of substrate proteins was satura-
ble, and substrates could compete with one another for
import [85– 87]. binding of substrate proteins was permitted
at 4°c, but translocation was inhibited [85].
kferq motif in substrate proteins
kferq was ﬁrst described as the necessary sequence for
the more rapid degradation of microinjected [3h]rnase a
in response to serum withdrawal [88]. [3h]rnase a can be
cleaved with subtilisin into two fragments: residues 1–20

(rnase-s peptide) and residues 21–124 (rnase-s protein)
[88]. rnase-s protein was degraded at the same rate in the
presence or absence of serum, whereas rnase-s peptide
was degraded more rapidly in response to serum withdrawal
[88]. these data suggested that the ﬁrst 20 amino acids
contained a targeting sequence necessary for enhanced deg-
radation in response to serum withdrawal and the critical
sequence was eventually narrowed to amino acids 7–11,
kferq [89].
since the discovery of the targeting sequence, many
cma substrates have been identiﬁed by different research-
ers (table 3). by analyzing sequences of the cma sub-
strates, it became clear that the exact kferq sequence is
not necessary for degradation by cma [90]. the sequence
motif necessary for degradation by cma was determined to
be a glutamine (q) at one end and in any order a hydro-
phobic (f), an acidic (e), a basic (r), and a second hydro-
phobic or basic amino acid (k) [79]. accordingly, the tar-
geting sequence can be best described as (⫹,⫺,□,⫹/□), q
or q, (⫹,⫺,□,⫹/□), where the material within the paren-
thesis can be in any order, and conservative replacements
are allowed (⫹ ⫽ k, r; ⫺ ⫽ d, e; and □ ⫽ f, i, l, v)
[40,84].
approximately 30% of cytosolic proteins can be immu-
noprecipitated with an antibody against kferq [90]. pro-
teins such as aldolase-b have multiple kferq-like motifs,
but only one is necessary for enhanced proteolysis due to
serum withdrawal [91]. further studies demonstrated that
hsc70 could recognize the kferq-like region of rnase a,
suggesting that hsc70 might be involved in cma [92].
70-kda heat shock cognate protein
hsc70 in the cytosol and on the lysosomal membrane
(lym-hsc70) is in a complex with several other chaperones
and cochaperones [93]. the cytosolic form stimulates
cma, probably by unfolding protein substrates [94]. an
isoform of hsc70 without other chaperones and cochaper-
ones also exists in the lysosomal lumen (ly-hsc70) [95].
ly-hsc70 is internalized into the lysosomal lumen by mac-
roautophagy [86] and by cma [96]. hsc70 has two
kferq-like motifs (table 3).
ly-hsc70 appears to facilitate the transport of substrates
into the lysosome for degradation, although direct evidence
remains inconclusive. populations of lysosomes that contain
more ly-hsc70 are more active in cma compared with
populations of lysosomes with lower levels of ly-hsc70
[86].
a role for ly-hsc70 in cma was demonstrated by using
endocytosed anti-hsc70 antibodies. cma was abolished in
ﬁbroblasts pretreated with anti-hsc70 antibodies [96]. heat
shock proteins of 70 kda are required to pull substrates into
the lumen of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum
[97], so ly-hsc70 may play a similar role in lysosomes.
lamp-2a recycles between the lumen and the mem-
brane of the lysosome [98]. selective degradation of pro-
teins by cma depends in part on levels of lamp-2a in the
membrane [99]. during active proteolysis by cma,
lamp-2a is internalized and recycled back to the lysoso-
mal membrane [98]. anti-hsc70 antibodies decrease the
reinsertion of lamp-2a into the lysosomal membrane [98].
therefore, the inhibitory effect of anti-hsc70 antibodies on
cma may be an indirect effect caused by decreased levels
of lamp-2a at the lysosomal membrane.
lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a
lamp-2a is a 96-kda protein located in the lysosomal
membrane. the bulk of the protein resides in the lysosomal
lumen and is heavily glycosylated, presumably to protect it
from the harsh environment of the lysosome. lamp-2a has
a single transmembrane domain and a 12–amino acid cyto-
solic tail (fig. 6).
lamp-2a was identiﬁed as the receptor for cma [99]
based on the fact that substrate proteins could speciﬁcally

837
[94]. competing out methotrexate binding to dhfr by
adding its natural substrate, dihydrofolate, permitted it to be
internalized into lysosomes more efﬁciently [94]. these
data indicate that substrates must be unfolded before being
translocated into the lysosome.
activation of cma
activation of cma during times of prolonged nutrient
deprivation presumably provides a mechanism for increased
organismal survival under such conditions. cma may be a
mechanism by which individual cells can sacriﬁce proteins
that are less needed during starvation and use the amino
acids for necessary cell processes. for example, during
starvation glycolytic rates decrease [34], so glycolytic en-
zymes such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
and aldolase-b might be safely decreased in concentration
due to proteolysis by cma.
much is known about the mechanisms of cma, and the
way in which this proteolytic pathway is activated is be-
coming clear. levels of lamp-2a [85,100] and ly-hsc70
increase in response to starvation [2]. recent work has
identiﬁed ketone bodies, a physiologic indicator of starva-
tion that is derived by lipolysis, as activators of cma that
oxidize proteins within the cell and mark them for degra-
dation [101] . during rapid lipolysis, amino acids or carbo-
hydrates are also required to restore intermediates of the
citric acid cycle that become rate limiting for the reaction
cycle [3]. ketone bodies stimulating cma appears to be a
mechanistic link between lipolysis and this pathway of
proteolysis.
we speculate that other links between proteolysis and
lipolysis will be discovered. for example, carnitine is es-
sential for fatty acid oxidation (see below), and carnitine is
synthesized from trimethyllysines derived from protein deg-
radation [102]. it may be that certain cma substrates are
enriched for trimethyllysines, but this conjecture remains to
be proved.
interactions between macroautophagy and cma
macroautophagy is active only early in starvation [69],
whereas cma is active only in prolonged starvation [2]. it
seems possible that macroautophagy can selectively de-
grade intracellular inhibitors of cma. although macroau-
tophagy is considered to be non-selective in terms of protein
substrates, there is some selectivity in this process [103]. in
this case, macrautophagy would have to be activated before
cma could operate. mutations that block macroautophagy
might also block cma. another possibility is that macro-
autophagy is limited in time because some of the atg
proteins are substrates of cma. in this case, cma would be
required to turn off macroautophagy. this possibility could
be tested by speciﬁcally inhibiting cma [104] and testing
whether macroautophagy is increased in response to this
treatment.

shown for the cytosolic tail is the human lamp-2a. lampa-2a, lyso-
some-associated membrane protein-2a.
bind to the cytosolic tail of lamp-2a [99]. although sub-
strates alone can interact with lamp-2a [99], that interac-
tion is enhanced by the presence of the chaperone complex
(a. m. cuervo and j. f. dice, unpublished results). over-
expression of lamp-2a in cells in culture revealed that the
binding of substrate to lamp-2a is a rate-limiting step of
cma [99]. further, there is a direct correlation with the
amount of lamp-2a in the lysosomal membrane and cma
activity in vitro and in vivo [100].
at the lysosomal membrane, lamp-2a forms a multi-
mer, which may function as the translocon for substrates of
cma [100]. the cytosolic tail of lamp-2a contains four
amino acids that are required for substrate binding (krhh)
and are unique to lamp-2a compared with other lamp
isoforms [100]. interestingly lamp-2a levels decrease
with age as does the activity of cma [96]. a decrease in the
ability for cells to process damaged proteins may lead to a
variety of pathologies such as cancer and alzheimer’s, par-
kinson’s, and huntington’s diseases.
substrates of cma must be unfolded
proteins that are transported into mitochondria and the
endoplasmic reticulum must be unfolded to traverse the
membrane, but proteins can be translocated into peroxi-
somes in a fully folded state [97]. to address this question
for lysosomal import of cma substrates, derivatives of
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) were used. dhfr can be
placed into a tightly bound, protease-resistant conformation
by incubating it with its competitive inhibitor, methotrexate.
the binding of dhfr to lysosomes was not affected by the
presence of methotrexate, but its import was greatly reduced

lipolytic responses to starvation
fat breakdown is important in starvation to provide the
caloric needs for metabolism. in addition, sustained lipoly-
sis results in ketone body formation, which stimulates cma
in tissues that do not metabolize ffas, thus ensuring a
continued low level of proteolysis during a primarily lipo-
lytic phase of starvation.
breakdown of tag
lipids, stored in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal mus-
cle, are used to survive long-term starvation [105]. lipids
are stored in adipose tissue in the form of tag. during
starvation, tag is broken down into ffas, which are
released into the circulation and supply other tissues such as
skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and kidney with energy [106].
glycerol is also released from the breakdown of tag and is
converted to glucose by the liver [107]. catabolism of tag
within adipose tissue is regulated by a number of neural and
hormonal signals [107–109].
once adipose tissue receives the appropriate signals,
tag begins to be broken down. initially, hormone-sensitive
lipase (hsl) was thought to be the only lipase responsible
for catabolism of tag, but recent work has identiﬁed a
second lipase that is also involved in the catabolism of tag
in mice. adipose triacylglycerol lipase (atl) functions in
the initial hydrolysis of tag into diacylglycerol and ffa
(fig. 7) [110]. atl activity increases during starvation and
in response to epinephrine and glucocorticoids. although
hsl can hydrolyze tag, atl is much more efﬁcient and
appears to be the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the
hydrolysis of tag into diacylglycerol, at least in mice.
the second step in the catabolism of lipids is the break-
down of diacylglycerol into monoacylglycerol (fig. 7) me-
diated by hsl. the main regulators of hsl are insulin,
which inhibits hsl, and epinephrine, which stimulates
hsl. the lowered insulin and elevated epinephrine during
fasting activates hsl. monoacylglycerol is then catabolized
into ffa and glycerol by the enzyme monoacylglycerol
lipase [111]. therefore, catabolism of each tag molecule
liberates three ffa molecules and one molecule of glycerol
(fig. 7). after approximately 24 h of starvation, ffa and
glycerol concentrations begin to increase in the blood, in-
dicating that lipolysis is induced [112].
ffas produced by tag catabolism are released into the
blood plasma, where they travel to the liver, skeletal muscle,
heart, and kidney to be used as substrates for energy pro-
duction. ffas are poorly soluble in the aqueous environ-
ment of the blood so they are delivered to tissues mostly
bound to albumin [113]. once ffas arrive at speciﬁc tis-
sues, they are transported across the membrane by fatty acid
transport proteins [114]. ffas may also enter cells by a
passive ﬂip-ﬂop through the lipid bilayer [114]. once in the
cytosol, ffas may be shuttled around by a variety of lipid-
carrier proteins, such as fatty acid binding protein-c or
caveolin-1, which deliver them to a multitude of destina-
tions such as the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria
[115]. conversely, speciﬁc ffa binding proteins in cells
may not be necessary because ffas will bind to many
hydrophobic pockets within proteins [115].
perilipin a
the major protein that associates with lipid droplets in
fat cells, perilipin a, plays critical roles in lipogenesis and
lipolysis [116,117]. phosphorylation of perilipin a by pro-
tein kinase-a [117] allows phosphorylated hsl to bind to
the lipid droplet and begin lipolysis [118]. perilipin may
also act as a barrier for access of atl to the lipid droplet
[119]. perilipin knockout mice have dramatically decreased
fat stores when compared with normal mice, and isolated
adipocytes show increased lipolysis when compared with
adipocytes from control animals [120].
movement of acyl-coa into the mitochondria
during starvation ffas accumulate in hepatocytes, car-
diac myocytes, renal tubular cells, and skeletal muscle tis-
sue, where they are oxidized (␤-oxidation) in the mitochon-
dria into acetyl-coa for use in the krebs cycle or for
production of ketone bodies. accumulation of ffa in hepa-
tocytes results in the conversion to acyl-coa by the cyto-
solic enzyme acyl-coa synthetase. acyl-coa cannot be
directly transferred into the mitochondria, so this step be-
comes an important point of regulation for the ␤-oxidation
of fatty acids [121]. for acyl-coa to be translocated into the
mitochondria, the acyl group must be transferred from the
coa to carnitine,
translocated across the mitochondrial
membrane, and then transferred back from carnitine to coa
(fig. 8). this step is performed by the enzymes carnitine
palmitoyl transferase-i on the outer membrane and carnitine
acylcarnitine translocase and carnitine palmitoyl
trans-
ferase-ii on the inner mitochondrial membrane. to maintain
appropriate levels of carnitine within the cytoplasm, carni-
tine acylcarnitine translocase exchanges acylcarnitine with
carnitine [122]. the ﬁnal stages of ␤-oxidation in the mi-
tochondria take place by a variety of enzymatic reactions
that ultimately lead to the production of acetyl-coa.

ies in the form of three molecules: acetoacetate, ␤-hydroxy-
butyrate (boh), and acetone (fig. 9) [124]. of these three
molecules, only acetoacetate and boh are metabolically
active, but acetone provides a convenient volatile odor for
detection of ketosis.
production of ketone bodies serves an important function
for survival during starvation. ketone bodies, boh specif-
ically, play a role in the regulation of lipolysis [125] by
interacting with the nicotinic acid receptor protein up reg-
ulated in macrophages by interferon gamma (puma-g),
which decreases the rate of lipolysis, thereby prolonging
lipid stores within the body and promoting long-term sur-
vival [125].
although the liver possesses the enzymes necessary for
ketone body production, it does not produce the necessary
enzymes to metabolize these compounds. as a result, ke-
tone bodies accumulate in the blood and function to provide
a source of energy to tissues such as brain, heart, muscle,
and kidney during conditions of glucose scarcity [124].
ketone bodies suppress muscle proteolysis by unknown
mechanisms [126]. during starvation, concentrations of ke-
tone bodies increase to concentrations of up to 12 mm
[127].
although muscle tissue can metabolize ketone bodies
and ffas, the brain can metabolize only ketone bodies.
astrocytes can synthesize ketone bodies during starvation,
which would provide additional nutrition to the brain in
times of nutrient deprivation [128].
although this review has focused only on the proteolytic
and lipolytic effects of starvation, there are a number of
other responses that occur within the starving animal to
maintain life. for example, as listed in table 1, the most
active form of thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine, decreases
during starvation. the decrease of this hormone and the
production of the inactive reverse triiodothyronine decrease
the metabolic rate [129], which decrease the amount of

ffa entry into the mitochondria is a regulated process.
in the fed state, insulin maintains high levels of malonyl-
coa. high levels of malonyl-coa inhibit ffa entry into
the mitochondria by directly inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl
transferase-i [102]. as blood glucose decreases, so do cel-
lular glycolysis levels. this results in a decrease of the
activity of acetyl-coa carboxylase, the enzyme responsible
for the production of malonyl-coa. once malonyl-coa
production decreases, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-i be-
comes activated and ffas can gain entry into the mitochon-
dria. during the fed state, high levels of malonyl-coa not
only inhibits ␤-oxidation of fatty acids but also stimulates
lipogenesis [102].
ffas and glycerol inhibit lipolysis [121]. such negative
feedback inhibition is common in cell physiology, but the
mechanisms for this inhibition are unknown.
production of ketone bodies
during starvation, a great demand is placed on the liver
to provide energy for the rest of the organism. as insulin
levels decrease and glucagon levels increase, the liver be-
gins to deplete glycogen stores to provide glucose for ex-
trahepatic tissues. as starvation persists to 24 h, an in-
creased demand is placed on the liver to produce enough
energy for survival. for example, the liver needs to maintain
the krebs cycle for intrahepatic atp production and glu-
coneogenesis for supplying glucose to extrahepatic tissues.
because these two processes require the same intermediates,
with oxaloacetate being rate limiting [123], the krebs cycle
and gluconeogenesis begin to slow down. as a result,
acetyl-coa accumulates in the mitochondria, which leads to
a series of condensation reactions that produce ketone bod-
840

energy required for survival. this response in turn spares
lipid and protein to extend life.
concluding remarks
proteolysis is activated during short-term starvation to
supply the body with amino acids for energy and continued
protein synthesis. although we have predominately dis-
cussed the proteolysis that occurs in liver and in muscle,
virtually all tissues, except brain and testes/ovaries, undergo
some form of increased proteolysis to survive during star-
vation. most amino acids can be metabolized into krebs
cycle intermediates, which in turn produce atp. activation
of proteolytic cascades during starvation serves to provide
energy and to spare lipid stores in case the period of star-
vation is only a few hours. as starvation persists, protein
catabolism decreases to spare this important cellular com-
ponent as energy is derived from lipolysis. this protein-
sparing effect is regulated by a variety of complex hor-
monal, neuronal, and cellular regulatory events.
physiologic responses to starvation are as complex as
they are interesting. one way that proteolytic pathways and
lipolytic pathways interact is through ketone bodies. ketone
bodies inhibit protein degradation in skeletal muscle, a
reasonable response because in this tissue ketone bodies can
be used for energy.
because ketone bodies circulate in the blood at high
concentrations and most cells and tissues are able to inter-
nalize them regardless of whether or not they can metabo-
lize them [130]. therefore, it appears that multiple cell
types are exposed to high levels of ketone bodies and are
unable to metabolize them. interestingly, the appearance of
ketone bodies during starvation coincides with activation of
cma. ketone bodies stimulate cma in cell types that
cannot metabolize boh for energy. future work will shed
light on the complexities and intricacies of the vast physi-
ologic responses to starvation.
