abstract
polyalanine expansions in the phox2b gene have been detected in the vast majority of patients affected with congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome, a neurocristopathy characterized by absence of adequate control of breathing, especially during sleep,
with decreased sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia. the correlation between length of the alanine expanded tracts and severity of
congenital central hypoventilation syndrome respiratory phenotype has been conﬁrmed by length-dependent cytoplasmic phox2b
retention with formation of aggregates.
to deepen into the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of phox2b polyalanine expansions, we have set up experiments
aimed at assessing the fate of cells characterized by phox2b polyalanine aggregates. in particular, we have observed that activation
of the heat shock response by the drug geldanamycin is efﬁcient both in preventing formation and in inducing clearance of phox2b
pre-formed polyalanine aggregates in cos-7 cells expressing phox2b-gfp fused proteins, and ultimately also in rescuing the
phox2b ability to transactivate the dopamine-β-hydroxilase promoter. in addition, we have demonstrated elimination of phox2b
mutant proteins by the proteasome and autophagy, two cellular mechanisms already been involved in the clearance of proteins
containing expanded polyglutamine and polyalanine tracts. moreover, our data suggest that geldanamycin effects on phox2b
aggregates may be also mediated by the proteasome pathway. finally, analysis of cellular toxicity due to polyalanine aggregates
has conﬁrmed the occurrence of cell apoptosis consequent to expression of phox2b carrying the longest expanded alanine tract
and shown that geldanamycin can delay cell progression toward the most advanced apoptotic stages.

1. introduction
heterozygous polyalanine expansions and frameshift
mutations of the phox2b gene have been detected
in 90% of patients affected with congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome (cchs) (amiel et al., 2003;
matera et al., 2004; sasaki et al., 2003; weese-mayer
et al., 2003), a rare neurocristopathy characterized
by absence of adequate autonomic control of breath-
ing, mainly during sleep, with decreased sensitivity to
hypoxia and hypercapnia (coleman et al., 1980; weese-
mayer et al., 1999). this is consistent with the role of
the phox2b transcription factor that regulates several
genes involved in the speciﬁcation of the noradrenergic
phenotype during the development of the autonomic ner-
vous system (adachi et al., 2000; bachetti, borghini, et
al., 2005; borghini et al., 2006; brunet & pattyn, 2002;
flora et al., 2001). in particular, in-frame duplications
within a 20 alanine residues stretch in the phox2b exon
3, leading to expansions from +5 to +13 alanine residues,
have been identiﬁed in the vast majority (from 81.5% to
98.4% depending on the series) of the cchs patients car-
rying phox2b mutations (matera et al., 2004; sasaki et
al., 2003; trochet, o’brien, et al., 2005; weese-mayer
et al., 2003).
the previously postulated correlation between length
of alanine expanded tracts and severity of cchs respira-
tory phenotype (matera et al., 2004; weese-mayer et al.,
2003) has recently been conﬁrmed by functional studies
aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms underly-
ing cchs pathogenesis (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005;
trochet, hong, et al., 2005). in particular, a strictly pro-
gressive decrease in the transcriptional activation of the
dβh and phox2a promoters has been correlated with
length-dependent cytoplasmic retention and formation
of aggregates.
polyalanine regions are present in several transcrip-
tion factors and in-frame duplications in these sequences
are emerging causes of human genetic diseases (brown
& brown, 2004; lavoie et al., 2003). polyalanine expan-
sions induce misfolding in a way similar to what hap-
pens in polyglutamine expansion-containing proteins
(behrouz et al., 1995), which are responsible for sev-
eral neurodegenerative diseases including huntington’s
disease and spinocerebellar ataxia (trottier et al., 1995).
moreover, it has been observed that aggregate-prone pro-
teins with polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions are
degraded by autophagy (ravikumar et al., 2002) and
by the proteasome machinery (abu-baker et al., 2003;
davies, sarkar, et al., 2006).
several immunocytochemical studies have revealed
co-localisation of components of the heat shock response
pathway and members of the proteasome machinery with
aggregates of misfolded proteins characterized by the
expansion of polyalanine and polyglutamine residues,
like in the case of pabpn1, arx, phox2b and hunt-
ingtin (abu-baker et al., 2003; nasrallah et al., 2004;
sittler et al., 2001; trochet, hong, et al., 2005). in
mammalian cells, the heat shock response may be acti-
vated by the benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin
(ga) that inhibits hsp90 function and consequently
induces expression of the molecular chaperones hsp40
and hsp70, already shown to suppress protein aggrega-
tion due to polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions
(albrecht et al., 2004; jana et al., 2000; sittler et al.,
2001). in particular, overexpression of hsp70 and its
recruitment in the nucleus have been observed to reduce
aggregation of pabpn1 polyalanine expanded mutants
(wang et al., 2005).
in the present work, we report a functional study
aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying clear-
ance of phox2b polyalanine aggregates and fate of the
cells where they accumulate. in particular, we have inves-
tigated the role of geldanamycin both in the formation of
phox2b polyalanine aggregates and in the clearance of
cos-7 cells, expressing phox2b-gfp fused proteins,
from pre-formed inclusions. moreover, as aggregates of
homopolymeric tracts implicated in protein misfolding
and human disease have shown to be associated with
a wide cell toxicity (nasrallah et al., 2004), a possible
impairment in cell viability caused by phox2b aggre-
gates has also been investigated.
2. material and methods
2.1. cell cultures, transient transfection and
“luciferase” reporter activity assay
hela cells were grown in minimal essential medium
(mem, euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs) (gibco, new zealand), 1% l-glutamine
100×, 1% non-essential aminoacids, 100 u/ml penicillin
and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
with 5% co2.
cos-7 cells were grown in dulbecco’s modiﬁed
essential medium (dmem, sigma) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (gibco, new zealand),
1% l-glutamine 100×, 1% non-essential aminoacids,
100 u/ml penicillin and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% co2.
one day before transfection, 8.5× 104 hela cells
were plated in 35 mm diameter dishes; co-transfection
was performed using fugene6 transfection reagent
(roche) with 740 ng of expression plasmids and 140 ng

of the dβh promoter-reporter plasmid. in particular,
the pcdna3.1topo-phox2b wild type expression
construct and pcdna3.1topo-dup15, -dup27 and -
dup39 mutant phox2b expression constructs (carry-
ing 5, 9 and 13 extra alanine residues, respectively, in
the 20 alanine stretch) (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005)
were co-transfected with 807 bp of the dβh regula-
tory region cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter
gene. the plasmid prl-cmv, expressing the renilla
luciferase gene, was used as an internal control of
each sample. forty-eight hours after transfection, cells
were assayed for luciferase’s activity (dual-luciferase
reporter assay system, promega) using a td-20/20
luminometer following manufacturer’s instructions.
2.2. immunoﬂuorescence assays
2.2.1. analysis of phox2b-gfp wild type and
mutant proteins
fluorescence analysis was performed on cos-7
cells transfected with 400 ng of the gfp reporter
plasmids pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo[phox2b wt],
pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo[dup15],
pcdna3.1/ct-
gfp-topo[dup27]
and pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo
[dup39]. these constructs, simply referred to as also
“wt”, “dup15”, “dup27” and “dup39”, express gfp-
fused wt, +5ala, +9ala and +13ala mutant phox2b
proteins, respectively (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005).
forty-eight hours after transfection, at least 100 cells for
each experiment were examined with a zeiss axiophot
ﬂuorescence microscope. nuclei were stained with
dapi (roche).
2.2.2. analysis of vimentin localisation
after
expression
forty-eight hours
transfection with the
con-
pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo[dup39]
struct, cos-7 cells were washed with pbs, ﬁxed for
15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized
(cid:3)
for 15
with 0.1% triton-x-100/pbs and blocked
(cid:3)
for 5
with 10% fbs/1% bsa/0.1% tween20/pbs.
plates were then incubated with a tritc-conjugated
vimentin-speciﬁc antibody (santa cruz biotechnology)
for 90 min and, after washing with pbs, were analysed
with a zeiss axiophot ﬂuorescence microscope. nuclei
were stained with dapi (roche); each experiment was
repeated at least three times and, for each experiment,
100–150 cells were assessed.
2.3. pharmacological treatments of transfected
cells
geldanamycin (sigma) 1.8 mm stock in dmso was
diluted into fresh medium to give ﬁnal concentrations
of 10 nm, 150 nm and 360 nm and added to cells at
the time of transfection or 48 h later. 3-methyladenine
(3-ma, sigma) 1 m stock in dmem, lactacystin (cal-
biochem) 1 mm stock in sterile water were added to
cells at the time of transfection to give a ﬁnal concentra-
tion of 5–15 mm and 5–15 ␮m, respectively. rapamycin
(sigma) 0.4 mg/ml stock in dmso was added to cells
at the time of transfection at a ﬁnal concentration of
0.2 ␮g/ml.
2.4. western blotting assays
hela cells were cultured in 100 mm dishes and trans-
fected with 6 ␮g of each expression construct (fugene6
transfection reagent, roche). to obtain total cellular
lysates, 48 h after transfection cells were washed with
pbs, centrifugated and lysed with lysis buffer (tris–hcl
50 mm ph 7.5, nacl 150 mm, na3vo4 1 mm, np40
1%, edta 2 mm, protease inhibitor mix 1×). equal
amounts of total lysates were electrophoresed on 10%
sds-page and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂu-
oride membrane (millipore). proteins were identiﬁed
by probing the membrane with the goat polyclonal
anti-rabbit phox2b antibody (santa cruz), speciﬁcally
addressed against the protein n-terminal region, with
the goat monoclonal hsp70 speciﬁc antibody (santa
cruz) and then with the mouse anti-goat igg-hrpp
(santa cruz). signals were detected using the chemi-
luminescence reagent ecl plus (amersham) and pro-
teins level in each sample was evaluated by comparison
with the corresponding amount of the housekeeping ␤-
actin.
2.5. facs analysis of apoptosis
either
transient
transfections were performed plating
directly in 60 mm diameter dishes 8× 104 cos-
7 cells and the transfection mix containing 1 ␮g
of
pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo[phox2bwt],
pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo[dup15],
pcdna3.1/ct-
gfp-topo[dup27]
pcdna3.1/ct-gfp-topo
[dup39] expression construct with 3 ␮l of fugene6
transfection reagent (roche).
or
apoptosis of cos-7 cells expressing gfp-fused pro-
teins was detected both in the supernatant and in adherent
fractions of cells using the human annexin v-pe apop-
tosis detection kit (pharmingen, bd biosciences, san
jose, ca) and analysis was performed by ﬂow cytometry
setting the gate on gfp + cells (facscalibur, bd bio-
sciences, cell quest software). results were expressed
as percent of positive cells.

3. results
3.1. dose-dependent effect of geldanamycin on
phox2b polyalanine aggregates and nuclear
localisation
geldanamycin (ga) is a naturally occurring antibi-
otic that interacts with hsp90 and leads to up-regulation
of hsp40 and hsp70 (sittler et al., 2001), two heat shock
proteins involved in recognition and refolding denatured
molecules, in addition to disassembling intracellular pro-
tein aggregates (hartl & hayer-hartl, 2002).
we have already demonstrated that polyalanine
expansions induce phox2b mis-localisation with pres-
ence of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic phox2b aggre-
gates and without any effect on the protein expression
level (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005). more recently, it
has also been shown co-localisation of phox2b and
hsp70, in addition to a preliminary observation of
ga-dependent nuclear localisation of phox2b carry-
ing the largest polyalanine tract (trochet, hong, et al.,
2005). therefore, we aimed to deep into the chaperone-
inducing effect of geldanamycin on synthesis of mis-
folded polyalanine phox2b leading to intracellular
aggregates.
to this end, we have analysed the ga dose-
dependent effect on subcellular localisation and aggre-
gates formation of mutated phox2b carrying the largest
polyalanine expansion (dup39, corresponding to +13ala
residues). cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with
pcdna3.1/ct-topo-gfp[dup39] and, at the time of
transfection (t = 0), increasing amounts of ga were
added to transfected cells.
fluorescence microscope analysis performed 48 h
later showed that cells transfected with the dup39 con-
struct, thus expressing phox2b(+13ala), and treated
with ga at the time of transfection displayed a dose-
dependent progressive increase in nuclear localisation
of the protein, with respect to untreated or dmso only
treated transfected cells, resembling cells expressing
phox2b(wt) at the highest dose of ga (fig. 1, upper).
consistently, a parallel ga dose-dependent decrease in
aggregates formation was also observed (fig. 1, lower).
as the concentration of 360 nm ga gave the most
efﬁcient rescue of correct nuclear localisation, we car-
ried on further assays under this condition. the pat-
tern of phox2b protein distribution observed in cells
transfected with dup15- and dup27-gfp expression con-
structs, in the absence (no ga) or in the presence (ga)
of a ga treatment starting at the time of transfection
(t = 0) conﬁrmed what already observed with the largest
expansion. in particular, in agreement with what we and
fig. 1. dose-effect of geldanamycin on sub-cellular localisation of
polyalanine expanded phox2b and formation of phox2b polyala-
nine aggregates. in the upper panel, the dose-dependent effect of
geldanamycin on the sub-cellular localisation of the phox2b(+13ala)
protein is represented as percentage of cos-7 cells transfected with
pcdna3.1/ct-topo-gfp[dup39], and characterized by exclusively
nuclear (black), nuclear + cytoplasmic (grey) and exclusively cyto-
plasmic (white) localisation. the effects of either no treatment or
dmso only treatment on the subcellular localisation of ﬂuorescence
in cos-7 cells expressing phox2b(+13ala) are reported as negative
controls in the diagram, while the far right bar reﬂects the cellular
localisation of the phox2b wild type protein. in the lower panel, the
dose-dependent effect of geldanamycin on the percentage of cos-7
cells with nuclear and/or cytoplasmic aggregates following transfec-
tion with pcdna3.1/ct-topo-gfp[dup39] is represented. positive
and negative controls are the same as above.
others have already reported (bachetti, matera, et al.,
2005; trochet, hong, et al., 2005), in the absence of ga
a correlation between increasing length of the alanine
repeats and percentage of cells characterized by com-
plete or partial cytoplasmic localisation of aggregates
was conﬁrmed, while addition of ga allowed a correct
nuclear distribution for the three mutant transcription
factors, likely consequent to correct folding of the cor-
responding proteins (not shown).
to assess a possible and still unexplored ga effect not
only in preventing polyalanine phox2b aggregation but
also in cleaning cells from already formed aggregates,
ga was added to cos-7 cells 48 h after transfection
with wild type- (no extra ala), dup15- (+5ala), dup27-
(+9ala) and dup39- (+13ala) phox2b-gfp expression
constructs. analysis of the phox2b cellular localisa-
tion and of the amount of aggregates were performed
2 and 3 days later. as shown in fig. 2a, a 3-day treat-
ment was sufﬁcient for phox2b misfolded proteins to
correctly localize in the nucleus. such a rescue of the
nuclear localisation was complete for dup15 and dup27

promoter by polyalanine expanded phox2b. transcriptional activity
obtained by co-transfection of phox2b constructs carrying polyala-
nine expanded tracts with a luciferase reporter gene construct con-
taining the dβh regulator region. the dark bars represent transac-
tivation of the promoter in the absence of geldanamycin while the
grey bars represent transactivation of the promoter in the presence of
geldanamycin during co-transfection. values are represented as per-
centage of luciferase activity induced by the wild-type construct and
are the mean± s.d. of three independent experiments performed in
duplicate. signiﬁcant differences between presence and absence of
ga treatment with dup27 and dup39 phox2b mutants are indicated
by asterisks (student’s t-test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
transfections were carried out in the absence (no
ga) or in the presence of 360 nm geldanamycin (ga
360 nm), and luciferase activity levels induced 48 h later
in cells expressing mutant phox2b proteins were com-
pared with the values obtained by testing the wild type
phox2b construct under the same condition (fig. 3).
according to previous data, impaired transcriptional
activation of the dβh promoter was assessed in the
absence of geldanamycin (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005;
trochet, hong, et al., 2005). conversely, when gel-
danamycin was added in the culture medium during
transfection, all the phox2b polyalanine expanded pro-
teins could recover, though at different extents, the ability
to transactivate the dβh promoter. in particular, con-
structs carrying +5 (dup15) and +9 (dup27) alanine
residues showed a complete recovery in the transacti-
vation of the dβh regulatory region, while phox2b
carrying the largest expanded alanine tract (dup39) could
re-gain only part of the transcriptional activity.
3.3. role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and of
autophagy in the clearance of phox2b polyalanine
aggregates
the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and autophagy
are two mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of
protein balance in eukaryotic cells (layﬁeld et al., 2003;
shintani & klionsky, 2004).

days. (b) the percentage of cells with dup39 phox2b aggregates is

cated by asterisks (student’s t-test, *p < 0.05).
phox2b proteins, while it was only partial for the dup39
phox2b, the mutant protein associated with the greatest
percentage of aggregates. nonetheless, in this latter case,
a drastic decrease in the number of cells with aggregates
was observed following shorter ga treatments (fig. 2b).
3.2. effect of geldanamycin on transactivation of
the dβh promoter mediated by expanded
polyalanine phox2b
previous results of ours (bachetti, matera, et al.,
2005) have shown a strict correlation between progres-
sive decrease in dβh promoter transcriptional activa-
tion and length of the phox2b alanine expanded tract
in hela cells, the cell culture system where the func-
tional interaction between phox2b and this target pro-
moter was ﬁrstly demonstrated (adachi et al., 2000).
to verify whether the transcriptional activation of the
dβh promoter could be rescued by treatments with gel-
danamycin, hela cells were co-transfected with wild
type-, dup15-, dup27- and dup39-phox2b expression
constructs and a luciferase reporter construct contain-
ing the dβh regulatory region.

(trochet, hong, et al., 2005), and the identiﬁcation of
components of the proteasome machinery in cellular
aggregates due to polyalanine expansions of pabpn1,
hoxd13 and ataxin 7 (abu-baker et al., 2003; albrecht
et al., 2004; latouche et al., 2005), prompted us to inves-
tigate whether the proteasome activity could remove
phox2b misfolded proteins. moreover, as autophagy
has been shown to play an important role in degrada-
tion of aggregate-prone proteins carrying polyglutamine
or polyalanine expansions (ravikumar et al., 2002), we
also aimed at analyzing its possible effect on the clear-
ance of phox2b cell inclusions.
cos-7 cells were transfected with the phox2b-gfp
expression construct carrying the largest polyalanine
expansion (dup39; +13ala) and added with increasing
amounts of either the speciﬁc proteasome catalytic-␤-
subunit inhibitor lactacystin or the autophagy speciﬁc
inhibitor 3-methyladenine, at the time of transfection
(t = 0). forty-eight hours later, phox2b(+13ala) local-
isation and percentage of cells characterized by aggre-
gates in the presence of either the two inhibitors were
compared with those observed in the absence of any
treatment.
as shown in upper panel of fig. 4a, although 5 ␮m
lactacystin was already able to decrease the amount of
cells characterized by an exclusive phox2b(+13ala)
nuclear localisation, the most remarkable effect was
obtained with the addition of 10 ␮m lactacystin. a
regression line is shown in the middle panel conﬁrming
a correlation between dose of lactacystin and percentage
of cells with a nuclear localisation of phox2b(+13ala).
moreover, inhibition of proteasome activity resulted
in the increase not only of cytoplasmic phox2b
localisation but also of the proportion of cells con-
taining aggregates (fig. 4a, bottom panel). more-
over, we observed, in 30–40% of cells expressing the
phox2b(+13ala) mutant protein, the formation of sin-
gle large cytosolic perinuclear aggregates often distort-
ing the contour of the nucleus, resembling aggresomes,
namely cell structures deﬁned as pericentriolar inclu-
sions containing misfolded proteins accompanied by a
reorganization of the cytoskeleton intermediate ﬁlament
vimentin (johnston et al., 1998).
to verify such an interpretation for the observed
aggregates, we investigated the localisation of vimentin
in cells transfected with the dup39 construct and treated
with lactacystin. in fig. 4b, the distribution pattern of
vimentin is shown in cells containing single large jux-
tanuclear aggregates (rows i and ii) and in a cell charac-
terized by several phox2b aggregates scattered in the
cytoplasm (row iii). as predicted, while in this latter case
a diffuse pattern of vimentin could be observed, single

large aggregates presented a phox2b-containing core
surrounded by a cage-like structure composed of con-
densed vimentin-positive ﬁbers, typical of the so-called
aggresomes.
the role of autophagy in the clearance of mutant
phox2b proteins has been investigated inducing inhi-
bition and activation of this cellular mechanism by
treatments with 3-methyladenine and rapamycin, respec-
tively.
in particular, similarly to the effect induced by lacta-
cystin, treatment of cells expressing the dup39 construct
with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine led to a
dose-dependent decrease in nuclear phox2b(+13ala)
localisation (fig. 5a, upper and middle panels) and
a marked increase in cells characterized by phox2b
aggregates exclusively localized in the cytoplasm
(fig. 5a, lower panel). differently from what observed
following lactacystin treatments, no aggresome could be
detected.
as expected, and opposite to the effect of autophagy
inhibition, addition of rapamycin to cells expressing the
dup39 construct led to a signiﬁcant increase in nuclear
localisation of the phox2b(+13ala) protein (fig. 5b)
and to a marked decrease in aggregates (not shown).
the simultaneous inhibition of proteasome by addition
of lactacystin in the same cell system caused a small
and not signiﬁcant decrease in nuclear localisation of
the mutant protein with respect to autophagy activation
alone (fig. 5b).
3.4. analysis of the role of proteasome in
geldanamycin effects
several studies have shown that hsp90 inhibitors
may act by inducing both the refolding mechanism
through the heat shock response and/or the proteasome-
mediated degradation of the protein (vanaja et al., 2002;
waza et al., 2005, 2006).
therefore, we wondered whether
the refolding
effect observed after ga treatment of cells expressing
phox2b mutant proteins was directly due to ga abil-
ity in increasing the activity of chaperones or it was the
indirect result of a promoted degradation of phox2b
aggregates.
to investigate the possibility that geldanamycin facil-
itates the degradation of mutant phox2b, we have anal-
ysed mutant phox2b(+13ala) expression levels both
before and after the ga treatment.
to this end, hela cells were transfected with the
dup39 expression construct and added with ga 360 nm.
forty-eight hours later, analysis of total cellular lysates
for phox2b expression showed a less amount of pro-

sation are reported. values represent the mean± s.d. of at least two

localisation of the mutant protein, proteasome inhibition
counteracted this effect by inducing an increase in the
proportion of cells with cytoplasmic phox2b (fig. 6b),
thus conﬁrming that the proteasome machinery plays a
relevant role in the geldanamycin induced cellular pro-
cesses.
3.5. cellular toxicity and phox2b polyalanine
expansions
to investigate whether aggregates due to polyala-
nine expansions could be associated with cell toxicity,
we have compared the extent of death detected in cells
expressing wild type phox2b protein and phox2b
carrying alanine expanded tracts.
first, we have evaluated nuclei morphology in cells
transfected with wt and dup39 constructs, encoding
native phox2b or the phox2b(+13ala) proteins,
respectively. gfp positive cells showing dapi-stained
nuclei characterized by irregular borders, fragmenta-
tion or pyknosis were considered as dying or already
dead (fig. 7a, upper panel). starting from 2 days,
and up to 4 and 7 days after transfection, a signiﬁcant
increase in non-standard nuclei (including both irregu-
lar + fragmented) was observed in cells expressing the
mutant protein with respect to cells expressing wild type
phox2b (fig. 7a, lower panel).
in order to understand whether phox2b polyala-
nine aggregates may be associated with programmed
cell death (pcd), we have assessed cell apoptosis by
staining cells with the apoptotic markers annexin v and
7-amino-actinomycin d (7-aad), followed by facs
analysis. annexin v binding represents a hallmark of
early apoptosis, implying that cells have lost their mem-
brane asymmetry but not their membrane integrity. as
7-aad staining is a sign of cell permeability and cell
disintegration and simultaneous positive reaction to both
7-aad and annexin v characterizes cells in advanced
stage of apoptosis, both cells in the early stage of apop-
tosis (annexin v+, 7-aad−) and cells in the late stage
of apoptosis (annexin v+, 7-aad+) were considered as
apoptotic.
seven days after transfection of cos-7 cells with
expression constructs for gfp-fused phox2b wt,
+5ala, +9ala and +13ala, a weak but signiﬁcant
increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells could be
demonstrated in correspondence of phox2b(+13ala)
expression, as expected given the larger amount of aggre-
gates also induced by the same construct. conversely, no
signiﬁcant difference was detected between wild type
and other phox2b mutants carrying shorter polyala-
nine expanded stretches (fig. 7b).

cos-7 cells transfected with the dup39 construct was performed

and lactacystin 10 ␮m (“dup39 + ga + lc”). differences statistically
signiﬁcant between “dup39” and “dup39 + ga + lc” and between

tein in cells added with ga with respect to untreated
cells, suggesting a possible role of this drug in facilitating
degradation of the mutant protein. a remarkable induc-
tion of the heat shock response by ga was assessed by
analysis of hsp70 levels in the same samples (fig. 6a).
moreover, as geldanamycin has been shown to
enhance the proteasome-mediated degradation of sev-
eral proteins (vanaja et al., 2002; bender et al., 2000),
we have analysed whether this mechanism was mediat-
ing geldanamycin effects also in our cellular system.
cos-7 were transfected with the dup39 expression
construct and added with ga, either in the absence or
in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin.
analysis of phox2b(+13ala) localisation consequent
to the different drug treatments showed that, while ga
was able to rescue almost completely the correct nuclear
t. bachetti et al. / the international journal of biochemistry & cell biology 39 (2007) 327–339
335
finally, we investigated whether the ga treatment,
besides the partial rescue of correct nuclear localisation
of phox2b(+13ala) and the decrease in protein mis-
folded aggregation, might have an effect on cell survival.
to this end, cos-7 cells were transfected with the dup39
construct and added with ga 48 h after transfection, to
allow aggregates formation. five days later, facs anal-
ysis of cells still carrying the ﬂuorescent plasmid showed
that ga treatment had not affected the total rate of apop-
totic cells; however, an increase of early apoptosis and
a simultaneous decrease in the percentage of cells pos-
itive for both apoptosis markers (annexin v+/7-aad+)
could be demonstrated, thus suggesting that ga acts by
diminishing the fraction of cells in advanced apoptotic
stages (fig. 7c).
4. discussion
in this work, we have focused on mechanisms adopted
by cells to remove the pathogenetic aggregates induced
by phox2b polyalanine expansions and on the cellular
response to their possible toxic effect.
first, we have demonstrated a dose-dependent effect
of the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin (ga) in pre-
venting phox2b polyalanine aggregation when added
to cells during transfection. the heat shock response,
would therefore protect non-native phox2b protein
chains from misfolding and aggregation, thus also allow-
ing the correct nuclear localisation of this transcription
factor. in a successive step of our study, we wondered
whether pre-formed phox2b polyalanine aggregates
cos-7 cells expressing phox2b wt, +5ala (dup15), +9ala (dup27)
and +13ala (dup39)-gfp fused proteins. cells were stained with
annexin v and 7-aad and analysed by ﬂow cytometry setting the
gate on gfp + cells. the total rate of apoptosis (early and late) was
determined by adding the percentage of annexin v+/7-aad− with
annexin v+/7-aad+ cells. results are expressed as ratio between
the proportion of apoptotic cells between the population expressing
the mutant protein with respect to cells expressing the wild type
phox2b (arbitrary value = 1) 7 days after transfection. values are the
mean± s.d. of at least three independent experiments. the signiﬁcant
difference between wt and dup39, assessed by student’s t-test, is indi-
cated by the asterisk (*p < 0.05). on the right part of the panel, the same
results are reported as percentage of total cells undergoing apoptosis
(mean± s.d. of three independent experiments). (c) cytoﬂuorimetric
analysis of early (annexin v+/7-aad) and late (annexin v+/7-aad+)
apoptosis in cells expressing phox2b(+13ala) in the presence or

between proportions of apoptotic cells in ga treated and in untreated
cells (arbitrary value = 1). results are the mean± s.d. of two inde-
pendent experiments. the signiﬁcant difference between ga-treated
and the corresponding untreated apoptotic cells, assessed by student’s
t-test, is indicated by asterisk (*p < 0.05).

could be eliminated by delayed ga treatments. in partic-
ular, we observed that an exclusively nuclear localisation
of the mutant protein could be achieved for phox2b
carrying ﬁve and nine extra alanine residues after 3
days of ga treatment, while nuclear localisation of
phox2b carrying the longest polyalanine tract expan-
sion (+13ala) could be only partially observed. in this
latter case, however, shorter treatments were sufﬁcient
to drastically decrease the amount of aggregates of the
mutant protein, suggesting that nuclear translocation fol-
lows the cell recovery from large amounts of phox2b
aggregates.
our recent results have shown a strict correlation
between reduction of dβh promoter transactivation and
increasing length of phox2b co-transfected polyala-
nine tracts (bachetti, matera, et al., 2005; trochet, hong,
et al., 2005). in agreement with the effect of ga treat-
ments in preventing aggregation and inducing nuclear
localisation of expanded phox2b polyalanine tracts,
we have also demonstrated a signiﬁcant though variable
degree of rescue in the ability of mutant phox2b pro-
teins to transactivate the dβh promoter.
these results, and in particular the ability of ga
to clean cells from pre-formed aggregates, suggest that
mechanisms induced by this drug might be consid-
ered as targets for therapeutic relief from respiratory
or other associated symptoms in cchs patients. how-
ever, because of probable side effects of heat shock
response activation (queitsch et al., 2002; rutherford
& lindquist, 1998), and geldanamycin toxicity, as it
has been assessed by facs analysis (50% apopto-
sis in cells added for 5 days with ga), investiga-
tions on proper animal models will be necessary to
assess geldanamycin effects in vivo. encouraging results,
suggesting a possible geldanamycin-based therapeutic
approach, have recently been obtained by treating a
mouse model of huntington’s disease with ga (hay
et al., 2004), and speciﬁcally with 17-allylamino-17-
demethoxygeldanamycin (17-aag), a molecule char-
acterized by lower toxicity, at present in phases i and
ii clinical trial for cancer chemotherapy (chiosis et al.,
2003; heath et al., 2005) and already demonstrated to be
effective in preventing polyglutamine-mediated motor
neuron degeneration in spinal bulbar muscular atrophy
(waza et al., 2005). moreover, the reduction of aggre-
gate formation and toxicity induced by mutant pabpn1
in mice after treatment with the disaccharide trehalose,
shown to inhibit the formation of amyloid (arora et al.,
2004), represents the ﬁrst observation in vivo providing
clues to potential therapies for a polyalanine expansions
associated disorder (davies, berger, et al., 2006; davies,
sarkar, et al., 2006).
several evidences have shown the involvement of
the ubiquitin–proteasome system in neurodegenera-
tive disorders (abu-baker et al., 2003; adachi et al.,
2000). despite the aggregate-prone proteins are nor-
mally expected to be cleared by this pathway, a process,
termed autophagy and characterized by bulk degrada-
tion in the lytic cell compartments, has recently been
demonstrated to play a role in polyalanine aggregates
degradation (ravikumar et al., 2002).
data presented here on inhibition of the proteasome
machinery and autophagy provide the ﬁrst evidence of
the involvement of these mechanisms in the clearance
of misfolded phox2b proteins in the cchs pathogen-
esis. both lactacystin and 3-methyladenine treatments
have shown to increase the proportion of cells character-
ized by phox2b(+13ala) aggregates in the cytosolic
compartment. such an increased amount of phox2b
inclusions was consistent with results obtained for the
pabpn1 gene in oculopharyngeal muscular dystro-
phy (opmd) following cell treatments with lactacystin
(abu-baker et al., 2003), and with ﬁndings obtained by
treating polyglutamine and polyalanine aggregate-prone
proteins with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
(ravikumar et al., 2002). moreover, rapamycin, an
autophagy induction drug, has resulted to enhance clear-
ance of polyglutamine- and polyalanine-cell aggregates
(berger et al., 2006; ravikumar et al., 2002). by using
rapamycin, we have been able to conﬁrm the role of
autophagy in maintaining phox2b balance; in partic-
ular, although simultaneous inhibition of proteasome
activity seem to decrease the effect of rapamycin, the
ﬁnal outcome of this combined treatment has resulted
in a signiﬁcant proportion of cells presenting a correct
localisation of the phox2b mutant protein.
differently from the effect of autophagy inhibitors,
proteasome impairment has resulted in the formation of
large cytosolic aggresomes formed by a pericentriolar
core containing the misfolded protein surrounded by a
cage of rearranged ﬁlaments of vimentin. this obser-
vation is in accordance with the notion that aggresome
formation represents a general cellular response which
occurs when the capacity of the proteasome is exceeded
by the production of aggregation-prone misfolded pro-
teins (johnston et al., 1998), as already observed in
association with neurodegenerative polyglutamine dis-
orders (shimohata et al., 2002). in particular, proteasome
inhibition has been observed to induce the formation of
perinuclear aggresomes containing the disease-related
prion protein prpc (kristiansen et al., 2005).
since the ubiquitin–proteasome system is emerging
as a critical player in protein misfolding disorders, the
ﬁnding of drugs aimed at improving its function in neu-
t. bachetti et al. / the international journal of biochemistry & cell biology 39 (2007) 327–339

ronal cells may provide a mean for the therapeutic control
of the cchs outcome.
our work provides a link between protein folding
and degradation mechanisms. recent studies have shown
that hsp90 complexes can be found under either the
proteasome-targeting form (associated with hsp70 and
hop) or the stabilizing form (associated with cdc37
and p23) (neckers, 2002) and that hsp90 inhibitors
would act by either shifting such complexes towards the
proteasome-targeting form or inducing the hsp activ-
ity (waza et al., 2006). the hypothesis that phox2b
could be a “hsp90 client protein”, suggested by co-
localisation of phox2b polyalanine aggregates with
hsp70 (trochet, hong, et al., 2005), is conﬁrmed by
our observation that the treatment of cells expressing the
mutant protein with the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin
induces some degrees of proteasome mediated degra-
dation. in particular, analysis of mutant protein level
performed by western blot has shown that geldanamycin
induces a decrease in the amount of phox2b(+13ala),
likely due to proteasome-mediated degradation, as sug-
gested by impairment of correct nuclear localisation fol-
lowing geldanamycin + lactacystin treatment.
therefore, as the polyalanine expanded phox2b
protein is partially reduced and not completely elim-
inated by mechanisms induced by geldanamycin, the
rescue of the correct nuclear localisation is likely the
result of both induction of hsp70, leading to a correct
folding of the mutant protein, and proteasome-mediated
degradation, decreasing the amount of misfolded pro-
tein.
while protein aggregates have turned out to be toxic,
thus leading to cell death, in most of the polyglu-
tamine tract associated pathologies (michalik & van
broeckhoven, 2003; ravikumar et al., 2002; zoghbi &
orr, 2000), at today, apoptosis due to exceeding mis-
folded polyalanine aggregation has been demonstrated in
two diseases only. in particular, polyalanine tract expan-
sions of the arx gene induce formation of intranuclear
inclusions resulted in increased cell death in infantile
spasms and mental retardation syndrome (nasrallah et
al., 2004), while caspase 8-mediated apoptosis has been
reported in cells expressing pabpn1 with 11 extra-
alanine residues in opmd (giri et al., 2003).
in the attempt to understand further the pathogenetic
effect of phox2b polyalanine aggregates in cchs, we
have investigated their potential cellular toxicity. micro-
scope ﬂuorescence analysis has shown an increase of
disrupted nuclear morphology in cells containing aggre-
gates due to the expression of the dup39 construct,
compared to cells expressing the wild type protein, start-
ing from 2 days after transfection and progressing in
intensity up to 7 days of cell culture. since working
under transient conditions, we could not carry on the
analysis further because of drastic release of plasmids
from cells at longer times. these data were conﬁrmed,
although at less extent, by facs analysis which showed
increased apoptosis in association with expression of
phox2b(+13ala) and no signiﬁcant toxic effect in cells
transfected with the shortest phox2b mutants. this
result is also in accordance with the highest percentage of
aggregates in cells expressing the +13ala protein, where
they likely mediate the cell toxic effects. moreover, the
correlation between cell apoptosis and aggregates accu-
mulation has also been conﬁrmed by the observation of a
marked increase of apoptotic cells following proteasome
inhibition (not shown).
finally, facs analysis of apoptosis suggested an
important function of geldanamycin in preventing cell
death.
in particular, despite its toxic effects, gel-
danamycin treatment of cells expressing phox2b
(+13ala) induced a selective decrease of the percentage
of cells in advanced stages of apoptosis, suggesting that
this drug protects damaged cells against the ﬁnal frag-
mentation step probably by delaying their progression
toward the death process. despite we cannot establish
yet whether aggregate formation is the initial step of
diseases or it is a cellular strategy to inactivate toxic
nuclear forms of mutated proteins (sisodia, 1998), our in
vitro experiments, showing a low level of toxicity associ-
ated with phox2b polyalanine aggregates, suggest that
cchs pathogenesis is likely due to neuronal dysfunction
rather than to a massive cell loss.
finally, though generation of a proper mouse model
seems to be the only practicable way to clarify the cellu-
lar responses and especially the fate of cells expressing
polyalanine expanded phox2b, the rescue of cell via-
bility following treatments with hsp90 inhibitors could
be evaluated as a potential therapeutic tool also for
polyalanine expansion mediated cchs symptoms.
