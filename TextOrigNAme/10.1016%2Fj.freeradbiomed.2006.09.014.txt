abstract
deletions within the mitochondrial dna (mtdna) cause kearns sayre syndrome (kss) and chronic progressive external opthalmoplegia
(cpeo). the clinical signs of kss include muscle weakness, heart block, pigmentary retinopathy, ataxia, deafness, short stature, and dementia.
the identical deletions occur and rise exponentially as humans age, particularly in substantia nigra. deletions at >30% concentration cause deficits
in basic bioenergetic parameters, including membrane potential and atp synthesis, but it is poorly understood how these alterations cause the
pathologies observed in patients. to better understand the consequences of mtdna deletions, we microarrayed six cell types containing mtdna
deletions from kss and cpeo patients. there was a prominent inhibition of transcripts encoding ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activity, and a
prominent induction of transcripts involved in the amp kinase pathway, macroautophagy, and amino acid degradation. in mutant cells, we
confirmed a decrease in proteasome biochemical activity, significantly lower concentration of several amino acids, and induction of an autophagic
transcript. an interpretation consistent with the data is that mtdna deletions increase protein damage, inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome system,
decrease amino acid salvage, and activate autophagy. this provides a novel pathophysiological mechanism for these diseases, and suggests
potential therapeutic strategies.

introduction
mitochondrial deletions cause kss, cpeo, and ps
mitochondrial dna deletions (δmtdna), when present at
concentrations of 30% and greater in muscle tissue, can cause
three disorders, kearns-sayre syndrome (kss), chronic progres-
sive external opthalmoplegia (cpeo), and pearson's syndrome

(ps) [1–3]. clinical signs include muscle weakness, exercise
intolerance, droopy eyelids and weakness of ocular muscles
(cpeo), plus heart block, pigmentary retinopathy, ataxia, deaf-
ness, and dementia (kss), and sideroblastic anemia (ps).
diagnosis is usually confirmed by muscle histochemistry,
showing ragged red fibers, and mosaic cytochrome oxidase
negativity.
deletions vary in size (1.3–8 kb) and position within the
mitochondrial genome and occur with higher frequency at direct
repeats [4,5]. the amount of the deleted mtdna is the most
important determinant of clinical severity; the size and location
of deletion are not [6–8].
origin of mtdna deletions is twofold
mtdna deletions are acquired through two main mechan-
isms. single, sporadic deletions of mtdna are thought to occur

somatically early in development, as spontaneous errors of the
gamma polymerase, and the identical deletion is observed in
multiple tissues [9]. alternatively, patients may inherit nuclear
“mutator” alleles in the germline of
the mitochondrial
polymerase gamma, the mitochondrial helicase twinkle, and
the adenine nucleotide translocator, which promote multiple
mtdna deletions of various lengths and cause mendelian
disorders dominated by cpeo [10–12].
mtdna deletions also occur spontaneously and rise
exponentially with normal aging
deletions also occur and accumulate exponentially with
human age, particularly in nonmitotic tissues [13]. although
in most tissues the level of mtdna deletions is in the aged is
less than 5% of the total,
levels reach 5% in some aged
muscles, and 50% in aged substantia nigra [14–18]. these
deletions occur as spontaneous errors in individual cells as a
consequence of age, and rise in concentration over time, with
each cell containing a different predominant deletion species.
age-dependent mtdna deletions have also been correlated
with respiratory chain defects in muscle and substantia nigra
[19–24].
the pathogenetic mechanism of kss and cpeo is unclear
although the occurrence of mitochondrial deletions was first
documented in 1988 [1], and several experiments have shown
that “thresholds” of 30% (in patients) and 60% (in hela cells)
have to be surpassed for a biochemical effect to become evident
[25,26], it is still uncertain how mitochondrial deletions trigger
the pathophysiological cascade; even with the advent of a
mouse model [27,28], the pathogenetic mechanism of kss/
cpeo is still unclear.
the two main pathophysiological mechanisms proposed for
the occurrence of the cpeo/kss/ps phenotypes involve a
decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics [26] plus an increased
production of reactive oxygen species (ros), which may
reinforce the bioenergetic defect through oxidative damage to
dna, proteins, and lipids [29–33].
to clarify the cellular
however, in addition to their well-known role in respira-
tion and oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria are also
sites for mitochondrial protein synthesis, and for such diverse
cellular functions as apoptosis, heme, urea and amino acid
biosynthesis, ion homeostasis, and fatty acid oxidation, all of
which might be involved in the pathophysiological mechan-
ism [34–37].
in order
response to mtdna
deletions, we investigated by oligonucleotide microarray the
global gene expression profile of nuclear-encoded genes in
muscle biopsies, myoblasts, fibroblasts, and lymphoblast cell
lines from controls and patients with cpeo or kss. we
also investigated transmitochondrial cybrids with preneuronal
nt2 or 143b osteosarcoma nuclear background and
harboring different mtdna deletions. the significance of
the mechanisms
suggested by the microarray data is
discussed.
materials and methods
cell lines and culture conditions
we studied different cell
types coming from patients
harboring a single 4.9-kb mtdna deletion and from age- and
sex-matched healthy subjects. muscle cells were snap-frozen
and kept at −80°c until rna isolation. fibroblasts were
cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs), 100 mm pyruvate, 5 mg/ml uridine, and 50 mg/ml
gentamycin. lymphoblasts were grown in rpmi 1640 medium
(life technologies) supplemented with 15% fbs, 50 mm
sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm uridine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin. myoblasts were cultured in skeletal
muscle basal medium (skbm) supplemented with hegf, 10%
fbs, and l-glutamine (cambrex bio science walkersville,
inc.). transmitochondrial cybrids containing either nt2 or
143b osteosarcoma nuclear backgrounds were created as
previously described [38]. briefly, enucleation of mitochondria
donor cells (lymphoblasts for nt2 cybrids and fibroblasts 143b
cybrids) was carried out using the treatment of 15 × 106 cells
with 10 μg/ml cytochalasin-b for 1 h at 37°c. enucleated cells
were mixed with mitochondrial-depleted cells (nt2 rho-zero
and 143b rho-zero) and then treated with 0.2 ml 40%
polyethylene glycol (peg) for 45 s, suspended in dmem
media, and plated. two weeks later the visible colonies were
expanded and checked for mtdna deletion and nuclear
background with at
three microsatellites. in order to
exclude fusion-specific effects on gene transcriptions, we used
fusion control cell lines (fc) created by fusing rho-zero cells
with mitochondria donor cells (lymphoblasts and fibroblasts,
for nt2 and 143b cybrids, respectively) bearing mtdna with
no disease-related mutations. two nt2 control cybrids and
three 143b control cybrids (hga13, hpc7, and h1959, kindly
provided by a. martinuzzi) were utilized, as described
elsewhere [39]. two nt2 mutant cybrids harboring the 4.9-kb
“common deletion,” three 143b mutant cybrids harboring the
4.9-kb deletion (14.6, 51-18 kind gifts of y.h. wei and
bh.10.59 from c. moraes), two 143b mutant cybrids harboring
a 7.5-kb deletion (16.3 and δh.2.1 kind gifts from c. moraes),
and one 143b rho-zero cell line (kindly donated by m. zeviani)
were used. all cybrid cell
lines were cultured in dmem
supplemented with 10% fbs, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm
uridine, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
parental osteosarcoma 143b cells (one line purchased from
atcc and one line a kind gift from g. attardi) were cultured in
the same medium. all
in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 at 37°c and
frequently tested for mycoplasma infection using the myco-
sensor pcr testing protocol (stratagene).

oligonucleotide microarray analysis
microarray analysis was performed as previously described
[40]. briefly, total rna was isolated from cell lines and frozen

muscle tissues using a quiagen rneasy mini kit (valencia, ca).
double-stranded cdna was synthesized from 10 μg of purified
total rna using the superscript choice system (invitrogen,
gaithersburg, md) and t7-(dt)24 primer (genset, la jolla, ca).
the crna was prepared and biotin-labeled using the cdna as a
template for an in vitro transcription (enzo farmingdale, ny).
the labeled crna was randomly fragmentated by heating at
95°c for 35 min in a fragmentation buffer (40 mm tris acetate,
ph 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium
acetate) prior to hybridization to the chips. the chips were then
washed, stained with avidin-labeled phycoerytherin, and
scanned with an affymetrix genechip scanner. raw data
were processed by microarray suite 4.0 (affymetrix) and
microarray data files analyzed using dna-chip analyzer
(dchip) software [41].
fifty-four affymetrix hu95av2genechips (affymetrix,
santa clara, ca) were utilized (tables 1 and 7): 11 for muscle
biopsies (7 patients and 4 controls), 4 for lymphoblasts (2 patients
and 2 controls), 6 for fibroblasts (4 patients and 3 controls), 6 for
nt2 cybrids (2 mutants in duplicate and 2 fusion controls), 9 for
143b cybrids (2 mutants with 5-kb deletion in duplicate, 2
mutants with 7.5-kb deletion in duplicate and 3 fusion controls,
two of them in duplicate), and 8 for 143b cells (2 for 143b rho
zero and 6 for 2 parental 143b cell
lines in triplicate).
differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing
genechips designated as baseline (muscles, myoblasts, fibro-
blasts, and lymphoblasts from healthy subjects, fusion control
cell lines, and parental 143b cells) with the ones that represent
the experimental parameters (muscles, myoblasts, fibroblasts,
and lymphoblasts from patients, mutant cybrids, and 143b rho
zero cells) using a difference in mean fluorescence ≥30 and a p
value < 0.05 (table 1). to determine whether the significant
altered genes deviated from random expectation with respect to
biochemical pathway, cellular compartment, or molecular
function, we used the program onto-express (oe) [42].
quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase pcr (qrt-pcr)
the same total rna utilized for microarray analysis was
used to create cdna for quantitative rt-pcr examination of
six selected genes. superscript reverse transcriptase ii (invitro-
gen, gaithersburg, md) was used and pcr was performed with
roche lightcycler

40 cycles. samples were quantified by generating a standard
curve of a synthesized target from the control cell lines. each
sample was run in triplicates and normalized to beta-actin
expression.
immunoblot and elisa assay immunoblot assay
the cell lysis buffer used for preparing total cell extracts was
a modified ripa buffer (50 mm tris, ph 7.4, 100 mm nacl,
10 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, 1% igepal) supplemented with
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (sigma, st. louis, mo)
added just before use. cells were washed twice with pbs and
lysed for 30 min at 4°c. the homogenate was centrifuged for
30 min at 16,000g and the supernatants were saved for
immunoblot. equal quantities of proteins, as determined by
bradford protein assay, were separated by electrophoresis in a
4–20% sds-polyacrylamide gel (biorad, hercules, ca). anti-
syntaxin 16 (rabbit antiserum, synaptic system) and anti-beta-
actin (mouse monoclonal, sigma) were used as primary
antibodies with the suitable hrp-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies. bound antibodies on nitrocellulose (amersham bios-
ciences) membranes were detected using the chemiluminescent
substrate ecl (amersham biosciences). densitometry analysis
was performed using quantity one software (bio-rad).
measurement of proteasome activity
quantitative in vitro analysis of 20s proteasome activity was
performed by measuring the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic
peptidyl substrate suc-leu-leu-val-tyr-amc (calbiochem, la
jolla ca). testing was assayed in 143b mutant cybrids with
7.5-kb mtdna deletions and 143b fusion controls as well as in
patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines harboring a single 4.9-kb
mtdna deletion and lymphoblasts from age- and sex-matched
healthy subjects. low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate
(sds) were added in order to induce conformational changes
allowing access to the central cavity where the active sites
residues reside. briefly, approximately 3 million cells were
lysed and incubated for 1 h at 37°c in 500 mm hepes, ph 7.6,
10 mm edta, 3% sds, and 200 μm of the substrate suc-leu-
leu-val-tyr-amc. the substrate, cleaved by the chymotryptic-
like activity of the proteasome, released free amc (7-amino-4-
methylcoumarin) which was detected using a fluorimeter (ex
380 nm; em 460 nm). a standard curve was generated using
amc. results are presented as fluorescence over time (nm/ mg
protein/ 60 min).
amino acid analysis (aaa)
lymphoblast cell lines from patients and controls were used.
the samples were acidified with sulfosalicyclic acid (ssa, 3%
final concentration) to precipitate any intact protein prior to
analysis and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°c. aaa
in the supernatants was performed using a beckman 6300
amino acid analyzer (beckman instruments, inc., palo alto,
ca) which utilize a lithium citrate buffer system [43]. amino
acids separation by ion-exchange chromatography was

followed by a “post-column” ninhydrin reaction detection
system. the standard injection volume was 50.0 μl. ami-
noethylcysteine (aecys) was used as internal standards to
correct for any variation in the operating conditions of the
analyzer over time. a data file comprised of a series of
absorbance values vs time points was generated during each
chromatographic run. the values corresponding to the mutant
samples were compared to the control ones; fold changes and p
values between the two groups are presented in table 5.
statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean and standard deviation (sd).
comparisons between groups were performed by two-tailed
unpaired student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. data were analyzed using graphpad-
prism software (prism 4.0, graphpad software, inc.).
results
several transcriptional consequences of deletions are
significantly shared
complementary rna (crna) was prepared from 54
samples, labeled, and microarrayed on 54 chips. cell types
included differentiated muscle, myoblasts, fibroblasts, lympho-
blasts, nt2 cybrids, and 143b osteosarcoma cybrids (table 1).
we also compared the results with those obtained with 143b
osteosarcoma rho-zero cells, which lack mtdna completely, as
the transcriptional consequences were similar to those observed
in 143b cybrids bearing mtdna deletions.
to identify the most consistent consequences of mtdna
deletions across cell types, we looked for transcripts that were
significantly different at the p≤0.10 criterion in each of the
seven experiments of mutants and controls. thus, the combined
probability for observing the same gene altered in the same
direction across n experiments is: {(0.10)(0.5)}n. for example,
the nominal p value for a single transcript to be shared among
four experiments at the p≥0.10 criterion in the same direction is
(0.05)4, i.e., p≤0.0000063, p≤6.3 × 10−6 [44].
mtdna deletions cause transcriptional inhibition
several transcripts were nonrandomly shared among experi-
ments (table 2). in addition, mtdna deletions caused about
twice as many shared downregulated than upregulated tran-
scripts. for example, 38 transcripts were shared and down-
regulated vs 17 shared and upregulated among five
experiments, 230 down vs 109 up among four experiments,

and 983 down vs 684 up among three experiments. thus, it is
clear from the most consistently altered transcripts that in cells
harboring mitochondrial deletions there are more nuclear gene
inhibitions than activations by a ratio of approximately 2:1,
when similar categories are compared.
pathway analysis shows inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome
and mitochondrial transcripts
the onto-express bioprocess program objectively reveals
the predominance of particular biochemical pathways in
microarray data [42]. using lists encompassing the broadest
and most consistent consequences of mtdna deletions (i.e.,
genes significantly altered in the same direction across four
experiments), we analyzed the pathways emphasized by the
bioprocess function of onto-express (table 3).
onto-express identified the following pathways as sig-
nificantly inhibited: ubiquitin-proteasome (corrected p
value < 0.0007), mitochondrial atp synthesis (p < 0.006), and
initiation of protein synthesis (p < 0.007). by contrast, intra-
golgi transport, cell cycle arrest, and negative regulation of cell
proliferation were significantly activated.
negative transcriptional consequences of mtdna deletions:
proteasomal, mitochondrial, synthetic, and muscle-specific
genes
of
the transcripts shared and downregulated in cells
harboring mtdna deletions in >3 experiments (table 4),
two prominent clusters were evident by inspection, which had
been previously identified by the onto-express analysis. first,
many members of the ubiquitin-proteasomal complex were

downregulated, including the proteasome (psmb6, psme3,

ube2e1,ube2l6, ube2i, ube3b, usp7, usp10, usp22,
usp15, usp33, ubr2, cand2) systems. thus, mtdna
deletions cause a strong and significant inhibition of many
transcripts involved in ubiquitin proteasome activity.
second, and also consistent with the onto-express results,
many mitochondrially targeted transcripts were inhibited,
including those that encode subunits of complex i, nadh
dehydrogenase (ndufa5, ndufa6, ndufaf1, ndufb3,
ndufs3, ndufv2), complex ii (sdhc, sdhb), genes
involved in the assembly of complex iv (surf1,surf2), and
complex v (atp5g2, atp5h, atp5j2), tca cycle genes
(dld, slc25a1, aco2, idh3g), mitochondrial ribosomal
genes (iars2, mrpl28, mrps18b, mrpl23), and a
mitochondrial antioxidant gene (sod2). thus, mtdna dele-
tions result in inhibition of nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial-
targeted proteins.
mtdna deletions activate snare genes, stress genes, myc,
and amino acid degradation transcripts
we inspected the lists of genes shared and activated in ≥3
experiments (table 6), searching for functional clusters. in
agreement with the onto-express analysis, several snare
genes involved in intra-golgi and vesicular transport were
induced in mutants, including syntaxin 16, tgoln2, arh-
gef, golga8a, raftlin, vapb, atp6v0e2l, vps13a,
suggesting an increase in vesicular activity.
multiple stress-related genes of different categories were
also induced in three or more experiments, including genes
involved in the unfolded protein stress response (perk,
hspa4, dnajc3, and dnajc4). stress genes related to
energy depletion were also induced in mutants (prkaa,
atg12, gatm), as were hypoxia-responsive genes (ugcg,
adm, stc2). adm and stc2 are each targets of hif1alpha,
which was significantly induced in two experiments. stress
genes related to nonsense-mediated decay (smg1, dicer1)
were also induced. these results suggest increased stress in
general
including
unfolded protein stress, energy depletion stress, and hypoxic
stress. the stress category was not flagged by onto-express,
probably because these sets of genes belong to separate stress
pathways.
in cells with mitochondrial deletions,
the myc gene was also induced in mutants. myc, which
has recently been shown to serve as a transcription factor for
mitochondrial biogenesis, and responds to mitochondrial
functional depletion [40,44–47].
several transcripts encoding enzymes that degrade amino
acids were also induced, including gcat, metap2, gls,
aass, lox. this suggests an increase in amino acid
scavenging.

obvious by inspection of the inhibited gene lists, we first
confirmed the downregulation at the rna level by measuring
the proteasomal catalytic 26s subunit through quantitative rt-
pcr (fig. 1). we then carried out a functional analysis of
proteasome activity in 143b osteosarcoma cybrids harboring a
7.5-kb deletion and in lymphoblasts from patients carrying a 5-
kb mtdna deletion (fig. 2). in agreement with microarray
results, we observed decreased proteasomal activity in both
mutant cell types.
amino acid concentration is deficient in mutant lymphoblasts
proteasome activity is both important for normal degradation
of proteins and for providing a substantial fraction of amino
acids required for protein synthesis [48]. we compared amino
acid concentration in two sets of lymphoblast cells harboring 5-
and 7.5-kb mtdna deletions and in control lymphoblasts, and
found that 15 out of 20 standard amino acids tested were
significantly decreased while one (aspartate) was only mildly
increased. in addition, five nonstandard amino acids were also
less in mutant lymphoblasts than in controls. all decreased
acids are shown in table 5.
induction of the autophagy 12 transcript is a specific
consequence of mtdna deletions
the atg12 transcript encodes the first and most important
product of the autophagy pathway [49,50], and was induced in the
microarray data from fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, and myoblasts
from kss patients, and in nt2 neural cells bearing deletions. as
depletion of steady-state concentrations of amino acids is known
to induce autophagy [51,52], the induction of atg12 could relate
to significant decreases in several amino acids that we observed in
the mutant cells. to determine whether the induction of atg12
was a specific consequence of mtdna deletions, we quantified
atg12 transcript levels in 143b osteosarcoma cybrid fusion
controls (i.e., cell lines that had gone through the process of
cybridization but with normal mtdna), in osteosarcoma cybrids
harboring deletions, and in osteosarcoma cell lines lacking the
mitochondrial genome (fig. 3). the atg12 transcript levels were
highly correlated with the presence of deletions, were significantly

increase in syntaxin 16 protein
both inspection of the microarray data and the onto-express
analysis suggested an increase in vesicular activity in the mutant
cells (table 6). stx16 is a t-snare (snap receptors)
molecule involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion,
found in the golgi and trans-golgi network and essential for
autophagy [53–55].
immunoblot analysis confirmed an
increased expression of stx16 in 143b cybrids and 143b

deletions in six cell types. because deletions erase essential
parts of the mitochondrial protein synthetic machinery (i.e.,
trnas)
the
respiratory chain complexes that produce energy and other
metabolites for the cell (fig. 5), we expected a strong “nuclear
response” to the “mitochondrial stimulus.”
[58,61] as well as essential components of
single mtdna deletions produce inhibition of multiple
mitochondrial transcripts
since the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes exist symbio-
tically, and coencode several multisubunit complexes, it was
interesting to see that mtdna deletions had a strong negative
effect on nuclear-encoded mitochondrially targeted genes. this
was especially evident on complex i transcripts, but also on
complex ii and complex iv assembly genes, on complex v, on
several tca cycle genes, and on components of
the
mitochondrial ribosome. these data suggest that the nucleus
senses the irreversible depletion of mtdna-encoded mitochon-
drial subunits and trnas, and responds by down-regulating the
interacting subunits that would normally form a functional
complex. the downregulation of nuclear-encoded mitochon-
drial ribosomal subunits, oxphos, and tca cycle transcripts
thus appears to reinforce the mitochondrial defect initiated by
the deletions, and add to the mitochondrial metabolic defect in
the patients.
the depletion of mitochondrial function has recently been
shown to induce myc overexpression, and we also observed a
substantial upregulation of myc in cells bearing mtdna
deletions [40,44–47,62]

increase in oxidized proteins in mutant cells
since deletions erase not only trnas but also mitochond-
rially encoded subunits of the respiratory chain, it would not be
unexpected if misfolding of electron transport chain complexes
caused increased oxidative damage to proteins. thus we
measured oxidatively modified proteins using the oxyblot
method. there were significantly more oxidized proteins in
cells bearing mtdna deletions than fusion controls,
i.e.,
controls that had been through the cybridization process with
normal mtdna.
discussion
single mtdna deletions cause kss, cpeo, or ps, whose
affected tissues show impaired electron transport activity, atp
production, and mitochondrial protein synthesis [26,56,57].
muscle biopsies from patients with kss or cpeo show ragged-
red fibers and cytochrome oxidase-negative fibers [58,59].
clinical signs vary widely in different syndromes but include
muscle weakness, heart block, retinopathy, deafness, diabetes,
short stature, and dementia [2,60]. we have used microarray in
an attempt to link the primary cause of kss/cpeo/ps with
cellular, morphological, and clinical consequences. we exam-

was not observed in a larger microarray study of other
mitochondrial diseases, including friedreich's ataxia, leber's
hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged
red fibers, and neuropathy, ataxia , and retinitis pigmentosa
[44]. thus, it seems likely that inhibition of the proteasomal
transcripts is a direct consequence of mtdna deletions.
decreased amino acid concentration in mutant cells
one potential consequence of decreased ubiquitin protease
activity is decreased salvage of amino acids, and recently the
proteasome has been shown to be an important provider of

fig. 5. deletion sites within mtdna. deletions of mtdna may occur within a
certain region (shown in light blue). the deleted genes code for respiratory chain
subunits of complex i (nd3, nd4, nd4l, nd5, and nd6), complex iii (cyt b),
complex iv (coii and coiii), and complex v (atpase 6 and 8). the deletions
may erase also transfer rna genes (indicated in red) such as s, d, k, g, r, h, s, l,
e, t, and p.
deletions inhibit the ubiquitin and proteasome system
deletions of the mitochondrial genome erase not only
subunits of the respiratory chain that must cooperate with
nuclear-encoded subunits [63] but also trnas necessary for
mitochondrial protein synthesis [57].
deletion of specific mtrnas not only decreases mito-

damage.
although it has been known for some time that mildly
damaged mitochondrial proteins are degraded by the protea-
some, it has not been appreciated until recently that heavily
damaged mitochondrial proteins inhibit the proteasome [66–
70]. thus, the very strong inhibition of many subunits of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system is likely a consequence of
misfolded and damaged mitochondrial proteins specified by
the mtdna deletions. also, recent studies have demonstrated
that mtdna deletions increase ros production, which would
seem to compound the misfolding/damage problem [31]. to test
these ideas, we measured oxidative damage to proteins by the
oxyblot method, and observed a >300% increase in oxidized
proteins. thus, mtdna deletions result not only in increased
protein oxidative damage but also decreased proteasome
activity.
the downregulation of the proteasome microarray signal
appears to be a unique consequence of mtdna deletions, as it

amino acids for protein synthesis, specifically under conditions
of minimal nutrient status [48].
consistent with this prediction, we observed a significant
and substantial decrease in steady-state amino acid concentra-
tion in mutant cells, and significant increases in transcripts that
encode several amino acid-degrading enzymes, possibly as a
response to amino acid depletion.
induction of autophagy transcript in mutant cells
(table 6), and the degree of upregulation was correlated with
deletion status in the osteosarcoma cell line (fig. 3). it has
recently been shown that autophagy is induced in response to
impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system activity [71,72]. also, it
is known that low amino acid concentration triggers autophagy
via inhibition of mtor, thus providing a possible pathogenic
mechanism for kss: deletions > misfolding > proteasome inhi-
bition > aa depletion > mtor inhibition > autophagy,
inhibi-
tion of protein synthesis and of cell growth.
deletions erase essential
trna genes responsible for
decoding mitochondrial rna transcripts, which should result
in irreparable protein damage. since proteasomal activity is
inhibited in cells with deletions, this raises the question of how
the cell may deal with mitochondria carrying irreparable protein
damage. atg12, which is the first and most important gene in
the mammalian autophagy cascade [49,50], was upregulated in
response to deletions, as shown by microarray across cell lines
autophagy requires the action of snare and vesicular
proteins
consistent with the hypothesis of an induction of autophagy
in mutant cells, we observed the induction of several snare/
vesicular transcripts, syntaxin 16 (stx16, tgoln2, arh-
gef, golga8a, vapb, atp6v0e2l, vps13a). induction
of snare proteins is essential for the process of autophagy

fig. 6. a mechanistic hypothesis for the consequences of mtdna deletions. expected consequences of mtdna deletions. deletions must perforce erase essential
trnas and components of multisubunit complexes of the oxphos chain, and result in increased protein oxidative damage. increased protein oxidative damage has
been demonstrated to inhibit ubiquitin-proteasomal activity, which is expected to decrease the rate of salvage of amino acids, and result in decreased amino acid
concentration in cells, which has previously been demonstrated to decrease the activity of mtor, which then represses protein synthesis and activates autophagy.
deletions were shown to result in decreased expression of nuclear-encoded oxphos complex (of both the electron transport chain and the atp synthase), which must
also inhibit atp synthesis (which has been demonstrated at the biochemical level by others), and stimulate the activity of amp kinase, which then should inhibit
mtor, which should result in the inhibition of protein synthesis and the activation of autophagy [52].
is possible that
[53,73–75]. thus it
the subsarcolemmal
proliferation of mitochondria observed in kss/cpeo and
revealed by the gomori trichrome stain in ragged-red fibers is in
fact the result of increased autophagic activity.
amino acid deprivation induces autophagy
amino acid deprivation is known to induce autophagy via
inhibition of
the mtor pathway [51,52]. amino acid
deprivation is also known to signal gcn2 and stimulate
eif2-alpha phosphorylation [76–78], resulting in increased
expression of unfolded protein response (upr) genes and
endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress-related genes, many of
which are induced in mutant cells. both the inhibition of mtor
and the phosphorylation of eif2 alpha should result in the
inhibition of protein synthesis transcripts that we observe in the
microarray data.
a pathogenetic mechanism for kss
mtdna deletions remove trnas and functional compo-
nents of the respiratory chain. the resulting mitochondrial
protein damage has multiple consequences. perhaps as a
result of oxidative protein damage, one consequence is
inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system, which may
cause amino acid depletion through decreased amino acid
salvage. a second generally accepted consequence is the
reduction of atp synthesis [26,79]; atp depletion is known
to activate the ampk response [80] as a protective
mechanism. both amino acid depletion and ampk activation
can result
in inhibition of mtor [51,81] which in turn
inhibits translation, protein synthesis, and cellular growth, and
induces autophagy (fig. 6).
implications of the proposed mechanism for kss patients
if this mechanism is correct, it suggests potential interven-
tions for patients harboring mtdna deletions. if the ubiquitin
proteasomal defect
is a primary consequence of mtdna
deletions, as we suspect, and causes the decrease in cellular
amino acid concentration, which in turn signals mtor and
causes decreased protein synthesis transcripts, then supplemen-
tation of free amino acids might benefit the patients, because
amino acids in general (and leucine in particular) are known to
potently stimulate mtor and inhibit autophagy [82–85].
