abstract
nitric oxide (no) is fundamentally important molecule which produces a wide range of cellular eﬀects with the most poorly under-
stood one being alteration in the sensitivity to cell death. the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that no would diﬀeren-
tially aﬀect caspase or autophagy gene expression in a manner that might account for the disparate actions of no to either enhance or
protect against cell death. neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes in culture were treated with the no donor sin-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine
hydrochloride) for up to 20 h. rna was collected, after either 2, 4 or 20 h, labeled and hybridized to cdna microarray slides the con-
centration of sin-1 was selected after concentration response studies of sin-1 on cell viability, assessed by the mtt assay. the cdna
microarrays were used that contained the mouse genome version 2.0 with genes for enzymes crucial to apoptosis, namely caspases-1, -2,
-3, -6, -7, -8, -9, -11, -12 and -14, as well as for enzymes crucial to autophagy namely beclin-1, apg5l and apg12l. considering the entire
20 h period, treatment with sin-1 was associated with signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) changes in ﬁve caspases. in contrast, there were no changes
in the three separate genes involved in autophagy. time course experiments showed a consistent increase in caspase-8, -11 and -14, and a
consistent decrease in caspase-1 and -6. notably, caspase-1 showed a persistent and marked reduction so that after 20 h of treatment,
caspase-1 was dramatically reduced, almost ten fold, to 0.14 ± 0.11 of control. in conclusion, these results suggest that: (i) no regulates
the expression of genes involved in apoptotic but not some involved in autophagic cell death; (ii) the more recently discovered caspase-14
may have a role in the heart; (iii) no-induced alteration of diﬀerent caspases may explain the ability of no to either enhance or protect
against cell death depending on whether associated factors involve, respectively caspases-8, -11, and -14 or -1 and -6.

nitric oxide (no), an important regulator in cell signal-
ing and cell function, plays a crucial but confusing role in
the modulation of cell viability or cell death. no can pro-
mote cell death or inhibit cell death [1–6]. the duality of
the role played by no in cell death has been attributed
to the cellular concentration of no, its combination with
the intracellular environment, and its interactions with
other biological molecules such as oxygen or superoxide
[5]. nevertheless, these explanations may not be adequate
to explain these diametrically opposite eﬀects especially

considering the diﬀerent modes of cell death, each with
its multiple mechanisms.
cell death is of critical importance in cell types that are
essentially terminally diﬀerentiated because the loss of cell
number is translated into a loss of organ function. of the
three major modes of cell death—oncosis or necrosis,
apoptosis and autophagy—apoptosis and autophagy are
highly regulated and subject to genetic control [7]. while
apoptosis can be caspase-independent, the major mecha-
nism for cell death in apoptosis operates through this fam-
ily of cysteine aspartate proteases which cleave proteins
after an aspartate residue and are known as caspases
[8,9]. caspases have been classiﬁed into groups based on
substrate speciﬁcity, structural similarities and function
[8]. while not precise, such classiﬁcations are conceptually
340

useful. caspases have been divided into those that are acti-
vated during apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10)
and those that undergo activation during inﬂammatory
responses (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -11) [10,11]. they can be
further divided into known or hypothetical roles in the cas-
pase cascade, speciﬁcally apical caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9,
and -10) which are thought to be primarily responsible for
initiating caspase-activation cascades, and downstream or
eﬀector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7), which appear to
be responsible for the actual destruction of the cell during
apoptosis. autophagic cell death is less well understood
but is characterized by sequestration of cytoplasm and
organelles in double or multi-membrane autophagic vesi-
cles, and their delivery to and subsequent degradation by
the cell’s own lysosomal system [12]. in some settings,
autophagy and apoptosis
seem to be interconnected
positively or negatively, suggesting ‘molecular switches’
between apoptosis and autophagy [12]. while some investi-
gators contend that autophagy is primarily a pro-survival
rather
than a pro-death mechanism, others disagree
[12,13]. autophagy is regulated by a set of genes discrete
from those regulating caspases. there are approximately
17 gene products essential for autophagy and related path-
ways in yeast, referred to as the atg genes with most of
these having orthologs in higher eukaryotes [14]. amongst
these is the mammalian gene encoding beclin 1, a novel
bcl-2-interacting, coiled-coil protein, with structural simi-
larity to the yeast autophagy gene, apg6/vps30 [15].
while no is recognized to aﬀect caspase activation [16],
there is little data on the eﬀect of no on caspase gene
expression and less on autophagy gene expression. thus
the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that
no would diﬀerentially aﬀect caspase or autophagy gene
expression in a manner that might account for the dispa-
rate actions of no to either enhance or protect against cell
death.
materials and methods
cell culture
neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were cultured from
cd1 mice as described [17]. brieﬂy, 1-day-old mice were
sacriﬁced by decapitation. the heart was excised and trans-
ferred to a petri dish containing dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle
medium, (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (10,000 mg/ml streptomycin
sulfate, 10,000 u/ml penicillin g sodium, and 25 lg/ml
amphotericin b). the atria were removed and the ventricles
manually minced in collagenase solution (1 mg/ml collage-
nase type i, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 lm cacl2
in dmem) into approximately 1 mm2 pieces. the tissue
was then digested with agitation for 7 min at 37 °c. the ini-
tial digestate was discarded, as it contained predominantly
red blood cells and damaged cells. the digestion was repeat-
ed two more times with 2 ml collagenase solution, adding
the digestate to 2 ml of dmem with 10% fcs and 1% anti-
biotic/antimycotic divided between two test tubes, and leav-
ing the large tissue pieces behind. following this, the
remaining tissue was subjected to 5 · 7 min at 37 °c agita-
tion periods in digestion medium (0.005% trypsin, 0.1%
bsa, 1.1 · 105 dornase units dnase in dms8 salt solu-
tion (116 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 0.4 mm nah2po4–
h2o, 0.75 mm na2po4–7 h2o, 5.5 mm glucose in water)),
with the digestate being added to the dmem tubes follow-
ing each period. the digestate was then centrifuged at
1000 g for 5 min to pellet the cells. the supernatant was
then removed and the cell pellet resuspended in dmem
with 10% fcs and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, and incubat-
ed at 37 °c and 5% co2 in 60 mm culture dishes at a density
of 3 · 106 cells per dish, or in 96-well microtitre plates at
30,000 cells per well.
assessment of cell viability (mtt assay)
the mtt assay, an index of cell viability, is based on
the ability of viable cells to reduce mtt (3-[4, 5-dimethyl-
thiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) from a yel-
low water-soluble dye to a dark blue insoluble formazan
product [18]. cardiomyocytes, seeded in multiwell microti-
tre plates and incubated at 37 °c for 72 h, were treated with
drugs or other agents or their diluent and returned to the
incubator for 24 h. mtt dye (promega, madison, wi,
usa), was added to each well for the last 4 h of treatment.
the reaction was stopped with the addition of solubiliza-
tion reagent (promega, madison, wi, usa.) and the opti-
cal density was determined at 570 nm on a multiwell plate
reader (bio-rad model #3550, bio-rad, mississauga, can-
ada) as previously described [4,17]. the absorbance curve
of the mtt dye exhibits a linear portion ranging from
570 to 655 nm. background absorbance of medium in the
absence of cells was subtracted. all samples were assayed
in duplicate and the mean for each experiment was
calculated.
measurement of no by modiﬁcation of greiss assay
no was measured by the modiﬁed greiss assay as pre-
viously outlined [6]. brieﬂy, culture medium, after the treat-
ment period, was removed and it (100 ll) was reacted with
50 ll of sulfanilamide (10 mg/ml in 5% orthophosphoric
acid) and 50 ll of n-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (1 mg/
ml) in a multiwell microtitre plate. similarly, diﬀerent con-
centrations of sodium nitrite were reacted with sulfanil-
amide and n-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine to produce a
 ) concen-
standard curve for determining the nitrite (no2
tration in each sample. the absorbance was measured at a
wavelength of 570 nm on a multiwell plate reader, and the
nitrite concentration in each sample was determined.
gene expression
cells were cultured in dishes for 72 h. at 20, 4, and 2 h
prior to cell collection, sin-1 or diluent was added to the

medium. following the incubation time, cells were collect-
ed and rna isolated with qiagen rneasy mini kit,
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (qiagen, missis-
sauga, canada). rna was resuspended in rnase-free
water,
its concentration assessed by measurement at
260 nm, and kept at  70 °c.
a 3dna array 350ä expression array detection kit
(genisphere, hatﬁeld, penn, usa) was used for labeling
and hybridizing rna to microarray slides. microarray
procedures were followed as outlined in the manufactur-
er’s protocols. cdna microarrays were printed at the
gene array facility at vancouver hospital, based on
the mouse genome version 2.0 and included caspases-1,
-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, -11, -12, and -14 as well as beclin-1,
apg5l and apg12l. procedures were followed as outlined
in the manufacturer’s protocols. cdna was synthesized
from isolated rna. five to ten micrograms of rna
from either controls or treatments were combined with
reverse transcriptase (rt) primer (cy5 for controls, cy3
for treatments) and heated at 80 °c to facilitate anneal-
ing. superase-in rnase inhibitor was added, and then
superscript ii first strand buﬀer (gibco), dntp mix,
dtt, and superscript ii enzyme (gibco) were added.
this was then incubated for 2 h at 42 °c to allow the
reverse transcription of cdna to occur. following this,
naoh/edta was added to stop the reaction. incubation
at 65 °c for 10 min denatured the dna/rna hybrids
and degraded the rna. the reaction was neutralized
by the addition of tris-hcl, ph 7.5. the cdna controls
and treatments from each time point were combined and
concentrated using millipore microconò ym-30 centrifu-
gal filter devices. following concentration, the cdna
was resuspended in a formamide-based hybridization
buﬀer, warmed, and added to a microarray beneath a
sigmacote-treated lifterslip. hybridization of the cdna
to the array was then allowed to proceed overnight in a
dark humidiﬁed chamber at 42 °c. the lifterslip is then
removed and the array washed with a series of ssc/sds
buﬀers and ethanol, and then centrifuged to dry. fluoro-
phores cy3 and cy5 3dna capture reagents were then
mixed with formamide-based hybridization buﬀer and
anti-fade reagent, warmed, added to the array beneath
a lifterslip and then incubated for 2.5–3 h in a dark
humidiﬁed chamber at 45°c. following this hybridiza-
tion, the lifterslip was removed and the arrays washed
with a series of ssc/sds buﬀers and centrifuged to
dry. they were stored in a light-protective box until
scanned.
microarrays were scanned on a perkin elmer micro-
array analysis system utilizing scanarray express version
2.2 software (perkin elmer, fremont, ca, usa) to obtain
the array image ﬁles. array image ﬁles were then analyzed
using imagene 6.0 (biodiscovery, el segundo, ca, usa)
and genespring 7.0 (silicon genetics, palo alto, ca,
usa) software to quantitate the ﬂuorophores’ intensities
at each spot on the array, which corresponds to relative
gene expression values.

results
cardiomyocytes in culture were treated with the no
donor sin-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride)
for 24 h and an assessment of total cell death was used to
characterize the ability of sin-1 to alter cell viability.
sin-1 treatment produced little alteration of mtt absor-
bance at 570 nm at concentrations of 100 lm or less. in
contrast, sin-1 at concentrations of 1000 lm or greater
produced signiﬁcant reductions in absorbance (fig. 1
insert). considering the direct relationship between mtt
absorbance and cardiomyocyte cell number [4,17], the per-
cent change in cell death compared to control was calculat-
ed. sin-1, 1000 lm produced a 75.2 ± 18.2 % increase in
cell death while 10,000 lm produced a 100% increase in
cell death i.e., no viable cells (fig. 1). no-induced cell
death encompasses apoptosis and necrosis or oncosis but
the mtt assay is a good representation of both apoptotic
and necrotic cell death in these cardiomyocytes (4,17).
reproducibility of
the microarray technique was
assessed by comparing the results in the untreated (control)
samples (fig. 2). the average ﬂuorescence intensities of the
caspase spots in the microarray in the untreated (control)
samples (cy5-bound samples), at 2 and 20 h, were correlat-
ed with those observed at 4 h (the midpoint of the experi-
ment). there was
correlation
(r = 0.8925, p < 0.001) indicating a high level of reproduc-
ibility. taken together, these values represent a high conﬁ-
dence in the control spots being consistent between
experimental time points, and denote that any changes seen
in the treatment spots may be safely interpreted as being a
direct result of the treatments themselves.
a highly
signiﬁcant
considering the concentration eﬀect relationship of
sin-1 and cell death (fig. 1), sin-1, 500 lm was selected
as the concentration that would induce only a small
amount of cell death and permit examination of gene
expression in viable cells. sin-1, 500 lm produced
an increase in nitrite in the medium, as measured by the

discussion
our study is the ﬁrst to provide data indicating that no
alters cardiac caspase gene expression and does so in a
diﬀerential manner. caspases -8, -11 and -14 were deﬁnitely
increased and possibly caspase-2 as well, while caspases-1
and -6 were deﬁnitely decreased and caspase-3 showed a
transient decrease in response to no treatment. our data
are supported by experiments in melanoma cells treated
with the speciﬁc inos inhibitor aminoguanidine (amg)
for 24 h,
in which caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-6 gene
expression was increased while caspase-10 was not signiﬁ-
cantly changed [20]. our ﬁnding that no reduces cas-
pase-1, caspase-6 and possibly caspase-3 expression are
consistent with reduction in no generation being associat-
ed with increases in gene expression of these caspases [20].
our study presents novel data, compared to that investiga-
tions [20], as it provides direct evidence on the action of
no by using an eﬀective no donor, examined more than
four caspases, and showed that the eﬀects are directly
attributable to no rather than the product of one nos
isoenzyme which can have speciﬁc subcellular distribution
and discrete cellular eﬀects [21]. in pulmonary artery
endothelial cells,
the no donor noc-18 induced or
repressed genes across diﬀerent families of genes, but only
one caspase appeared to be examined, namely caspase-8
which was increased [22]. tissue speciﬁc diﬀerences in
response to no are important as the responses to no vary
between tissues in part because of the diﬀerent physiologic
function between tissues. the speciﬁcity of no to aﬀect
caspases is suggested by the absence of any change in three
separate genes involved in autophagy namely beclin-1,
apg5l and apg12l.
diﬀerential expression of caspase genes in response to
no provides a novel potential explanation for the duality
of the role of no to promote cell death or inhibit cell death
[2–6]. overall we found no induced cell death in cardio-
myocytes and we suggest that part of the explanation is
due to no-induced increased expression of caspases -8,
-11, and -14. in other circumstances where cell death is
induced by stimuli that involve predominately a central
role for caspase-1 and -6, the presence of no in this setting
decreases caspase-1 and -6 expression and in turn reduces
cardiac cell death. thus diﬀerential caspase gene expression
may account for the apparent paradoxical eﬀect of no to
either increase or decrease cell death.
chromosomal location of caspases does not account for
the action of no on caspase gene expression. the chromo-
somal location of caspase-8 is close to that of caspase-10
[23] yet no altered caspase-8 but had no eﬀect on caspase
10. indeed the caspases aﬀected by no are all on diﬀerent
chromosomes. caspase-8 is located on chromosome 2
(2q33-q34), caspase-14 is located on chromosome 19
(19p13.1), caspase-11 is on chromosome-8 (8q11), cas-
pase-1 on chromosome 11 (11q23) and caspase-6 on chro-
mosome 4 (4q25) [23,24].
caspase-8, an apical or upstream caspase, is a critical
activator of the caspase cascade in some forms of apopto-
sis, namely, the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway. cas-
pase-8 proenzyme is recruited to ligand-activated death
receptor multimers, where it oligomerizes and comprises
344
s.w. rabkin, s.s. klassen / nitric oxide 16 (2007) 339–347
a part of a death-inducing signaling complex (disc), at
which point it is autoactivated and released into the cytosol
to trigger apoptosis [25]. the signiﬁcance of caspase-8 with-
in this pathway is demonstrated whereby targeted disrup-
tion of the caspase-8 gene prevents apoptosis induction
by tnf receptors, fas/apo1, and dr3 [26]. furthermore,
transgenic mice generated with a cardiac-restricted expres-
sion of an ft-binding protein/caspase-8 fusion protein
show massive cardiac myocyte apoptosis and have short-
ened survival times following treatment with the small mol-
ecule fk1012h2, which induces oligomerization of the
binding protein component and leads to autoactivation
of caspase-8 [27]. caspase-8 inhibitors prevent cardiac
myocyte death, cardiac dilation and contractile dysfunction
in this murine model [27]. caspase-8 gene expression is sub-
ject to regulation by factors such as e2f-1 transcription
factor [28]. also, interventions such as irradiation, which
are known to increase no production [29], induce expres-
sion of caspase-8 [30]. thus no mediated induction of cas-
pase-8 gene expression would be anticipated to induce an
increase in cell death. the structure of the human cas-
pase-8 gene is identical to the mouse with regard to exon/
intron organization and exon size [31], and so these exper-
iments are of particular signiﬁcance when extrapolating
results to human.
caspase-11, in contrast to most other caspases, is usual-
ly not constitutively expressed but is readily induced by
pro-inﬂammatory stimuli
[32] or cellular ischemia [33].
transcriptional control of caspase-11 expression is the
dominant mechanism for regulation of caspase-11 because
of its minimal constitutive expression and autoactivation
[34]. this transcriptional control is mediated through vari-
ous factors, but notably nf-jb in response to lps insult
and stat1 in response to ifn-c, both of which bind to
the caspase-11 gene promoter at binding sites upstream
of the transcription initiation site, resulting in upregulation
of the gene product [34]. caspase-11 gene expression is dif-
ferentially regulated compared to caspase-1 [35]. caspase-
11 can activate the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis
[36], and cardiac ischemia followed by reperfusion increas-
es caspase-11 activation through a p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) dependent mechanism [37]. con-
sidering that no is released in myocardial ischemic reper-
fusion injury [38] and no activates p38 mapk [39],
there is reasonable support for the concept of no mediat-
ing increases in caspase-11 gene expression in cardiomyo-
cytes leading to cell death.
caspase-14 is expressed in a broad range of epithelial
cell types including human epidermal, breast, prostate,
and stomach [40] and can be upregulated by transcription-
al activation [41]. to our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst
to suggest the presence of caspase-14 in cardiomyocytes.
caspase-14 is an intriguing caspase as it possesses an
unusually short prodomain, and it preferentially associates
with large prodomain caspases [42,43]. however, unlike
other short prodomain caspases,
it is not activated by
multiple death stimuli [42,43]. similar to other procaspases
it
requires proteolytic processing within its catalytic
domain prior to dimerization and generation of the com-
petent enzyme [44]. interestingly, however, the substrate
preferences for the human and mouse enzymes are diﬀer-
ent, with data suggesting that human caspase-14 is compa-
rable to cytokine activator caspases-1, -4, and -5 while in
the mouse it is more comparable to initiator caspases-8
and -9 [44]. in agreement with this observation, we found
similar expression changes in caspase-14 and caspase-8 in
response to no. this commonality of responses is sup-
ported by data in the brain following reperfusion injury,
in which there is proteolytic processing of both procas-
pase-8 and -14 [45]. nitric oxide production is a major
candidate as a contributor to cell death in the brain in
response to ischemia/hypoxia, as demonstrated by an inhi-
bition of no production being associated with neuropro-
tection [46]. considering this alongside the signiﬁcance of
no in the heart, and also the relative lack or data sur-
rounding caspase-14, we suggest a possible role for cas-
pase-14 in cardiac cell death.
no induced a marked reduction in caspase-1 which
increased with greater treatment times. indeed, the eﬀect
of no on caspase-1 gene expression was consistent and
was most dramatic, being almost a tenth of baseline by
20 h following no treatment. caspase-1 is mainly known
as a controller of crucial components of inﬂammatory
and immune responses, with its activation occurring in
the inﬂammosome [11]. the formation of the inﬂammo-
some, comprising procaspase-1 and -5 as well as the
card-containing protein nalp-1, results in the process-
ing and activation of the cytokines il-1b and il-18, which
play a central role in the immune responses [11]. the tran-
scriptional regulation pattern of caspase-1 has received lit-
tle attention. the p53-related protein p73 has been
observed to regulate caspase-1 transcription, an ability
which is required for ifn-c-induced activation of cas-
pase-1 transcription [47]. loss of caspase-1 expression in
gastric carcinoma cell lines correlates inversely with p53
expression [48]. as no has been linked to inﬂammation
[49], our data suggest that no may operate in the inﬂam-
matory process by decreasing caspase-1 expression through
a modulation of p73 signaling pathways, and possibly p53
pathways as well.
in mediating
interestingly,
cardiomyocyte
caspase-1 is also a mediator of apoptosis, especially in
some forms of cardiac and neuronal cell death [50].
brain injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion,
a mouse model of stroke, is signiﬁcantly reduced in cas-
pase-1-deﬁcient mice [51]. in the heart, caspase-1 is oper-
cell death and
ative
impairment in contractile function in myocardial
ische-
mia [52].
caspase-1 overexpression in
human ovarian cancer cells induces apoptosis [53]. the
eﬀect of no on caspase-1 gene expression may act in
concert with the recognized ability of no to inhibit cas-
pase-1 activation [16]. thus, no-induced enhancement of
survival maybe operative through reduction in caspase-1
expression.

caspase-6 is an eﬀector caspase and can be activated by
initiator caspases, but it can also be activated by caspase-3
[54]. the expression of caspase-6 correlates with apoptosis
in certain malignancies [55]. in the streptozotocin-induced
diabetic rat, the heart shows an increased activity of cas-
pase-6, but not caspase-3 and -7, in association with an
increase in apoptosis [56]. in transient global brain ische-
mic injury, there is a time-dependent activation of cas-
pase-6 in both neurons and glia in ischemia-sensitive
regions of the brain [45] and active caspase-6 is strongly
implicated in human neuronal degeneration and apoptosis
[57].
the relationship of caspase-6 expression and cell surviv-
al has been infrequently investigated. in colon cancer cell
lines, reduction of caspase-6 expression by small interfering
rna inhibits apoptosis induced by lamin a cleavage [58].
proteolysis of lamin a is involved in the caspase-mediated
nuclear disruption characteristic of apoptosis [59]. our
results, which show a down-regulation of caspase-6 follow-
ing no treatment, suggest that no may function through
a lamin a-independent apoptotic pathway. an intriguing
potential mechanism involves p53, as p53 exerts transcrip-
tional control over caspase-6 through a binding site within
the third intron, leading to transactivation of the caspase
gene [60]. a decrease in p53 binding activity to this site fol-
lowing no treatment could lead to direct reduction in cas-
pase-6 expression which may be caused by a secondary
factor displacing p53 from the dna rather than a direct
modulation of p53 itself. caspase-6 expression and activa-
tion has been linked to transcription factor ap-2a [55]. ap-
2a binds to the bcl-2 promoter and cause its transcriptional
repression, leading to apoptosis via the cytochrome c-de-
pendent intrinsic mitochondrial pathway [61]. our data
suggest that no-induced decrease in caspase-6 expression
may allow for heightened levels of ap-2a transcription,
leading to repression of bcl-2 and apoptosis.
several
limitations of this study should be borne in
mind. first, gene expression was examined only in cardio-
myocytes. however, no has considerable importance in
the heart as no exerts a direct eﬀect on regulation of con-
tractility, modulation of oxygen consumption, substrate
utilization, hypertrophy, sensitivity to apoptosis, and myo-
cyte repair [62]. furthermore, no may play a particularly
important role in myocardial reperfusion injury [38]. sec-
ond, we used microarrays and mrna expression proﬁling,
which have some inherent uncertainty. because such small
amounts of rna are required to perform an experiment,
minor discrepancies in speciﬁcity or binding between exper-
iments can lead to seemingly large fold changes when com-
paring treatments to standards. we attempted to minimize
these problems by examining diﬀerent time points during
no treatment. additionally, identifying changes in ﬂuoro-
phore intensity amidst signiﬁcant background noise inten-
sity may lead to false-positive
[63]. probe
speciﬁcity may also be a factor, especially where two genes
share signiﬁcant sequence homology [64]. similarly, if a
number of isoforms are present on the microarray, a conﬁ-
reports
dent assessment of which is diﬀerentially expressed in a
given experiment may be diﬃcult to make [64]. further ver-
iﬁcation of the results through secondary procedures (for
example northern blots) would strengthen the data
obtained by the arrays. despite these technical shortcom-
ings of the method, the results obtained provide a good
appraisal of the genetic response being examined. these
results, of course, are limited to the genetic response. dif-
ferences in transcript expression patterns need to be cor-
roborated with studies examining protein expression
levels, activity (where appropriate) and functional diﬀer-
ences. however, changes in response to a factor such as
no can be due to a direct action of no on caspase activa-
tion so that gene expression studies are indispensable in
understanding the overall eﬀect of no on caspases. the
ability of no to induce transcriptional regulation is recog-
nized [65], so that its occurrence in cardiomyocytes is not
unexpected. further research into the concepts presented
herein will require measurement of the interested genes
by rt-pcr in cells following in situ stimulation by other
no donors and additional examination of the interactions
between gene and protein expression, and how they relate
to functional action. one can ask the question whether
the eﬀects of sin-1 are speciﬁc to this no donor and
whether other no donors would produce the same
response. to the extent that the responses are dependant
on sin-1, this would suggest that they are more closely
linked with conditions such as acute myocardial infarction
which is associated with increased cardiac peroxynitrite
generation [21,66]. nevertheless it is likely that our data
can be extrapolated to other no donors, as the no donor
noc-18 also increased caspase-8 gene expression [22].
these data suggest that the eﬀect is mediated by no and
its metabolites and is not restricted to an action of sin-1
per se. another concern is that we did not measure the
amount of cell death at 500 lm sin-1, the concentration
that was used to evaluate gene expression. however, at
1000 lm, there is widespread damage to the cells, and
the observed changes in rna would not be solely due to
direct eﬀects of no on gene expression; at 100 lm, no cell
death was detectable. therefore a midpoint was selected.
the data suggest a dose response relationship between
sin-1 and cell death and the concentration dependent cell
death with other no donors is well recognized in cardio-
myocytes [4]. thus it is highly unlikely that 500lm sin-1
would produce anything else other than a mid level of cell
death. lastly it is diﬃcult to be certain how the concentra-
tion of no and its metabolites (such as peroxynitrite) at
the cellular level in the current study compare to the most
clinical conditions. however the concentration of sin-1
used in our study generated nitrite concentration levels that
were within two fold of plasma levels seen in mice one
month after acute coronary artery ligation [19], and no
levels immediately after acute myocardial infarction should
be even higher than at the one month time point [66].
in summary, these results suggest that no regulates
the expression of genes involved in apoptotic but not
346

autophagic cell death. in addition, several caspases that
have not previously been linked to the heart, such as cas-
pase-6 and -14, may have an important role in the heart.
importantly, our results suggest that the transcriptional
activation of caspases can be divided into three groups,
and that no-induced alteration of diﬀerent caspases may
explain the ability of no to either enhance or protect
against cell death depending on whether associated factors
involve, respectively caspases-8, -11, and -14 or -1 and -6.
