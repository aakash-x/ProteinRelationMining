abstract
the process of ageing denotes a post-maturational deterioration of cells and organisms
with the passage of time, an increased vulnerability to challenges and prevalence of age-asso-
ciated diseases, and a decreased ability to survive. causes may be found in an enhanced pro-
duction of reactive oxygen species (ros) and oxidative damage and not completed
housekeeping, with an accumulation of altered ros-hypergenerating organelles in older cells.
it has been shown that autophagy is the only tier of defence against the accumulation of eﬀete
mitochondria and peroxisomes; that functioning of autophagy declines with increasing age
and determinates cell and individual lifespan; that autophagy can be intensiﬁed by drugs;
and that the pharmacological intensiﬁcation of autophagy may be a big step towards retarda-
tion of ageing and prevention and therapy of age-associated diseases
including
neurodegeneration.

1. introduction and overview
process of ageing denotes a post-maturational deterioration of cells and organ-
isms with the passage of time, that underlies an increased vulnerability to challenges
and a decreased ability to survive (masoro, 1999). the issue wether biological ageing
is distinct from age-associated diseases is still a matter of debate (holliday, 2004;
hayﬂick, 2004). the author’s opinion is that recent advancements in biogerontology
may support the hypothesis that all existing living beings are aﬀected by ageing, a
fatal inherited disease (‘‘senectus ipsa morbus est’’) whose incubation period is long
enough to enable patients to reproduce successfully. in this comprehensive view, age-
ing is a disease, not a risk factor for disability and illness, and age-associated diseases
like atherosclerosis, tumours and neurodegeneration should rather be seen like signs
or complications of the underlying fundamental disease, and may share its mecha-
nism(s) at least in part.
there is a general consensus on the fundamental mechanisms of ageing: cell mol-
ecules and substructures are subject to a variety of destructive forces that originate in
both the internal and external environments of an organism, and lesions may accu-
mulate in cells and tissues. at the molecular level, causes may be found in oxidative
damage and not completed housekeeping. both factors are responsible for the pro-
gressive senescence-associated accumulation of deleterious alterations of macromol-
ecules and organelles, responsible for cell misfunctioning, starting from young–adult
age (weindruch and sohal, 1997).
in regard to oxidative damage, the hypothesis is that as much as 1–2% of the used
oxygen molecules might generate reactive oxygen species (ros), endogenously pro-
duced by mitochondria and peroxisomes, which may hit and alter dna, protein, cell
membranes and organelles as well as extracellular components (weindruch and
sohal, 1997). at an older age, accumulation of altered mitochondria and peroxi-
somes may boost the yield of ros per unit of produced energy (see bergamini
et al., 2004). the eﬀects of ros are not counteracted fully by the antioxidant
defenses in the hydrophylic and in the lipophylic compartments of the cell. level
of oxidative stress cannot be modulated at will by the use of antioxidants because
signal is used to monitor the rate of cell metabolism, in order to adjust cell functions
and blood supply. thus, a long-term administration of excess antioxidants may have
severe unwanted eﬀects (yu et al., 1998).
failure in housekeeping (inadequate ability to repair or degrade altered macro-
molecules, cell membranes and organelles and replace them with new) appears to

be the concause of ageing, and the stimulation of turnover of altered proteins,
membranes and organelles (e.g., by caloric restriction (yu, 1995) and physical exer-
cise (holloszy and kohrt, 1995) or drugs (bergamini et al., 2003; berger et al., 2006))
may be a remedy and a part in the mechanism of antiageing interventions. table 1
shows mechanisms responsible for cell maintenance. in summary, repair at the
molecular level can treat any type of dna, protein and lipid damage; autophagy
and lysosomal degradation regulate the turnover rate of macromolecules and subcel-
lular structures, and also help maintenance of cell in case of failure of molecules
repair; in mammals, targeting to lysosomal degradation provides an additional deg-
radative pattern of altered proteins and aggregates, possibly endowed with anti-age-
ing eﬀects, whose function may decline with ageing (kaushik and cuervo, 2006);
macroautophagy may also recognize and dispose altered organelles quite selectively
(donati et al., 2006); failure of repair at the molecular and subcellular level may trig-
ger apoptosis (boya et al., 2005), the last tier of defence against the accumulation of
irreversibly altered cells in the body. all cells in the body must die, including cardiac
and muscle cells and neurons; time-lag before cell death may be inﬂuenced by several
factors and eventually might be determinated by the time of autophagy failure
(table 2). enhanced apoptosis may precipitate cardiac, muscle and neurodegenera-
tive age-associated diseases.
in this issue, attention will be focused on macroautophagy, the physiological
mechanism that controls cell nutrition and volume and adapts cell composition to
a changing environment (stevens and lowe, 2000); mechanism also protects cells
from the age-related accumulation of altered proteins, membranes and organelles
(stevens and lowe, 2000; see also terman et al., 2006). macroautophagy was said
to be the putative mechanism of the anti-ageing action of caloric restriction (berga-
mini and gori, 1995; see also donati, 2006). macroautophagy is a highly conserved
degradation/recycling system ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, in which the cytoplasm,
including excess or aberrant organelles, is sequestered into double-membrane vesicles
and delivered to the degradative organelle, the lysosome/vacuole, for breakdown and

notes: many ad researchers embraced the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, which states that beta-amyloid
(ab) is the trigger for all cases of ad and that the tau pathology and other degenerative changes are a
downstream consequence of the ab pathology (hardy and selkoe, 2002). based on this hypothesis,
many diﬀerent factors may aﬀect time of neurodegeneration and development of clinical symptoms.
membrane alteration (e.g., an alteration in the antioxidant machinery of membranes – see bergamini
et al., 2004) or mutation of app gene may increase the frequency of post-translational modiﬁcation of
app at some site and increase yield of ab1–42 by app cleavage and accelerate neuropathology.
(dolichol and ubiquinone are part in the antioxidant machinery and involvement might perhaps
account for the beneﬁcial eﬀects of statins). emerging evidence indicates that intraneuronal ab also
plays an early pathophysiological role in ad (billings et al., 2005), and serves as a source for some of
the extracellular amyloid deposits (oddo et al., 2006). the secreted ab may be rapidly degraded or not
by matrix mmp-2 and mmp-3 (white et al., 2006). neocortical ab binds cu2+ with very high
aﬃnity, forming a redox-active complex that catalyzes h2o2 production from o2 (puglielli et al.,
2005). the generation of the ab toxic species is modulated by the cu2+ concentration and the ability
to form an intermolecular his bridge, and toxicity correlates with lipid peroxidation and dityrosine
formation.(smith et al., 2006). inﬂammation is a critical component of the pathogenesis of ad.
although not an initiator of this disorder, inﬂammation nonetheless plays a pivotal role as a driving
force that can modulate the neuropathology (kitazawa et al., 2005). accumulation and aggregation of
ab peptide in the brain may activate glial cells which, in turn, initiate neuroinﬂammatory responses
that involve reactive oxygen intermediates and release of inﬂammatory cytokines (cheng et al.,
in
press). sustained brain inﬂammation might have deleterious eﬀect through the activation of microglia,
secretion of many pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and generation of oxidative products and can be an
essential cofactor in ad and other neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson disease, dementia
with lewy bodies, huntington’s and prion diseases. (bonifati and kishore, in press). the quality-
control machinery in neuron might play an important role in retarding the pathogenesis of tauopathy
and neuron death. for instance, an increase in heat-shock cognate (hsc)70-interacting protein may
protect against nft formation in the early stages of ad (sahara et al., 2005); several studies
implicate the proteasome as a major factor in the clearance of early tau lesions (oddo et al., 2004);
stimulation of macroautophagy may help to clear accumulated aggresomes and retard apoptosis
(ravikumar and rubinsztein, 2006).

eventual recycling (wang and klionsky, 2003). process generates nutrients during
fasting under the control of amino acids and pancreatic hormones (kanazawa
et al., 2004; miotto and kadowaki, this issue) and gives place to resynthesis, turn-
over and rejuvenation of cellular components (long-lived proteins, cytomembranes
and organelles) (bergamini et al., 2004; see also donati, 2006). this process has
an important role in various biological events such as adaptation to changing envi-
ronmental conditions and cellular remodeling during development and diﬀerentia-
tion (yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005). autophagic degradation has an important
role in physiology of the nervous system, heart and muscle (eskelinen, 2006).
autophagy also samples proteins in cell (viral, tumour and autoantigens) and gener-
ates peptides which are then presented on major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
class ii (munz, 2006; schmid et al., 2006). thus autophagy represents a previously
unrecognized immune mechanism that may act against cells with intracellular
microbes (deretic, 2005) and perhaps against cells (e.g., cancer cells) exhibiting
abnormal protein synthesis and composition.
it has been known for decades that autophagy regulates mitochondria (pfeifer,
1978) and peroxisome turnover (veenhuis et al., 1983; locci cubeddu et al., 1985;
for recent advancements, see monastyrska and klionsky, 2006). very recent evi-
dence shows that macroautophagy recognizes and eliminates older or altered
ros-hypergenerating organelles quite selectively (gu et al., 2004; donati et al.,
2006). the molecular identity of the ‘‘opsonizing’’ mechanism is not known yet
(klionsky, 2005) but perhaps arf might be in the game (reef et al., 2006). the
accumulation of altered protein (yamamoto et al., 2006) and any type of cell injury,
including ros (moore, 2004),
in press) and
mechanic (diskin et al., 2005) injuries can ignite a nutrition-independent m-tor-
independent macroautophagy (see meijer and codogno, 2006). these two types
(nutrition- and injury-dependent) of activation might interact each-other to potenti-
ate protection.
ischemic (hamacher-brady et al.,
signalling and autophagy regulation have been investigated and clariﬁed (meijer
and codogno, 2006) and may undergo progressive deterioration with increasing age,
both in vitro (cavallini et al., 2001) and in vivo (del roso et al., 2003). the age-
related decline in functioning of autophagy might account for the age-dependency
of many age-associated diseases in ad libitum-fed animals, including neurodegener-
ation (boland and nixon, 2006), and for retardation by caloric restriction (donati,
2006) and by the pharmacological intensiﬁcation of autophagic degradation (donati
et al., 2004; ravikumar and rubinsztein, 2006).
2. conclusions
there may be support to the hypothesis that during evolution, in order to pro-
mote rapid growth and successful reproduction, nature tuned down autophagic deg-
radation too much and function of cell maintenance suﬀered and determinated
lifespan. a dramatically increasing number of scientiﬁc contributions is being pub-
lished showing that autophagy is primarily a pro-survival mechanism (levine and
408
e. bergamini / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 403–410
yuan, 2005). currently available data show that the pharmacological intensiﬁcation
of the process of autophagic degradation may be a big step towards retardation of
ageing and prevention and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.
