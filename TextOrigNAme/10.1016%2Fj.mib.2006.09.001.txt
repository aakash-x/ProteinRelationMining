non-self recognition and programmed cell
death in filamentous fungi
n louise glass and karine dementhon
non-self recognition resulting in programmed cell death is a
ubiquitous phenomenon in filamentous ascomycete fungi and is
termed heterokaryon incompatibility (hi). recent analyses show
that genes containing predicted het domains are often involved
in hi; however, the function of the het domain is unknown.
autophagy is induced as a consequence of hi, whereas the
presence of a predicted transcription factor, vib-1, is required for
hi. morphological features associated with apoptosis in
filamentous fungi are induced by various stresses and drugs, and
also during hi. future analyses will reveal whether common or
different genetic mechanisms trigger death by non-self
recognition and death by various environmental onslaughts.

hi is genetically regulated in filamentous ascomycete
species by het loci (named after heterokaryon) [2,4,5]. the
observed acquisition of novel het genes through interspecies gene transfer in ophiostoma novo-ulmi indicated that
new het specificities can undergo fixation within a population [6]. dna polymorphisms associated with het allele
specificity can be under selection for diversity, a feature
common to genes under balancing selection [7,8,9], an
observation that is consistent with their role in mediating
non-self recognition. hi also prevents transmission of
mycoviruses by hyphal fusion [10]. these observations
support the hypothesis that non-self recognition confers a
selective advantage and that genetic mechanisms favor het
gene divergence and subsequent fixation in populations
of filamentous ascomycete fungi.
the genetics of recognition
the importance of identity
two types of genetic system, termed ‘allelic’ and ‘nonallelic’, regulate hi in filamentous ascomycete fungi
[2,4,5]. in allelic hi, non-self recognition is triggered
by alleles of different specificity at the same locus, for
example at het-s in p. anserina (figure 2) [4]. the het-s
locus is unusual in that allelic specificity is not stable
because the het-s can fold into two different conformations; one which doesn’t trigger hi and one, an infectious
prion form, [het-s], which does [11]. the [het-s]
prion also functions as a meiotic drive element in crosses
between het-s and het-s strains [12,13]. recent structural
studies indicate that the prion-forming domain of [hets] is essential for conferring non-self recognition and hi
[14]; the corresponding region in the non-prion form,
het-s, is also required for hi [15].
the ability to distinguish oneself from another is a
ubiquitous phenomenon among all living things. as a
filamentous fungal colony grows across a substrate in
nature, it will encounter many other microorganisms,
including bacteria, fungal colonies of the same or of
different species, protist species and insects. interactions
between different fungal species, such as podospora anserina and coprinopsis cinerea, can result in the generation of
hydrogen peroxide and death of hyphae [1]. non-self
recognition between genetically different isolates of the
same fungal species often results in compartmentalization
and death of hyphae that undergo fusion between the two
strains, a phenomenon termed ‘heterokaryon incompatibility’ (hi; figure 1) [2]. macroscopically, this interaction often results in a ‘barrage’, or demarcation zone
between incompatible fungal colonies. although the formation of a barrage is often used to infer genetically
different individuals, an association between hi and
barrage-formation is not always observed [3].
an example of non-allelic incompatibility between
closely linked genes is the het-c/pin-c haplotype in neurospora crassa, whereas non-allelic interactions among the
unlinked loci, het-r and het-v, mediate hi in p. anserina
(figure 2) [16,17]. interestingly, five of the six molecularly characterized het interactions involve predicted
proteins that share a common 150 amino acid domain,
termed the het domain (pfam06985; n. crassa het-6, tol
and pin-c and p. anserina het-d and het-e). outside of the
het domain, these genes are dissimilar in sequence and
domain structure (figure 3). het domain genes often
interact with another gene (non-allelic hi interactions).
for example, in n. crassa, het-c/pin-c hi requires a plasma
membrane protein (het-c) and a het domain protein
(pin-c; figure 3) [16]. a non-self recognition complex
between un-24 (encoding ribonucleotide reductase) and
het-6 (a het domain gene) loci is associated with an
inversion [7]; specific alleles at un-24 and het-6 are in

severe linkage disequilibrium. hi that is associated with
the het-6 haplotype requires genetic differences at both
un-24 and het-6. in p. anserina, non-self recognition
mediated by pahet-c/het-d or pahet-c/het-e requires a
glycolipid transfer protein (pahet-c) [18] and a het
domain protein (het-e or het-d) [19]. interestingly,
in the plant species arabidopsis thaliana, an ortholog of
pahet-c, acd11, has been implicated in programmed cell
death (pcd) [20].
predicted het domain genes are specific to and common
in filamentous ascomycete genomes. the n. crassa genome
contains 50 het domain genes, the human pathogen
aspergillus fumigatus has seven, whereas the plant pathogen
stagonospora nodorum has 150. genetic analysis and
modeling analysis indicate that the number of het loci
required for non-self recognition in fungal populations is
between 7 and 12 [2,21], suggesting that not all predicted
het domain genes are involved in hi. phylogenetic
analysis of het domain genes in the genomes of different
aspergillus species (the numbers of genes range between 7–
38) indicate multiple gene duplication events, rapid diversification and gene loss [22]. het domain genes
involved in hi are highly polymorphic within fungal
populations. for example, alleles of different specificity
at n. crassa pin-c or het-6 show only 47–68% identity at the
amino acid level (depending on the allele comparison)
[7,16]. in p. anserina het-e and het-d, sequence variation
is associated with allelic specificity [19]. although polymorphisms associated with specificity have been identified

interactions between predicted het domain proteins ( pin-c, tol, het-6, het-e and het-d) and their partners (het-c, mat, un-24 and pahet-c).
interactions between un-24 and het-6 are inferred on the basis of population analyses and a decrease in fitness in meiotic progeny; specific alleles
at het-6 and un-24 show severe linkage disequilibrium [7,9].
in the non-allelic or gene complex partners of het domain
genes (such as n. crassa het-c, un-24 and pahet-c; [2]), these
genes do not show similar levels of duplication, divergence
and loss among filamentous ascomycete species [22].
little is understood about how molecular interactions
between alternate het genes mediate non-self recognition
and trigger hi. loss-of-function mutations at het-c, pin-c,
tol, mat, pahet-c, het-e and het-s do not affect the vegetative
growth phenotype of mutants. however, such mutants
fail to distinguish self from non-self and will form vigorous heterokaryons with strains with which they were
formerly incompatible. thus, incompatibility cannot be
a result of disruption of an essential cellular function
encoded by het genes. models depict physical interaction
between proteins encoded by het loci as a pre-requisite for
non-self recognition. in support of this hypothesis, a
het-c heterocomplex composed of alternative hetc proteins is associated with hi in n. crassa, suggesting
that a het-c/pin-c heterocomplex might play a role in
non-self recognition [16,23].
signaling death
compartmentalization by septal plugging, increased
septation, vacuolization of plugged compartments and
accumulation of lipid bodies are common microscopic
features associated with hi. two new approaches to
identify components of the death pathway have been
used recently: the characterization of genes induced
during hi [24–26]; and the identification of mutations
which suppress hi [16,27].
www.sciencedirect.com
the p. anserina het-r/het-v system shows temperature
sensitivity; strains containing incompatible het-r and
het-v alleles grow like the wild type at 32 8c, but undergo
massive cell death when shifted to 26 8c [24]. genes
induced during het-r/het-v incompatibility (idi family)
include genes for predicted cell wall proteins (idi-1, idi2 and idi-3), a predicted bzip transcription factor (idi-4)
and orthologs of autophagy genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae (idi-6 and idi-7) [17,26,28]. during autophagy, organelles and cytoplasm are engulfed in specialized vesicles
termed autophagosomes and targeted to the vacuole for
degradation and recycling. the idi genes are induced
under nitrogen starvation and treatment with rapamycin,
a specific inhibitor of the tor (for ‘target of rapamycin’)
kinase; treatment of the cells with rapamycin mimicked
the effects of hi [24]. autophagy, first described as a
cellular response to nutrient starvation, has been associated with pcd in metazoans [29]. however, p. anserina
mutants in the s. cerevisiae orthologs of atg1, a protein
kinase involved in the induction of autophagy and atg8,
a gene required for autophagosome formation, showed
accelerated cell death associated with hi [28]. although
the bzip dna-binding domain of idi-4 binds to the idi-7
promoter, inactivation of idi-4 does not affect hi [25,30].
these observations indicate that the induction of autophagy during hi is a cell survival response in conflict with
death signaling pathways.
in n. crassa, mutations in a putative transcription factor
gene, vib-1, (for vegetative incompatibility blocked) suppress both mat and het-c/pin-c incompatibility [27,31,32].
current opinion in microbiology 2006, 9:553–558
556 growth and development
the mat locus encodes transcription factors required for
entry into sexual reproduction; fusion between opposite
mating types during vegetative growth results in hi
(figure 3). recent results suggest that vib-1 is required
for the expression of het domain genes, pin-c, tol and het6 [33]. recently, a strain containing mutations in an
ortholog of vib-1 in aspergillus nidulans was shown to be
defective in protease production in response to nutrient
limitation [34]. these data suggest that mutations in vib-1
might suppress hi both because het domain genes are
not expressed and because downstream effectors of hi
might be lacking.
more than one way to die?
pcd mechanisms are ubiquitous in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic species. filamentous fungal genomes contain
the complement of genes involved in pcd in s. cerevisiae,
and also have homologs of genes, involved in pcd in
metazoans, that are not present in s. cerevisiae or saccharomyces pombe [2,22,35,36]. several biochemical assays
have been used to assess cellular changes associated with
apoptosis in filamentous fungi, including deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling
(tunel) for dna degradation, annexin-fitc (fluorescein) binding for the presence of phosphatidylserine on
the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and 2,70 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for reactive oxygen species
(ros) production. in addition, the exclusion of propidium iodide and the blockage of cell death by treatment
with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide are used to
differentiate apoptosis from necrosis. the results of these
assays show that apoptosis in filamentous fungi occurs in
response to treatment with hydrogen peroxide, phytosphingosine, antifungal proteins (pafs), amphotericin b
and farnesol [37,38–40,41]. farnesol is involved in
quorum sensing in candida albicans [42], but causes
apoptosis in a. nidulans, implying that this signaling
molecule might be used in interspecies antagonistic
interactions [37]. apoptotic characters such as dna
degradation are also associated with hi in n. crassa
[43], entry into stationary phase in a. fumigatus [44] and
asexual sporulation in a. nidulans [45].
in c. albicans, mutations that block ras signaling —
including those in ras1, cdc35 (encoding adenylate
cyclase), tpk1 and tpk2, which encode regulatory subunits of pka — suppress or delay the apoptotic
response upon exposure to low levels of acetic acid,
h202 and amphotericin b [46,47]. by contrast, mutations that result in constitutive activation of the ras
pathway, such as ras1val13 (daras), accelerate entry
into the apoptotic pathway in c. albicans and colletotrichum trifolii [41,47], although ras activation by itself
is not sufficient to kill cells. treatment of c. trifolii with
proline suppressed apoptosis associated with daras as
well as apoptosis associated with a variety of stresses
[41]. in a. nidulans, resistance to pafs and farnesol was
current opinion in microbiology 2006, 9:553–558
associated with a dominant-interfering mutations in the
a–subunit of g protein, fadag203r [39] or mutations in
the gb subunit (dsfad), respectively [37], whereas
mutations that hyperactivated g protein signaling
(dflba) resulted in increased sensitivity to farnesol. a
predicted poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) ortholog in a. nidulans was also shown to be required for
farnesol-induced nuclear condensation [48]. parp is a
highly conserved enzyme that is implicated in the stress
response and in apoptosis in metazoans [49]. crosstalk
between camp and g protein signaling occurs in several fungi [50], although the exact mechanisms vary
among fungal species. these observations suggest that
alterations of nutrient signaling pathways might mediate the commitment of hyphae to enter the apoptotic
and hi pathways.
conclusion: life after death?
the process of pcd in filamentous ascomycete fungi
occurs as a result of non-self recognition, treatment with
various drugs and during developmental processes. work
in p. anserina and n. crassa suggest that protein interaction
and conformation alterations might be a molecular
mechanism for non-self recognition. genetic analyses
of hi and of apoptosis induction by drug treatment
suggest that signaling pathways involved in nutrient
sensing might be recruited to trigger death. analyses in
p. anserina indicate that the induction of cell survival
mechanisms, such as autophagy, also occur in concert
with death signaling, thus complicating analysis of signal
transduction mechanisms associated with death. future
work will determine the commonalities and differences in
pcd or apoptosis induced by hi between a variety of
environmental triggers. specifically, do all of these triggers mediate death by a common signaling and dismantling pathway, or are there many ways to die, depending
on which cellular pathway is perturbed?

accelerates programmed cell death in the pathogenic fungus
candida albicans. proc natl acad sci usa 2006, 103:726-731.
environmental stresses induce pcd and necrosis in c. albicans. this
study showed that progression from an apoptotic state to necrosis is
modulated by rasâ€“campâ€“protein kinase a signals. ras activation might
induce pcd in c. albicans, either by inhibiting anti-apoptotic functions
(stress response) or by activating pro-apoptotic functions.
