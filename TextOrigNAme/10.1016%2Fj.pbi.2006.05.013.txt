systemic immunity
murray grant1 and chris lamb2
systemic acquired resistance (sar) provides enhanced, longlasting systemic immunity to secondary infection by a range of
biotrophic, hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens that
have diverse modes of infection. considerable effort has
focussed on the conserved central positive regulator of sar,
non-expressor of pathogenesis-related1 (npr1),
and its control by changes in cellular redox potential. recently,
genetic and genomic approaches have highlighted a critical
role for nucleocytoplasmic communication and protein
secretion in establishing effective systemic immunity.
identification of the mobile signals and the mechanisms by
which they are perceived in distal tissues remains challenging,
but emerging evidence suggests that signal translocation uses
lipid-derived (possibly jasmonate-based) signals and lipidbinding chaperones. furthermore, the demonstration that
autophagy interdicts and inactivates a systemic cell death
signal adds further complexity to elucidating how mobile
signals are decoded and transduced for effective immunity.

here, we focus on sar but consider signal convergence
and cross-talk with isr.
the sar signalling networks appear to share significant
overlap with those induced by basal defences against
microbial-associated molecular patterns (mamps). consequently, various arabidopsis defence mutants have been
beneficial in addressing the establishment of sar in
responding leaves. induced basal resistance involves the
recognition of mamps by pattern recognition receptors,
whereas sar-responding leaves must decode one or more
unknown mobile signals. the identification of these signals
and their cognate receptors represents a significant challenge. an outstanding question is whether the activation of
systemic immunity is triggered by the removal of repressors
of the sar response network, as hypothesised for basal
defence following bacterial flagellin recognition [7].

introduction
the term √¢‚Ç¨Àúcross protection√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ was initially used to describe
enhanced tolerance to disease in previously infected
perennials [1], a classical example being the demonstration that orchid embryos that were unsuccessfully
infected by fungi were more resistant to a highly virulent
fungus (n bernard [1909] cited in [2]). today, cross
protection comes in two guises, systemic acquired resistance (sar) and induced systemic resistance (isr).
sar requires both local and systemic salicylic acid (sa)
accumulation and the induction of a subset of the pathogenesis-related (pr) genes, but sa itself is not the mobile
signal [3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú5]. by contrast, isr is associated with the ability
of rhizobacterial strains that promote plant growth to

non-expressor
of
pathogenesisrelated1 (npr1, also known as non-immunity
1 [nim1]) is a central positive regulator of sar signalling
[8,9]. npr1 protein contains an ankyrin repeat and a btb/
poz domain [10], and functions downstream of sa. accumulation of sa induces a change in cellular redox potential
triggering the reduction of npr1 from cytosolic, disulphide-bound oligomers to active monomers that translocate to the nucleus and interact with tga transcription
factors [11,12]. these interactions stimulate the binding of
tga factors to sa-responsive elements in the promoters
of pr genes, and the subsequent transcriptional reprogramming contributes to the establishment of sar. as
overexpression in rice of npr1 (or the rice orthologue
nh1) confers enhanced resistance to the pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, npr1 function appears to be
conserved between monocots and dicots [13].
npr1-interacting partners
npr1 interacts with three structurally related nuclear
localised nim1-interacting (nimin) proteins
[14]. nimin1 interacts with npr1 in vivo, and in yeast,
nimin1 complexes together with tga and npr1 to a
pr-1 promoter element [15]. overexpression of
nimin1 suppresses resistance to an avirulent pseudomonas syringae (pst) strain and attenuates sar and pr1
expression. nimin1 knock down enhanced pr1 expression but did not modify pathogen responses. remarkably,

in rice, ectopic expression of an unrelated rice nuclearlocalized protein, negative regulator of
resistance (nrr), which interacts with both nh1
[13] and npr1, generates pathogen responses that are
similar to those resulting from the overexpression of
nimin1 [16]. nimin1 and nrr share only a conserved npr1-binding domain. collectively, these data
suggest that nrr and nimin1 have conserved functions
as transcriptional repressors that negatively regulate a
subset of the npr1 signalling network [16].
genetic interactions with npr1
the importance of nuclear components in npr1 signalling has recently emerged through genetic suppressor
screens. suppressor of npr1-1, inducible 1
(sni1) encodes a leucine-rich nuclear protein and is
probably a negative regulator of sar [14]. recently, three
mos alleles (for modifiers of suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive
1 [scn1]), which encode mutations of a constitutively
active r protein that suppresses npr1 [17]), were characterized. mos2, which controls the sa-independent
pathway that is activated in snc1 npr1 plants, encodes a
nuclear rna-binding protein that is critical for basal and
some r-gene-mediated resistance [18]. mos3 is similar
to human nup96, a nucleoporin that is important for
mrna export and is required for the constitutive prgene expression and disease resistance in snc1 plants
[19]. mos6 encodes importin a3 [20]. collectively,
the mos mutants highlight a role for the regulation of
nuclear rna processing and nuclear cytoplasmic trafficking during npr1 signalling. as human nup96 interacts
with sec13 [21], these data suggest a link between the
nuclear pore complex, the endoplasmic reticulum (er)
and protein secretion.
transcriptional regulation by npr1
dong and colleagues arrived at a similar conclusion by
comparing the gene expression profiles of an npr1 mutant
and a dexamethasone (dex)-inducible npr1 line under
conditions designed to identify primary targets of nuclearlocalized npr1 transcriptional regulation [22]. transcripts that are associated with protein secretion were
over-represented following dex induction of npr1, consistent with the anticipated accumulation of pr proteins
in the vacuoles and apoplast during sar. these data
suggest that npr1 co-ordinates upregulation of the secretory apparatus to ensure proper folding and localization of
pr proteins. biochemical and genetic approaches confirmed that induced transcripts encoding the er-resident
chaperone bip2, the co-chaperone defender
against apoptotic death 1 (dad1) and
sec61 (which is involved in protein transfer across the
er membrane) all compromised sar.
to integrate and fine-tune systemic responses depending
upon the nature of the immunizing pathogen. npr1dependent isr signalling does not require redox-activated npr1 nuclear localization [23], consistent with a
role for ja:indoleacetic acid (iaa) as an inducing signal
[24]. other possible targets are wrky transcription factors that bind w boxes in pr genes, such as the positive
regulator of sa signalling wrky70 [25]. alternatively,
the targets might be interactions with negative regulators
of sa signalling, such as mitogen-activated protein (map)
kinase 4 (mapk4), which negatively regulates sa and
positively regulates ja defence responses [26]. the identification of mks1, a mapk4 substrate, established a
biochemical link between wrky transcription factors
and sa [27]. mks1 functions downstream of sa and
independently of ja signalling pathways to confer sadependent resistance. in an interaction walk, mks1
interacted with wrky25 and wrky33, thereby coupling
mapk4 to activation of sar [28].
npr1-independent, sa-dependent signalling
not all sar-mediated responses are npr1 dependent.
the arabidopsis whirly transcription factor (atwhy1)
functions as an sa-dependent, npr1-independent regulator of sar. atwhy1 binds to pb boxes, which are
over-represented in transcripts that are associated with
sar-inducing challenges [28,29]. bizarrely, atwhy1 and
atwhy2 localise to the chloroplast and mitochondria [30].
further studies will be necessary to understand the role of
this cross talk in sar.
sa and sar
although sa can be synthesised from phenylalanine, the
predominant pathway for de novo sa biosynthesis during
pathogen infection is through chorismate via isochorismate synthase (ics) [31]. sar is strongly compromised in
the isochorismate synthase mutant sid2 and transcripts
that are associated with both plastid primary carbon
metabolism and the shikimate pathway (including ics)
are rapidly induced by bacterial inoculation [32]. a
recent breakthrough suggests that an alternative, rapidly
mobilisable source of sa is generated through the activity
of the high-affinity sa-binding protein sabp2. crystal
structure determination showed that sabp2, an integral
component of systemic immunity, belongs to the a/b
hydrolase superfamily [33]. sabp2 converts methyl salicylate (mesa) to sa in vitro, suggesting that sabp2
might generate signal-competent sa from mesa during
sar [34]. interestingly, the identification of a tomato
methyl jasmonate (meja) esterase that has homology to
sabp2 [35] might help to resolve the contribution of ja
and meja to systemic immunity.
lipids as signals in systemic immunity
involvement of npr1 in other signalling pathways
npr1 also modulates cross-talk between sa and ja
signalling, and might function as a molecular rheostat

sar is generally studied as a response to classical genefor-gene recognition. nitric oxide (no), sa, ja, ethylene
and lipid-derived molecules are all implicated in systemic

signalling and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere.
the challenge is to separate their respective contributions to sar signalling against their collaboration in local
programmed cell death. for the purposes of this review,
we concentrate on potential lipid signals. intracellular
signals that are derived from lipid metabolism are emerging as mediators of basal, gene-for-gene and more
recently systemic resistance (for an excellent general
overview on plant lipids see [36]).
exhibits both lipase and antimicrobial activity [46] and
glip1 plants are compromised in local and systemic resistance to the necrotrophic pathogen alternaria brassicicola.
interestingly, glip1 transcription responded to ethylene
but not to sa or ja, suggesting that ethylene and sa
collaborate in generating the effective lipid signal following a. brassicicola infection. the extent of glip1 participation in other systemic signalling processes now needs
to be determined.
a fundamental role for lipid biosynthesis in sar is
reflected by the recessive arabidopsis steroyl-acyl carrier
protein desaturase mutant suppressor of sa-insensitivity 2
(ssi2), an npr1-5 suppressor [37]. ssi2 plants are unable to
convert stearic acid to oleic acid. this oleate deficiency
activates spontaneous cell death and leads to constitutive
sar but enhanced susceptibility to the necrotroph botrytis cinerea [38,39]. by contrast, the ssi2 suppressor suppressor of fatty acid desaturase 1 (sfd1) is compromised in sar,
and many of the ssi2 growth defects are alleviated
[40,41]. sfd1 encodes dihydroxyacetone phosphate
reductase, which forms the glycerol-3-phosphate backbone of glycerolipids. although sfd1 is required for both
local and distant sa accumulation following pathogen
challenge, basal resistance is unaffected in sfd1 mutants,
suggesting that sfd1 functions in the generation, translocation and/or perception of a mobile sar signal. extensive double mutant analysis of ssi2 with various defence
and fatty acid desaturation pathway mutants indicates
that ssi-triggered defence signalling requires components
of both the fatty acid and the sa signalling pathways
[42]. moreover, ssi2 and glycerol-mediated signalling are
associated with reduced 18:1 levels, mechanistically linking the glycerol-kinase-encoding gene nonhost
resistance 1 (nho1) to defence [43]. the impact
of glycerol application on sar has yet to be reported.
historically, systemic signalling interactions between the
oxylipin ja and sa have been considered antagonistic;
however, evidence of positive cross-talk between sa, ja
and ethylene during systemic responses is accumulating.
ja increases in developing tobacco lesions following
inoculation with avirulent bacteria that are compromised
in sid2 or in salicylate hydroxylase (nahg)-overexpressing
arabidopsis and tobacco plants [47,48], whereas ja levels
are elevated in nahg and sid2 arabidopsis following compatible pst challenges. consistent with these observations, fad7/fad8 v√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú3 fatty acid desaturase mutants,
which have reduced chloroplast trieonic fatty acids, are
compromised for both basal and gene-for-gene defence
[42]. coincident with the induction of reactive oxygen
intermediates (rois) by avirulent pst challenge, trieonic
fatty acids (predominately linolenic acid) are liberated
from chloroplasts [49], providing potential substrates for
ja biosynthesis. co-application of ja and sa at low
concentrations is synergistic in causing the expression
of classical markers of ja (i.e. defensin [pdf1.2] and
thionin [thi1.2]) or sa (pr1), whereas higher concentrations are antagonistic and induce apoplastic roi and cell
death [48]. these studies highlight the need to monitor
relative hormone concentrations, and their dynamics and
spatial distribution, when considering signal integration.
enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (eds1),
phytoalexin deficient 4 (pad4) and senescence-associated gene 101 (sag101) are three
defence regulators that have homology to acyl transferases. eds1, pad4 and sag101 directly interact in
various combinations to orchestrate basal immunity and
some gene-for-gene interactions [44,45]. eds1 acts
upstream of the oxidative burst, and is required for sa
synthesis and for the constitutive sar phenotypes of
constitutive expressor of pathogenesis-related genes cpr1 and
cpr6. we and others have hypothesized that eds1 also
contributes to the establishment or maintenance of sar.
sar-induced bacterial growth restriction is abolished in
eds1 and pad4 backgrounds, even when recognition of the
immunizing avr√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúr gene combination is eds1 independent (cited in [45]; m grant, c lamb, unpublished).
lipid signalling in sar is also utilised by necrotrophic
pathogens. accumulation of apoplastic glip1, a lipase
that contains a gdsl motif, is sa dependent. glip1
current opinion in plant biology 2006, 9:414√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú420
comparative global transcription profiling studies on systemic responding tissue identified approximately 400
genes that are specifically induced within 2.5 h of recognition of the rpm1 protein, which activates disease
resistance in response to pst. systemically responding
transcripts encoded components of secondary metabolite
pathways and showed marked similarity to the transcriptional reprogramming of basal defences [33]. strikingly,
70% of the systemically responding transcripts are also
induced following ja application. ja signalling and biosynthetic mutations, including jasmonate insensitive1

translocation of the mobile signal √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù is it ja?
plant lipid transfer proteins (ltps) represent potential
chaperones for lipid-derived systemic signalling molecules. wheat ltp1 can compete for the same homotetrameric binding site on tobacco membranes as sarinducing elicitins [50]. defective in induced resistance1
(dir1) is an extracellular ltp that is involved in the
www.sciencedirect.com
systemic immunity grant and lamb 417
local generation, or subsequent translocation, of a mobile
systemic signal [51]. recently, two lines of evidence have
implicated protein-specific lipophilic ligand interactions
in long-distance signalling complexes [52]. first, recombinant tobacco ltp1 is competent to load fatty acids,
including ja. second, not only is ltp1 capable of binding plasma membrane elicitin receptors, which mediate
plant defence responses [53], but ltp1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúja binds preferentially over either ltp1 or ltp1-linolenic acid. as
application of ltp1-ja, but not of ltp1 or ja alone,
resulted in enhanced resistance in tobacco against phytophthora parasitica, these data support a role for ja as a
systemic signal. the importance of ja as an essential
component of the long-distance signal for wounding is
now well documented [54,55]. considering the localisation of ja-biosynthetic enzymes to the sieve elements
and companion cells in tomato [56], and the extensive
apoplastic exchange, release and retrieval of phloem
constituents along the phloem pathway [57], a mobile
ja signal could iterate itself along the phloem network to
provide a robust, global inductive signal. whether these
interactions occur in vivo, the nature of the specificity of
ltps and lipophilic ligands involved, and the identification of their cognate receptor for a particular inducing
pathogen need to be addressed. likewise, the role of the
apoplastic aspartic protease constitutive disease resistance 1 (cdr1), which is required for
both basal resistance and sar, warrants further attention
[58]. the involvement of a small mobile peptide signal
that is released by cdr1 action reveals a further parallel,
alongside the potential involvement of ja, between
mobile signalling in sar and wound responses.
early signalling events in perception
an eight-year-old report of a rapid systemic induction of
glutathione s-transferase1 (gst1) transcripts following the
inoculation of arabidopsis leaves with avirulent
pst(avrrpt2) but not with virulent pst remains the most
definitive analysis of signal perception in na√§¬±√¨ÀÜve leaves.
gst1 induction preceded localized oxidative bursts (microrois) and the formation of systemic micro-hrs in isolated periveinal cells of systemically responding leaves
[59]. similar systemic microrois were recently reported
in pepper following inoculation with avirulent xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria [60]. the source of the rois
remains unclear. in tomato leaves, systemic h2o2 generation is mediated through the octadecanoid pathway
[61]. one function of microrois might be to activate
atrbohd, thereby negatively regulating sa-dependent
cell death signals and restricting systemic cell death
[62]. cell death in systemic tissues is negatively regulated
by autophagy. virus-induced silencing of nicotiana
benthamiana beclin 1, an orthologue of yeast and mammalian autophagy genes (or indeed other autophagyrelated genes), resulted in unrestricted cell death in local
and systemic tissues, either following tobacco mosaic
virus (tmv) infection or elicitation of hypersensitive cell
www.sciencedirect.com
death by the viral protein p50 [63]. autolysosomes were
observed locally and systemically during the normal nmediated resistance response, suggesting that autolysosomes eliminate a pathogen-induced mobile √¢‚Ç¨Àúprodeath√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢
signal(s). caenorhabditis elegans bec-1 also controls programmed cell death processes through a caspase-dependent mechanism [64], suggesting that this is a highly
conserved process. the signals generated by microroi
domains, or the microroi themselves, might trigger the
systemic cell death in beclin 1-compromised plants.
the identification of the mechanism underlying the
recognition of this √¢‚Ç¨Àúprodeath√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ signal(s) by autolysosomes
represents a major challenge. given the emerging evidence for lipid signalling, the evolutionarily conserved
calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding copine family,
first identified as negative regulators of snc1 [65,66],
might represent signalling components that integrate
lipid signalling and the concomitant suppression of cell
death pathways [67].
conclusions and future prospects
understanding the early events that underpin systemic
immunity, in particular signal generation, translocation
and distal perception, requires detailed time-course analysis of systemic immunity, coupled to global transcript
profiling in systemically responding tissues. although
many defence mutants have defects in sar, they are
immune-compromised and provide limited clues as to
how systemic signals are generated, translocated and
perceived in na√§¬±√¨ÀÜve responding tissues. grafting provides
a powerful method for the unambiguous resolution of the
contribution of the genes that are affected in these
defence mutants to signal generation and translocation,
or to signal perception and the maintenance of systemic
immunity [68]. induced and uninduced phloem exudates
can be analysed by liquid chromatography (lc)/mass
spectrometry (ms)/ms to identify potential mobile signals. in parallel, proton transfer reaction ms (ptr-ms)
will permit highly sensitive, almost simultaneous, online
monitoring of a large number of different volatile organic
compounds that might contribute to maintaining the
immunized state. adopting these emerging technologies
should rapidly facilitate our understanding of this highly
complex but agronomically important and scientifically
interesting phenomenon.

nimin1, one of three structurally related npr1-interacting proteins,
associates with npr1 in the nucleus. tri-hybrid interaction studies
suggest that nimin1 binds the as-1 promoter element as a ternary
complex with npr1 and the transcription factors tga2 or tga6. overexpression of nimin1 suppresses npr1 activity and modulates pr1
expression, leading to enhanced susceptibility to normally avirulent
pathogens and abrogation of sar. collectively, these data suggest that
nimin1 acts as a repressor of npr1. this function might be associated
with a putative erf-associated amphiphilic repression (ear) motif that
was identified in repressors of auxin signalling. knock down of npr1
leads to hyperactivation of pr1 expression but, interestingly, has no
effect on disease resistance phenotypes, indicating that nimin1 suppresses only a subset of npr1-dependent genes.

suggesting that nrr also acts as a repressor of nh1. this paper and [13]

global transcript profiling in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and
under conditions optimised for maximal expression of npr1 target
transcripts identified a subset of co-ordinately induced genes that are
involved in secretion-related processes. reverse genetic approaches
were used to demonstrate that loss of bip2 (which functions as an
er-resident chaperone), defender against apoptotic death 1
(dad1, a co-chaperone) or sec61(which functions in protein transfer
across the er membrane) resulted in reduced secretion of pr1 protein,
compromised resistance to a virulent pst pathogen, and hypersensitivity
to chemical inducers of sar. collectively, these data suggest that the coordinated induction of proteins that are involved in co-translational folding
and modification of nascent polypeptides is an early npr1 function. a
consensus cis-element, tl1, was identified in the promoters of coordinately regulated er-resident genes. this element bound a sarinducible protein and was responsive to sar inducers. as induction of
the protein secretory machinery is a prerequisite for pr1 secretion, and as
the tl1-binding protein is also predicted to be translocated to the nucleus
following sar induction, these data further reinforce the need for coordinated nucleocytoplasmic crosstalk [19].

atwhy1 binds pb elements, which are enriched in sar-associated
genes, in an npr1-independent but sa-dependent manner. optimal
sa-induced defences require both npr1 and atwhy1, suggesting that
they might collaborate in transducing the sa signal.

salicylate esterase and implicate it in plant innate immunity.
proc natl acad sci usa 2005, 102:1773-1778.
the crystal structure of sabp2, a high-affinity (kd = 90 nm), low-abundance sa-binding protein, revealed that this protein is a member of the a/
b hydrolase superfamily. as such, it is phylogenetically related to tomato
meja esterase and brazil nut hydroxylnitrile lyase. co-crystallization of
sa with sabp2 revealed that sa binds tightly within the active site formed
by the catalytic triad ser-81, his-238 and asp-210. sabp2 exhibits strong
esterase activity toward physiological concentrations of mesa but is
potently inhibited by sa. sabp2 can also utilise methyl iaa (meiaa) and
meja as substrates, but at supra-physiological concentrations. contrary
to earlier observations, these authors found that, rather than being a sa
receptor, sabp2 probably functions in sar by converting inactive mesa
into active sa. depending upon the physiological state of the cell, this
active sa could regulate sabp2 activity by feedback inhibition. as
suppression of sabp2 blocks sar, this study raises the intriguing
possibility that mesa might have an as-yet-unrecognised role in local
or long-distance sa movement.

the arabidopsis thaliana sfd1 mutation suppresses the ssi2-conferred
npr1-independent expression of pr1 (see [42]). in sar-induced sfd1
plants, sa fails to accumulate in remote leaves and systemic immunity to
virulent pst is compromised. however, neither basal gene-for-gene
resistance nor local sa or pr1 accumulation are affected in sfd1. the
www.sciencedirect.com
sar deficiency of sfd1 npr1 double mutants is comparable to that of
single npr1 mutants, suggesting that sfd1 functions upstream of npr1.
sfd1 encodes a putative dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) reductase, and sfd1 plants have altered plastidial glycerolipid composition.
collectively, these data and those described in [42] provide strong
genetic and biochemical evidence that systemic signalling/perception
is dependent upon a lipid-derived signalling molecule.

kachroo a: role of salicylic acid and fatty acid desaturation
pathways in ssi2-mediated signaling. plant physiol 2005,
139:1717-1735.
the ssi2 gene encodes a stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) desaturase.
a previous study had shown that glycerol application mimicked the ssi2
phenotype, leading to the accumulation of sa and the induction of pr
genes, thus linking sa signalling to glycerol. a comprehensive genetic
analysis of the ssi2 phenotypes in double-mutant backgrounds concluded, first, that ssi2-triggered signalling requires components of both
the sa and the fatty acid pathways (i.e. eds1, pad4, eds5, sid2, fad7
and fad8); second, that the fatty acid desaturase fad7 fad8 double
mutants suppress the ssi2-triggered increase in sa levels; and third, that
glycerol- and ssi2-mediated signalling pathways overlap. this paper
provides a sobering perspective, highlighting the complexity of the sa
signalling network and linking primary carbon and fatty acid metabolism
with sa signalling. this work, in combination with that described in [41],
provides a potential new avenue for the exploration of the relationship
between lipid signalling and sar.

brassicicola. plant cell 2005, 17:2832-2847.
glip1 lipase is a member of the a/bserine hydrolase family, which
includes sabp2, eds1 and pad4. secretion of glp1 is induced by
sa, and loss of glip1 function renders plants susceptible to the necrotrophic a. brassicicola but not to hemi-biotrophic pst. glip1 disrupts
spore integrity, and this requires functional lipase activity. glip1 is shown
to encode dual functions as pre-treatment of infected leaves of glip1
abrogated the induction of local and systemic cell death by a. brassicicola
whereas exogenous application of glip1 alone did not, indicating that
glip1 (like dir1-overexpressing transgenic plants, which do not exhibit
constitutive sar) modifies or chaperones an signal that is generated by a.
brassicicola. consistent with the divergent signalling networks that are
engaged during pst and a. brassicicola infections, preliminary data
suggest that glip expression is ethylene-dependent, whereas its secretion is sa-dependent.

mol biol cell 2004, 15:5047-5052.
previous studies have shown that the activation of tobacco elicitin
receptors, leading to hr and sar, requires the formation of a sterol
elicitin complex and that wheat ltp1 binds these putative elicitin receptors. here, tobacco ltp1 is shown to bind ja, and when applied to a
decapitated tobacco plant, the ltp1√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúja complex provided 40% of the
protection against phytophthora parasitica invoked by the elicitin, cryptogenin. this study implicates ja in the activation of sar and suggests
that the biologically active signal is a lipid√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúprotein complex that binds a
dual-recognition receptor. notably, the brassinosteroid receptor also
binds systemin to initiate long-distance wound signalling in tomato
[54]. it remains to be determined whether this is the signal complex itself
or whether the activation of a local receptor generates the long-distance
signal.

activation tagging identified an aspartic protease gain-of-function
mutant, cdr1, that exhibits enhanced resistance to virulent pst. cdr1
closely resembles human cathepsin d, accumulates in the extracellular
fluid following challenge with avirulent pathogens and is involved in the
generation of a small (3 kda√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú10 kda) heat-labile mobile signal. antisense
cdr1 lines are compromised in basal and gene-for-gene resistance and
in systemic induction of pr1. conditional expression of cdr1 in rootstocks activated pr2 expression in wildtype scion grafts. similarly,
inoculation of intercellular fluids from plants that express cdr1 induced
local pr2 expression. cdr1, therefore, contributes to the generation or
modification of a yet-to-be-identified peptide-based [52] elicitor that is
involved in local and systemic resistance.

autophagy is a highly conserved process in which double-membranebound vesicles engulf cytoplasmic material and target it for degradation
in the vacuole or lysosome. n. benthamiana beclin 1, an orthologue of
the human and yeast becelin 1/atg6/vps30 autophagy gene, is essential
for containing local cell death and preventing systemic hypersensitive cell
death following the incompatible interaction between the n resistance
gene and tmv. yeast contains at least 16 autophagy-related genes
(atg), and silencing of each of the n. benthamiana beclin 1, pi3k/
vp34, atg3 and atg7 orthologues resulted in unrestricted tmv-induced
hypersensitive cell death. remarkably, autolysosomes were induced not
only at the site of tmv infection but also in distal uninfected leaves,
consistent with the observed systemic cell death in beclin 1-silenced
plants. systemic cell death was not due to viral spread, and both fungal
and bacterial hr elicitors also induced unrestricted cell death in plants
silenced for autophagy. these data add an additional layer of complexity
to what is known about systemic signalling processes, implicating an hrderived systemic cell-death signal(s), which is decoded or inactivated
distally and is degraded by autophagy. cdr1 [58] and the bonsai
(bon)/copine (cpn) proteins [67] are respective candidates for generation and distal perception of this √¢‚Ç¨Àúpro-death√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ signal.
