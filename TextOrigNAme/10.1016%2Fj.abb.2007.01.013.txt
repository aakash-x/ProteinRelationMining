abstract
as an outcome of normal autophagic degradation of ferruginous materials, such as ferritin and mitochondrial metalloproteins, the
lysosomal compartment is rich in labile iron and, therefore, sensitive to the mild oxidative stress that cells naturally experience because of
their constant production of hydrogen peroxide. diﬀusion of hydrogen peroxide into the lysosomes results in fenton-type reactions with
the formation of hydroxyl radicals and ensuing peroxidation of lysosomal contents with formation of lipofuscin that amasses in long-
lived postmitotic cells. lipofuscin is a non-degradable polymeric substance that forms at a rate that is inversely related to the average
lifespan across species and is built up of aldehyde-linked protein residues. the normal accumulation of lipofuscin in lysosomes seems to
reduce autophagic capacity of senescent postmitotic cells—probably because lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes continue to receive newly
formed lysosomal enzymes, which results in lack of such enzymes for autophagy. the result is an insuﬃcient and declining rate of auto-
phagic turnover of worn-out and damaged cellular components that consequently accumulate in a way that upsets normal metabolism.
in the event of a more substantial oxidative stress, enhanced formation of hydroxyl radicals within lysosomes jeopardizes the membrane
stability of particularly iron-rich lysosomes, speciﬁcally of autophagolysosomes that have recently participated in the degradation of
iron-rich materials. for some time, the rupture of a limited number of lysosomes has been recognized as an early upstream event in many
cases of apoptosis, particularly oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, while necrosis results from a major lysosomal break. consequently,
the regulation of the lysosomal content of redox-active iron seems to be essential for the survival of cells both in the short- and the
long-term.

the normal turnover of cellular components, as well as
the degradation and replacement of damaged or mal-
formed elements, is eﬀectively regulated and involves a
number of pathways (fig. 1). the lysosomal compartment
provides cells with the ability to recycle organelles and
long-lived proteins by a process termed autophagy (auto-
phagocytosis); see fig. 2 for a schematic representation
of the three diﬀerent forms of autophagy recognized in
mammalian cells (i.e. macro-, micro- and chaperone-medi-

partment is also a centre for the breakdown of extracellular
molecules that have been taken up by endocytosis. this is
particularly important for professional scavengers, such
as mobile and tissue-ﬁxed macrophage-type cells, including
retinal pigment epithelial cells (rpe)1.

vain. they suggested that the destabilization of lysosomes
might jeopardize the survival of cells and, therefore, nick-
named lysosomes ‘suicide bags’ [1]. however, lysosomes
look more or less normal under the transmission electron
microscope, even if a signiﬁcant amount of their many pro-
teolytic enzymes have leaked out, while they vary markedly
with regard to their sensitivity to stress [2,3]. thus, as evi-
denced below, lysosomes became incorrectly characterised
as sturdy organelles that do not disintegrate until the cell
is already devitalized. therefore, until about a decade
ago (reviewed in [4]), lysosomes were considered responsi-
ble only for necrosis, but not for the induction of pro-
grammed cell death (apoptosis) of still viable cells. this
old view is still reﬂected in many contemporary textbooks,
and diﬀering opinions on the matter have been expressed
until now.

endosomes, which receive lysosomal enzymes via vesicles from the trans-
golgi network (tgn). further maturation leads to lysosomes. some
cytosolic macromolecules are directly engulfed by invagination of the
lysosomal membrane (microautophagy), whereas organelles (e.g. mito-
chondria) are being enclosed by a newly formed membrane leading to
formation of an autophagosome (macroautophagy), which then can fuse
with either a late endosome or a lysosome (perhaps also with secretory
vesicles from the tgn) forming an autophagolysosome. certain proteins
are delivered to lysosomes with the help of chaperones such as hsp73
(chaperone-mediated autophagy).

leads to apoptosis; while a more general rupture results
in necrosis [4,10–12].
the accumulation within lysosomes of the age pigment,
lipofuscin, (as also of ceroid, which is very similar, or even
identical, at the molecular level despite being disease- and
not ageing-related) has been found to be a result of incom-
plete autophagic degradation with ensuing peroxidation of
remaining intralysosomal contents (reviewed in [13]). the
presence of redox-active iron within lysosomes is of funda-
mental importance both to the process whereby lysosomes
are destabilised under oxidative stress and also to the for-
mation of lipofuscin/ceroid. in the following parts of this
review some essentials about lysosomal labile iron will be
highlighted.
role of lysosomes in cellular iron metabolism
as indicated above, autophagy is a key function of the
lysosomal compartment in all cells, except erythrocytes that
lack organelles, including lysosomes. since many macro-
molecules contain iron (e.g. ferritin and mitochondrial
electron-transport complexes), the lysosomal compartment,
where autophagic degradation of these structures occurs, is
rich in this particular transition element [14–21]. when
fe(ii) does not have all of its six coordinates ligated, it is

capable of catalyzing a homolytic splitting of hydrogen
peroxide resulting in the formation of the extremely reac-
tive hydroxyl radicals (fenton reaction).

this is related to the low lysosomal ph (4.5–5.5) and the
presence of reducing equivalents, such as cysteine [22–24].
at ph around 5, cysteine reduces iron(iii) to iron(ii),
while the cys-s
that is formed is removed by combining
with cysteine and subsequent reduction of dioxygen. since
mitochondria undergoing autophagic degradation continue
to produce superoxide anion radicals for a while, the
intralysosomal reduction of fe(iii) to fe(ii) may also take
place
superoxide.
moreover, since lysosomes do not contain hydrogen perox-
ide-degrading enzymes, such as catalase or glutathione
peroxidase (except those autophagocytosed that are rapidly
degraded), any hydrogen peroxide molecules that diﬀuse
into lysosomes [25] will induce the formation of hydroxyl
radicals or similarly reactive iron-centered radicals.
through the reducing capacity of
redox-active iron is a threat to cells. therefore, iron is
cautiously transported and stored in a non-redox-active
form in transferrin and ferritin, respectively. lysosomes
seem to be the only place where large amounts of redox-ac-
tive iron temporarily exist before entering the cytosol for
further transit to sites where iron is either required for ana-
bolic purposes or destined for storage in ferritin. some
investigators believe that when low mass iron is required,
it is released directly within the cytosol [26,27]. however,
this may not necessarily be the case since some ﬁndings
point
to another mechanism for iron release, namely
through autophagic degradation of ferritin and iron-rich
mitochondrial proteins, followed by transport of lysosomal
low mass iron to the cytosol [17,19–21,28,29]. a strong
argument for this hypothesis is that exposure of cells in cul-
ture to inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes prevents the release
of iron from ferritin [29]. another important argument is
the ﬁnding that exposure of cells to dfo, which is endocy-
tosed and propagated into the lysosomal compartment
where it remains, results in a major decrease of cytosolic
labile (calcein-chelatable) iron [28]. since such a decline
of cytosolic labile iron would hardly occur if low mass iron
could be liberated directly in the cytosol, this ﬁnding sug-
gests that iron must be liberated from ferritin within lyso-
somes, where dfo will act as a sink for low mass iron,
preventing its transport to the cytosol [28].
at least some lysosomal low mass iron, although prob-
ably partly complexed, is apparently redox-active because
lysosomes burst when cells are under oxidative stress (see
above) as a result of the production of hydroxyl radicals
or similarly reactive iron-centered radicals. low mass iron,
released in late endosomes following transferrin-mediated
iron uptake from the outside of cells, is transported into
the cytosolic pool of labile iron with the help of nramp-
type proteins [30–32]. perhaps such proteins are also
involved in the transportation of lysosomal low mass iron
to the cytosol. we do not know, however, if iron bound
to transporters is readily redox-active. recently, evidence
was found for an alternative mechanism of delivering iron
from endosomes/lysosomes to mitochondria that involves
a direct transport between these two types of organelles
following temporary close contact [33].
a beneﬁcial side-eﬀect of ferritin autophagy, in relation
to lysosomal and cellular resistance to oxidative stress, is
that ferritin, before being degraded, might be able to tem-
porarily chelate intralysosomal labile iron, thereby reduc-
ing its concentration and, therefore, the sensitivity of
lysosomes to oxidative stress [34,35]. since autophagy is a
continual process (see above), degraded lysosomal ferritin
would constantly be replaced—and a state of equilibrium
would be created between cytosolic and lysosomal ferritin.
the concentration of lysosomal labile iron would then be
determined by the autophagic turnover of ferruginous
materials, the content of cytosolic iron binding proteins,
such as ferritin or metallothionein, which is another iron-
binding protein [24], and the rate of autophagy of such pro-
teins. this idea is compatible with the fact that cells rich in
ferritin, metallothioneins and some other stress-induced
phase ii proteins are indeed resistant to oxidative stress
[24,34,36,37]. if this hypothesis is correct, there is another
side to the coin. diseases involving iron-overload, such as
advanced conditions of haemochromatosis, in which ferri-
tin is more or less iron-saturated, then, rather than acting
as a protector of lysosomes, it might change into a mole-
cule that adds additional
increases
lysosomal sensitivity to oxidative stress.
iron and, therefore,
besides hemochromatosis, an increasing number of other
pathologies have been shown to depend on an intracellular
accumulation of iron (in particular within mitochondria
and lysosomes) with consequent enhanced sensitivity to oxi-
dative stress. as pointed out in this review, there is a close
relation between mitochondria and lysosomes; since the
former are degraded by the latter, any accumulation of iron
inside mitochondria will as well result in lysosomal iron
loading. friedreich ataxia is associated with a deﬁciency of
the frataxin protein, a mitochondrial iron chaperone that
chelates iron in a non-redox-active form and thus protects
from hydroxyl radical formation. it participates in the for-
mation of iron-sulfur clusters, which are cofactors of several
enzymes. the lack of frataxin results in the accumulation of
excessive amounts of labile iron intramitochondrially and
increased mitochondrial vulnerability to oxidative stress
that results in neuronal damage [38]. aceruloplasminemia
patients lack ferroxidase ceruloplasmin activity, which
results in iron accumulation within a variety of tissues with
neurologic symptoms, retinal degeneration and diabetes
[39,40]. sideroblastic anemia is characterized by iron-laden
perinuclear mitochondria of developing red blood cells
and, sometimes, neurons and other cell types, due to an enzy-
matic defect of the heme synthesis [41]. there is also accumu-
lating evidence that
iron accumulation
contributes to the development of several common neurode-
generative diseases, such as the alzheimer, parkinson and
huntington diseases [39,42].

fig. 3. role of lysosomes in iron metabolism. circulating transferrin-iron complexes bind to the transferrin receptors along the plasma membrane. this
complex is internalized by the cell forming an early endosome (receptor-mediated endocytosis). following maturation to an acidiﬁed late endosome, iron is
released to the cytoplasm, whereas transferrin and its receptor are transported back to the plasma membrane. iron from the cytoplasmic labile iron pool
(where it is bound only by weak chelators) is quickly used for incorporation into certain proteins or stored in ferritin. autophagy of iron-containing
proteins leads to release of iron inside lysosomes (or in the case of non-iron-saturated ferritin to a temporary iron binding prior to its degradation) from
where it is fed back into the labile iron pool.
for a schematic view on the involvement of lysosomes
in iron metabolism, see fig. 3, while fig. 4 shows the out-
come on hela cells of a cytochemical technique, the sul-
ﬁde-silver method—ssm, for the demonstration of heavy
metals, which normally means iron since this heavy metal
is the only one that normally occurs in any signiﬁcant
amount in most cells (except b-cells, prostatic epithelial
cells and some neurons, which all are rich in zinc).
when actively dividing cells are depleted of iron (e.g. by
being exposed to iron chelators) they ﬁrst stop proliferating
and then, within hours, start to show signs of apoptosis.
this response has been exploited in order to treat malig-
nancies, and several iron-chelators with enough speciﬁcity
for malignant cells are now in clinical trials [43]. paradox-
ically, it has been found that such apoptosis induced by
iron-depletion is preceded by lysosomal destabilization,
indicating that lysosomal damage can be induced both by
iron overload and by iron depletion [44,45]. this again sug-
gests that
labilization might be a common
upstream event in apoptosis induced by a variety of factors
in addition to the presence of oxidants.

degradation is the most important of the available path-
ways. lysosomal enzymes degrade not only cytosolic bio-
molecules, such as proteins and lipids, but also (by
macroautophagy) whole organelles, including mitochon-
dria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes and peroxisomes
[7,46]. there are good reasons to believe that worn-out lyso-
somes can also be turned over through macroautophagy, as
suggested by the presence of lysosomal membrane compo-
nents inside lysosomes [47,48] and by the accumulation of
altered lysosomes following inhibition of autophagy by
3-methyladenine [49]. proteins, mainly short-lived, are also
decomposed by proteasomes (multicatalytic proteinase
complexes), which are active in the cytoplasm, as well as
in the nucleus [50,51]. in addition, many short-lived cytosol-
ic proteins are cleaved by calpains, which are calcium
dependent cysteine proteases [52]. mitochondria possess
their own proteolytic system represented by the matrix
lon- and membrane-bound aaa proteases [53,54] allow-
ing degradation of some defective mitochondrial proteins
without autophagy.
although most altered biomolecules and organelles are
eﬃciently degraded, some of them accumulate with age,
suggesting the inherent inadequacy of the cellular turnover
mechanisms. because these damaged structures are partial-
ly or completely dysfunctional, yet occupying space and
interfering with normal cellular functions (see below), they
are called biological ‘garbage’ or ‘waste’ [55]. biological
includes lipofuscin, which is an intralysosomal
‘waste’
‘garbage’ material, as well as extralysosomally located
damaged macromolecules and organelles. fig. 5a illus-
trates the mechanisms behind lipofuscin formation in post-
mitotic cells, while fig. 5b shows the consequences of
enhanced oxidative stress, i.e. the stability of the lysosomal
membrane may be jeopardized because of extensive intra-
lysosomal ho
formation.
it has long been known that lipofuscin accumulation
and other manifestations of cellular ageing are primarily
observed in long-lived postmitotic cells, such as neurons,
cardiac myocytes and rpe cells [56]. in contrast, such
changes are not typical of intestinal epithelium, epidermis,
bone marrow or other actively proliferating cell popula-
tions. although mature enterocytes, keratinocytes and
blood cells are also postmitotic,
they are frequently
replaced through diﬀerentiation of stem cells, which is asso-
ciated with constant division resulting in multifold dilution
of biological ‘garbage’. over recent years, adult brains and
hearts have also been shown to contain stem cells that can
diﬀerentiate into mature neurons and myocytes [57,58].
however, the replacement of diﬀerentiated neurons and
myocytes (if any) occurs very slowly, making their life long
enough to accumulate considerable amounts of ‘waste’
material.
the only type of age-related damage that can readily
accumulate in proliferating cell populations is non-lethal
mutations that have neither been repaired nor eliminated
as a result of apoptosis. such nuclear and mitochondrial
fig. 5. consequences of intralysosomal formation of hydroxyl radicals under normal and oxidative stress conditions. under normal conditions, hydrogen
peroxide, originating mainly from mitochondria, is eﬃciently inactivated by the cell’s antioxidative shield. only a small portion of this oxidant manages to
diﬀuse into lysosomes, a compartment rich in cystein and redox-active iron, originating from the degradation of iron-containing proteins. hydrogen
peroxide and iron react in the fenton reaction yielding hydroxyl radicals, which lead to intralysosomal oxidation/peroxidation. some oxidation products
polymerize and become undegradable (lipofuscin) and thus accumulate in lysosomes of long-lived postmitotic cells, which do not dilute the pigment by
division (a). under oxidative stress conditions, the cellular anti-oxidative defence mechanisms may be overwhelmed [110], allowing diﬀusion of large
amounts of hydrogen peroxide into lysosomes, where an increased production of hydroxyl radicals not only leads to oxidation of lysosomal contents but
also to peroxidation of the lysosomal membrane, resulting in its subsequent rupture with release of harmful lysosomal enzymes. this applies to dividing as
well as non-dividing cells (b).

dna mutations may accumulate in actively proliferative
tissues [59,60], occasionally resulting in the development
of malignant tumours [61]. these facts, however, do not
exclude a fundamental role for the progressive alterations
of
in the ageing process
[56,62,63].
long-lived postmitotic cells
lipofuscin (age pigment) is an intralysosomal material
that cannot be degraded. it is primarily composed of oxida-
tively modiﬁed protein and lipid degradation residues. it
also contains some carbohydrates and metals, including
iron, copper, aluminum, zinc, calcium and manganese
[13,64]. lipofuscin has a yellow-brownish color and dis-
plays a wide-spectrum autoﬂuorescence. in the electron
microscope,
lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes usually appear
as irregularly shaped osmiophilic granules of variable size
and density.
the fact that lipofuscin cannot be degraded has been
demonstrated in cultured cardiac myocytes and ﬁbroblasts
that also failed to rid themselves of lipofuscin through exo-
cytosis [65–67]. these in vitro observations seem to be chal-
lenged by a recent study, showing that the removal of an
eyestalk of a crustacean may lead to a decrease of lipofus-
cin in the neurons of the contralateral eyestalk [68]. this
study, however, does not completely exclude a possible
reduction in lipofuscin content due to activation of neuro-
nal stem cell division and diﬀerentiation in response to
injury.
the
iron,
there is accumulating evidence that the conversion of
autophagocytosed material into undegradable substances
primarily occurs in lysosomes. the presence of redox-ac-
tive
free diﬀusion of hydrogen peroxide
through the lysosomal membrane, and low ph promote
the formation of hydroxyl radicals via fenton reactions
(see above). this causes massive radical damage to
autophagocytosed biomolecules
(many of which are
membrane-derived proteins and lipids) and cross-linking
of macromolecules ensues, making them resistant
to
degradation by lysosomal enzymes [69]. this hypothesis
is strongly supported by the fact that the combination
of oxidative stress and lysosomal protease inhibition
(which delays degradation of autophagocytosed macro-
molecules and thus allows more time for their oxida-
tion) dramatically accelerates
lipofuscin formation in
cultured cells [65].
lipofuscin can originate from diﬀerent types of auto- or
heterophagocytosed material. in many cells, especially in
highly aerobic ones, such as cardiac myocytes and neurons,
autophagocytosed mitochondria constitute the bulk of
intralysosomal undegradable material. the mitochondrial
lipofuscin components is evidenced by the
origin of
presence of abundant atp synthase
in
pigment-loaded lysosomes [70]. as suggested by experi-
ments on growth-arrested ﬁbroblasts, speciﬁc components
of lysosomes, such as membranes and proteins, may also
be sources of lipofuscin [49]. in professional scavenger cells
with active phagocytosis, such as macrophages, microglial
cells and rpe cells, a large portion of their lipofuscin
subunit
contents derives from heterophagocytosed extracellular
material [71–73].
although lipofuscin is often considered a harmless hall-
mark of ageing, there is accumulating evidence that this is
not the case. most importantly, lipofuscin has been found
to interfere with autophagy [67] thus decreasing intracellu-
lar turnover. lipofuscin-loaded rpe cells show decreased
capacity to phagocytose rod outer segments [74] and are
increasingly sensitive to light [75], perhaps explaining the
increased risk of macular degeneration in the elderly. inter-
estingly, the rate of lipofuscin accumulation is inversely
related to the lifespan, rapid in short-lived species, and
slow in long-lived ones when similar types of postmitotic
cells are compared [76], telling us that lipofuscin accumula-
tion,
indeed, most probably has deleterious eﬀects on
cellular function.
the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis theory of ageing
as pointed out earlier, lipofuscin progressively accumu-
lates within the lysosomal compartment, which, from a
physiological point of view, may be considered as a box
receiving enzymes by fusion with trans-golgi-derived vesi-
cles (formerly, primary lysosomes) and substrates to be
degraded by fusion with endosomes and autophagosomes.
at any speciﬁc moment, however, the compartment is
divided into a number of vacuoles with diameters usually
not exceeding 1–3 lm, showing fusion and ﬁssion and
exchange of material [9,77].
lipofuscin occupies increasingly larger portions of indi-
vidual lysosomes of long-lived postmitotic cells, often not
allowing them to contain any other type of material. how-
ever, lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes, which are bounded by a
10 nm thick lysosomal membrane, retain their ability to
receive acid hydrolases by fusion with late endosomes
and newly formed mature lysosomes. the number of lipo-
fuscin-loaded lysosomes (earlier termed residual bodies)
within long-lived postmitotic cells increases with age. as
a result, a large portion of newly formed lysosomal
enzymes ends-up within lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes where
they cannot perform any useful activity because lipofuscin
is undegradable.
consequently, in senescent postmitotic cells, large num-
bers of lysosomes contain nothing but lipofuscin and lytic
enzymes. as the number of lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes
increases, more and more newly produced lysosomal
enzymes are delivered from the trans-golgi area to lipofus-
cin-loaded lysosomes rather than to late endosomes or
autophagosomes where they would be able to perform
useful activities.
the aged cell may compensate for this ‘drainage’ of
lysosomal enzymes from useful purposes by increasing
the synthesis of lytic enzymes. finally, however, the pro-
duction of such enzymes can no longer be increased, and
from then on there will be a growing deﬁciency of lysosom-
al degradation capacity resulting in a prolonged half-life of
structures that are normally turned-over by autophagy.

fig. 6. imperfect autophagy and ‘waste’ accumulation. lysosomal enzymes are produced in the trans-golgi network (tgn) and transported via vesicles
to late endosomes that acidify and maturate into lysosomes (see fig. 2) that in turn fuse with autophagosomes (aps). the continual fusion and ﬁssion of
the lysosomal vacuoles ensures the distribution of acid hydrolases within the lysosomal compartment including aps. in contrast to a young cell (a) that
may contain only few lysosomes with the undegradable age-pigment lipofuscin (lf), senescent post-mitotic cells (b) contain a large number of lipofuscin-
containing lysosomes, to which more and more lysosomal enzymes are directed in a useless eﬀort to degrade lipofuscin. these lysosomal enzymes are lost
for useful purposes, e.g. for the degradation of newly autophagocytosed material, resulting in a delayed turnover and the accumulation of waste products.
damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria are indicated by dark shade. mt, mitochondria, aggr, indigestible protein aggregates (aggresomes).
paradoxically, however, senescent postmitotic cells contain
large amounts of lysosomal enzymes, although misplaced
in lipofuscin-containing lysosomes. the more extensive
the formation of lipofuscin-loaded lysosomes is, the larger
is the loss of lysosomal enzymes from normal activity and
the longer will be the half-life of structures that are normal-
ly degraded by autophagy. for a schematic view on the
function of the lysosomal compartment in young and
senescent cells, see fig. 6.
since mitochondria are turned-over by autophagy,
depression of this activity will result in the accumulation
of aged mitochondria with abnormal functions, such as
production of less atp and more ros than is normally
the case [78–80]. when the number of defective mitochon-
dria exceeds a certain threshold, we believe the cell would
be short of atp and oxidative stress would grow abnor-
mally intense. such cells would be unable to respond to
increased functional demands, being able to perform basic
tasks only, and thus inﬂexible in a way that is a general
characteristic of ageing. experimental support of the mito-
chondrial-lysosomal axis theory is provided by a recent
observation on cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes
showing that the rate of lipofuscin accumulation by single
cells positively correlates with both oxidative stress and
mitochondrial damage [81].
the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis theory of ageing [82]
suggests that decreased adaptability of senescent postmi-
totic cells is a consequence of intralysosomal accumulation
of lipofuscin that creates a situation where an insuﬃciency
of lysosomal enzymes makes normal autophagic turnover
increasingly diﬃcult. the result is an accumulation of
defective structures, especially mitochondria, which will
disturb the metabolism of the senescent postmitotic cell
in several ways;
lack of atp would be one important
feature. since lipofuscin is rich in iron, increased cellular
oxidative stress may also result in lysosomal rupture due
to intralysosomal fenton-type reactions and in apoptotic
cell death if lysosomal destabilization exceeds a certain
value [4].

surprising that studies on lysosomal stability during oxi-
dative stress revealed that, rather than being the sturdy
organelles they were earlier considered to be, lysosomes
were quite sensitive to oxidative stress, suﬀering mem-
brane labilization and rupture leading to apoptosis or
necrosis [4]. in this context, it is interesting to note that
the concentration of vitamin e in lysosomal membranes
is by far the highest of all cellular membranes and more
than 30 times higher than that of microsomal mem-
branes [83]. perhaps a selective pressure during evolution
to decrease peroxidative chain-reactions within lysosomal
membranes, following the formation of hydroxyl radi-
cals, or highly reactive iron-centered radicals, resulted
in an accumulation of
the chain-breaking antioxidant

labilization and
apoptosis remained controversial for many years, even
after
intralysosomal chelation of
redox-active iron by desferrioxamine (dfo) prevented
lysosomal rupture as well as apoptosis following exposure
to oxidative stress [84,85]. the reason for this uncertainty
was that dfo was assumed to penetrate cellular mem-
branes, albeit very slowly, and therefore dfo was not con-
sidered to operate intralysosomally, but rather in the
cytosol. later however, it became clear that dfo does
not pass cellular membranes but is taken up by ﬂuid-phase
endocytosis [86–88]. it was also proven that dfo has the
same eﬀect when it is conjugated to starch, when the result-
ing large complex can only be internalized by endocytosis
and, therefore, transported through early and late endo-
somes to lysosomes, where it remains without being
degraded [84].
exposure of cells
to hydrogen peroxide following
pre-treatment with the lipophilic iron-chelator, sih, which
eﬃciently binds most labile cellular iron (see below), signif-
icantly depresses lysosomal rupture as well as mitochondri-
al and cellular damage, indicating that hydrogen peroxide
per se is not injurious but requires the presence of redox-
active iron [45,89]. this ﬁnding raises the possibility that
cytosolic labile iron may be needed for oxidative stress-
induced apoptosis and that lysosomal destabilization and
apoptosis, respectively, could be independent phenomena.
in order
the case, we
exposed cells to a speciﬁc lysosomal detergent, msdh,
together with sih. it then turned out that lysosomal
labilization still caused apoptosis and, consequently, cyto-
solic labile iron is not required for apoptosis [kurz et al.
unpublished].
to ﬁnd out whether
this
is
in order to show a clear relation between lysosomal rup-
ture and damage to living cells (including apoptosis), it was
necessary to induce lysosomal rupture with methods other
than oxidative stress and without aﬀecting cellular labile
iron. ways of doing so include the use of lysosomotropic
photosensitizers, detergents and aldehydes. lysosomotropic
compounds are weak bases that become charged after
attracting one or more protons and then captured in the acid-
ic compartment due to a mechanism named proton trapping.
such compounds must have pka values between 6 and 10.
the most speciﬁc ones have pka values around 6, which
implies that they will become selectively protonized in lyso-
somes, since these have a ph of about 5, but not in the cytosol
or in compartments with a ph of about 7.
a commonly used lysosomotropic compound is the lipo-
philic ﬂuorochrome acridine orange (ao), which pene-
trates cellular membranes, has a pka value of 10 and,
thus, becomes protonized not only in lysosomes, but also
in the cytosol. ao is a metachromatic ﬂuorochrome that,
when activated by blue light, gives a distinct red ﬂuores-
cence at the high lysosomal concentration that results from
an exposure of living cells to a low concentration of ao,
and a weak green ﬂuorescence at the low cytosolic concen-
tration that is then obtained.
since lysosomal ao-emitted red ﬂuorescence under
exciting blue light implies an energy transfer strong enough
to form oxidizing singlet oxygen, ao is also a photo-sensi-
tizer. consequently, when cells are initially exposed to ao
and then illuminated with blue light, lysosomal membranes
are peroxidized and start to decompose [90].
some two decades ago, firestone and co-workers devel-
oped a number of synthetic lysosomotropic detergents (e.g.
msdh) that selectively rupture lysosomes [91]. later it
was shown that sphingosine is a natural lysosomotropic
detergent [11]. using msdh and sphingosine, it was possi-
ble to show that rupture of a moderate number of lyso-
somes
induced apoptosis, accompanied by caspase-3
activation, while more extensive lysosomal rupture induced
necrosis, without activation of such eﬀector caspases [10].
similarly, the lysosomotropic aldehyde 3-amino prop-
anal (3-ap) bursts lysosomes, as a result, it is thought, of
inactivating the thiol-rich lysosomal membrane proton
pump. these cells also undergo apoptosis or necrosis in
relation to the magnitude of lysosomal break [92,93].
these ﬁndings strongly suggest that lysosomal labiliza-
tion induces apoptosis, whether directly or indirectly, due
to the action of lysosomal contents, mainly proteolytic
enzymes [94,95]. the release of lysosomal contents also
induces mitochondrial damage resulting in the enhanced
production of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide
(i.e. oxidative stress; see further below),
implying that
lysosomal damage results in further oxidative stress and
lysosomal damage through an amplifying loop process [95].
additional evidence in favour of the hypothesis that
lysosomes may be generally involved in apoptosis appeared
when it was found that growth factor starvation and liga-
tion of the fas (cd95) death receptor induced lysosomal
labilization hours before any objective signs of apoptosis
were found [44]. in living cells, membrane destabilization
may only involve a minor percentage of all lysosomes, so
a very sensitive assay method is required to detect it. the
ao relocation method was introduced for this purpose
[96]. as pointed out above, ao is a metachromatic
lysosomotropic ﬂuorochrome that gives an intense red
ﬂuorescence at high concentrations, and a weak green
ﬂuorescence at low concentrations, when the exciting blue
light of an argon laser (488 nm) is used. the loss of a small
number of lysosomes is not easy to detect using the ao
uptake method, because a decline from an intense red
ﬂuorescence to a less intense one is diﬃcult to measure.
however, it turned out that assaying the increase of green
ﬂuorescence when a few lysosomes burst and release their
ao content to the cytosol is much more sensitive, since
green ﬂuorescence then increases from low values [97,98].
a disadvantage of the ao relocation method is that it
can only be used early in the process of lysosomal destabi-
lization, because lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes destabilize
the plasma membrane, causing relocalized ao to leak
out of the cell rather than increasing cytosolic green
ﬂuorescence. because of this, it is found that over the 30-
90 min following an initial lysosomal destabilization, the
228
t. kurz et al. / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 462 (2007) 220–230
early increase in cytosolic green ﬂuorescence secondary to
ao relocation is usually reversed to a decline and, ﬁnally,
when the plasma membrane is fully permeable to ao, there
is a diminished cytosolic green ﬂuorescence compared to
control cells. by then the cell has started the apoptotic pro-
cess, but many lysosomes are still intact and show bright
red ﬂuorescence.
many forms of apoptosis are regulated by activation of
the p53 gene. exactly how the p53 protein triggers the
apoptotic cascade is a topic of intense research [99]. if lyso-
somal labilization is a general phenomenon in apoptosis it
could be assumed that such labilization should be found
early in the process of p53 activation. the p53 protein
exists in a mutated thermolabile form that is inactive at
37 °c but structurally stable and active at 32 °c [100].
when cells that overexpress the thermolabile form of p53
at a stable rate are grown at 37 °c they are intact, but when
transferred to 32 °c they undergo apoptosis within 8–10 h.
by 3 h after the transfer to the lower temperature the cells
already start showing signs of early lysosomal destabiliza-
tion [98]. these ﬁndings add to the evidence that lysosomal
rupture may be an early upstream event in many forms of
apoptosis. additional proof is that cells exposed to ionizing
radiation also show early lysosomal labilization that occurs
before the start of clear-cut apoptosis [101–103].
even if lysosomes seem to be more deeply involved in
apoptosis than generally accepted, additional questions still
remain to be answered. first among those is the question as
to whether or not lysosomes are always labilized early in
the apoptotic process and, if so, how? lysosomal rupture
as a result of oxidative stress is well understood, but why
is ligation of the fas receptor and, perhaps, other death
lysosomal contents
receptors as well, or p53 activation, followed by lysosomal
destabilization? moreover, it is not well understood how
the release of
induces apoptosis,
although much new information has been gathered during
the last
few years. it has been found that cytosolic
phospholipases become activated by released lysosomal
contents, and that they in turn attack lysosomal and mito-
chondrial membranes [94]. it has also been demonstrated
that lysosomal cysteine cathepsins are able to truncate
and activate bid [104]. furthermore, under certain condi-
tions activated bax may attach to lysosomal membranes
and cause their destabilization [105].
recently, a protein was discovered (lapf-lysosome
associated apoptosis-inducing protein containing ph and
fyve domains), that is a member of a widespread new family
of proteins (phaﬁns-proteins containing the above domains),
and that induces apoptosis by attaching itself to lysosomal
membranes, causing lysosomal permeabilization and activa-
tion of the lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway [106].
it has also been reported that ligation of the tumour
necrosis factor receptor (tnf-r) and the fas receptor
(fas-r) induces activation of a neutral membrane-bound
sphingomyelinase that in turn causes the formation of
ceramide, which is cleaved into sphingosine [107]. sphingo-
sine is a lysosomotropic detergent causing lysosomal
labilization [11].
the
intimate relationship between lysosomes and
mitochondria in the execution of apoptosis is emphasized
in the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis theory of apoptosis
[95]. this theory (see fig. 7 for a schematic representation)
suggests that there is crosstalk between these two organ-
elles and an amplifying feedback loop that results in
fig. 7. the lysosomal-mitochondrial interplay in apoptosis. lysosomal membrane rupture can be induced in a number of diﬀerent ways causing
apoptosis. released lysosomal enzymes (le) can attack other proteins and mitochondria, triggering cytochrome c release with an ampliﬁcation of the
apoptotic program, leading to further lysosomal rupture. for details, see text.

increasing lysosomal rupture and mitochondrial permeabi-
lization with release of pro-apoptotic molecules. presently,
programmed cell death is often classiﬁed as type i and type
ii, where type i is the caspase-dependent form (classical
apoptosis), while type ii (autophagic) involves extensive
autophagy, in which cell components are chieﬂy degraded
by lysosomal enzymes [108]. it has, however, already been
found that this dichotomy does not hold and that overlaps
exist [109]. probably we will soon know if these cell death
mechanisms need to be partly or completely merged.
