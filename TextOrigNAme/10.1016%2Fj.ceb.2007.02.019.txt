hvps34, an ancient player, enters a growing game: mtor
complex1/s6k1 signaling
takahiro nobukuni, sara c kozma and george thomas
recent studies have shown that the nutrient input to the mtor
complex1/s6k1 signaling pathway is mediated by class 3 pi3k
or hvps34, the oldest member of the pi3k family. moreover,
studies to date would suggest that during the evolution of
multicellular organisms this ancient branch of the pathway was
merged with the growth-factor-hormone-controlled class 1
pi3k pathway at the level of mtor complex1 to control the
development and growth of the organism. however, hvps34
also plays a role in the regulation of macroautophagy ‚Äî the
mechanism by which cells generate nutrients, such as amino
acids, through the degradation of intracellular complexes,
including mitochondria and ribosomes. these functions of
hvps34 initially appear contradictory, since increased mtor
complex1 activation is triggered by increased amino acid
levels, while autophagy is triggered when cells are faced with
amino acid deprivation.

introduction
it has been known for nearly a decade that the mamma-
lian target of rapamycin (mtor) complex1 is exquisitely
sensitive to nutrients. however, there has been little
understanding of the underlying mechanisms which med-
iate this response, despite an increasing awareness of the
importance of this pathway in metabolic syndromes such
as diabetes, obesity and cancer. here we review the
recent Ô¨Ånding that hvps34 mediates nutrient signaling
to mtor. we also discuss a potential framework to
rationalize the distinct roles played by hvps34 in the
control of growth versus autophagy.
mtor complex1/s6k1
mtor and its downstream effector s6 kinase 1 (s6k1), as
well as initiation factor 4e binding protein (4e-bp1),
have emerged as critical signaling components in the
through s6k1 phosphorylation of
development, differentiation and growth of the organism
[1], as well as in the maintenance of normal metabolic
homeostasis [2,3]. in the case of s6k1, mtor appears to
inÔ¨Çuence these processes largely at the level of protein
synthesis,
target
proteins, such as ribosomal protein s6 [4], elongation
factor 2 kinase [5], and initiation factor 4b [6] as well
as raising the levels of initiation factor eif4a, through the
phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitor, pro-
grammed cell death protein 4 [7]. moreover, dysregula-
tion of this pathway is associated with a number of
pathological states, including obesity, insulin resistance
and cancer [3,8,9]. indeed, the rapamycin derivatives
cci779 (wyeth-ayerst) and rad001 (novartis) are
being used in phase ii and iii clinical trials for the
treatment of solid tumors [9].
in vivo, mtor requires two associated proteins to signal
to s6k1: raptor [10‚Äì12] and gbl [13]. this complex,
termed mtor complex1 [3], interacts with downstream
substrates through raptor, which recognizes substrates,
such as s6k1, through their tor signaling (tos) motifs
[14]. the rapamycins, when bound to fkbp-12, appear to
interfere with raptor‚Äôs ability to recruit substrates, such as
s6k1, to mtor, thus inhibiting their phosphorylation.
although gbl initially appeared to be required for a
signaling-competent mtor complex1 [13], this view
has recently been questioned [15]. further studies have
shown that mtor also exists in a second complex,
mtor complex2, which includes gbl, rictor and msin1
[16‚Äì19]. mtor complex2 appears to be the major kinase
involved in regulating the phosphorylation of s473 on
protein kinase b (pkb/akt), one of the two key residues
required for the phosphorylation of speciÔ¨Åc substrates
(see figure 1). the rapamycins do not normally inhibit
mtor complex2, although, under conditions of chronic
exposure to the drug, they may do so, since they are able
to bind nascent mtor prior to its assembly into mature
mtor complex2. both mtor complexes are activated
by mitogens; however, only the mtor complex1/s6k1
signaling branch responds to nutrients, including amino
acids and glucose [20]. thus, to propagate downstream
signals, mtor complex1/s6k1 must integrate growth
factor and hormone signals with those of nutrients.
earlier studies have demonstrated that growth factors and
hormones, such as insulin, regulate mtor complex1/
s6k1 activation via class 1 pi3k. upon insulin stimu-
lation, the insulin receptor autophosphorylates at speciÔ¨Åc
tyrosine residues, leading to the creation of speciÔ¨Åc dock-
ing sites. one of these sites acts to recruit irs1 and irs2

with amino acids acting through hvps34. hvps34 also participates in the regulation of autophagy.
(see figure 1), leading to their increased phosphorylation
and to recruitment of adaptor molecules, such as the p85
regulatory subunit of class 1 pi3k [21]. in the case of class 1
pi3k, bringing the lipid kinase to the vicinity of the
membrane leads to the transient production of the second
messenger phosphatidylinositol (ptdins (3,4,5)p3). ptdins
(3,4,5)p3 binds to the n-terminal plextrin-homology (ph)
domain of pkb/akt, recruiting pkb/akt to the membrane,
where it is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-depen-
dent protein kinase 1 (pdk1) [22,23] and mtor com-
plex2 [19]. activated pkb/akt then acts to phosphorylate
tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) protein 2, which joins
with tsc1 to make up a tumor suppressor complex associ-
ated with the autosomal-dominant genetic disorder, tsc
[24]. phosphorylation of tsc2 is thought to target tsc2
for destruction [25] or for 14-3-3 sequestration, where 14-3-
3 proteins bind phosphorylated tsc2, thus keeping tsc2
in the cytosol and away from tsc1, which is always at the
membrane [26]. in this way, the formation of the functional
tsc1/tsc2 complex is inhibited [27], which may be a
mechanism for inhibiting tsc2 tumor suppressor activity.
in turn, tsc1/tsc2 functions as a gtpase that drives ras
homologue enriched in brain (rheb) [28] into the inactive
gdp-bound state [29‚Äì32]. rheb directly interacts with
mtor complex1, thus stimulating its ability to signal
downstream to s6k1 [33]. the outcome of the insulin-
induced response is elevated levels of protein synthesis
and increased cell growth (see figure 1).
the mechanism by which nutrients, such as amino acids
and glucose, signal to mtor complex1/s6k1 is largely
unknown. the importance of understanding this
phenomenon has been underscored by two recent obser-
vations: Ô¨Årst, that this branch of the pathway appears to
play a critical role in insulin resistance, through a negative
feedback loop from mtor complex1/s6k1 to irs1 [3]
(see figure 1), and second, that in the environment of a
solid tumor, where nutrients may be scarce, upregulation
of this branch of the pathway may facilitate tumor growth
[20]. recent studies have indicated that the amino acid

mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling nobukuni, kozma and thomas 137
response is, in part, mediated by a novel signaling pathway that is triggered by class 3 pi3k, also known as
human vacuolar protein sorting 34 (hvps34) [34,35]
(see figure 2). hvps34 differs from class 1 pi3k in its
substrate specificity and salt requirement in in vitro
assays, in its binding partners and in its primary structure.
in vitro, class 1 pi3k is more active with mg2+ than with
mn2+, whereas hvps34 exhibits the opposite preference.
moreover, hvps34 uses ptdins (phosphoinositide) as a
substrate to produce ptdins(3)p1, whereas class 1 is more
active toward ptdins(4, 5)p2 to produce ptdins(3,4,5)p3.
the catalytic subunits of both class 1 pi3k and hvps34
harbor a c2 domain, pik domain and lipid kinase domain,
though class 1 also has a p85-binding and a ras-binding
domain. in addition, both lipid kinases form heterodimers
with unique regulatory subunits: the adapter protein p85
for class 1 pi3k, and s/t protein kinase p150 for hvps34.
the role of amino acids in mtor complex1/s6k1
signaling was initially demonstrated in studies on macroautophagy, a cellular process in which portions of cytoplasm are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles
known as autophagosomes before being delivered to
lysosomes for degradation and recycling of cellular components [36]. earlier studies showed that inhibition of
macroautophagy by the addition of amino acids was
directly paralleled by increased s6 phosphorylation and
that this response was suppressed by rapamycin [37].
subsequently, it was shown that amino-acid-induced
s6k1 activation was dependent on mtor complex1
[38√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú40]. moreover, a number of studies have shown that
figure 2
essential amino acids, especially the branched-chain
amino acids (bcaas), are critical in potentiating mtor
complex1/s6k1 signaling [41]. however, it is clear that
non-essential amino acids can also affect mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling [38,39], consistent with their role in
driving early embryonic growth [42], a process in which
mtor complex1 has been implicated [43].
the yeast orthologue of hvps34 was first identified in a
screen for genes involved in vacuolar protein localization
and processing [44]. further genetic [45,46] and biochemical [47,48] studies revealed that hvps34 resides
in a membrane-associated complex with a serine/threonine kinase, hvps15, whose activity is essential for
hvps34 function [45]. the sequence of hvps34 contains
a c2 ca2+-binding motif [49] at its n-terminus, which was
recently identified as the domain by which hvps34 interacts with beclin, the human orthologue of the autophagic
gene atg6 [50]. the c2 ca2+-binding motif of hvps34 is
followed by a conserved pik accessory domain, first
described in yeast pi4k [51], and a highly conserved
lipid kinase domain located at the c-terminus [47].
hvps15 (p150) contains a consensus sequence for the
addition of myristic acid at its n-terminus, which is
thought to target the hvps34/hvps15 complex to membranes, followed by a conserved serine/threonine catalytic
kinase domain, a single heat repeat, and multiple
wd40 repeats. moreover, rabs have been shown to bind
to the heat and wd40 protein-interaction domains of
hvps15, which may direct the hvps34/hvps15 complex to
distinct intracellular compartments (see below). at these
sites of recruitment, ptdins(3)p1 is produced, which in
turn acts to recruit proteins containing fyve or px
domains [52]. many of these fyve- and px-domaincontaining proteins are thought to be rab effectors [53].

www.sciencedirect.com
the link between hvps34 and mtor complex1 signaling
emerged independently in studies designed to elucidate
the mechanism by which nutrient input, particularly of
amino acids and glucose, leads to increased s6k1 t389
phosphorylation as a readout of mtor complex1 activation [34,35]. initially it was presumed that amino acids
affected mtor complex1/s6k1 by acting through the
generic class 1 pi3k branch of this pathway [35]. in the
absence of tsc1/tsc2, although mtor complex1/
s6k1 activation was elevated and refractive to stimulation
by mitogens [54√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú56], such as insulin, it was still regulated
by amino acids [35]. however, this was not the case for
rheb, as sirna knock-down of rheb protein levels
blocked both the insulin and amino acid input to s6k1
[35]. nonetheless, withdrawal of amino acids, which
triggers s6k1 inactivation, had no effect on elevated
rheb√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúgtp levels in tsc2-deficient cells, leading to
the hypothesis that endogenous, in contrast to overexpressed, rheb√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúgtp [29] is necessary, but not sufficient,
to drive s6k1 activation in the absence of amino acids.
current opinion in cell biology 2007, 19:135√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú141
138 cell regulation
the reason for the difference between the amino acid
requirements associated with endogenous and overexpressed rheb is not entirely understood. however, our
unpublished results suggest that, normally, amino acids
are necessary to induce a change in rheb localization or a
conformational change in mtor complex1 that allows
active rheb (or an immediate target effector of rheb
other than mtor) to trigger mtor substrate phosphorylation. however, it appears that an overwhelming
amount of active rheb can bypass this activation mechanism and signal to mtor without amino acid stimulation. these findings suggested that the amino acid
input to mtor complex1/s6k1 acts on a pathway parallel to the tsc1/2√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúrheb axis. as earlier studies demonstrated that wortmannin, a class 1 pi3k inhibitor, blocked
amino acid-induced s6k1 activation and that amino acids
did not induce pkb activation [38,40], this suggested that
a novel wortmannin-sensitive signaling component was
responsible for mediating the amino acid input to the
mtor complex1/s6k1. these observations led to the
identification of hvps34 as the novel wortmannin-sensitive target by which these responses were mediated
[34,35]. in brief, it was shown that ectopic expression
of hvps34 drives s6k1 activation in the presence, but not
in the absence, of amino acids, and that this effect is
blocked by sirnas [34,35] or neutralizing antibodies
[34] directed against hvps34. moreover, stimulation of
cells with amino acids appears to increase hvps34 activity,
as measured by the production of ptdins(3)p1. consistent
with hvps34 mediating the amino acid input to s6k1, this
response is attenuated by expression of a cdna whose
protein product contains two fyve domains and binds to
ptdins(3)p1, blocking the binding of fyve- or pxdomain-containing proteins and preventing s6k1 activation [34,35]. interestingly, hvps34 is the only pi3k
found in yeast. indeed, it may be that, during the evolution of metazoans and the rise of systemic hormonal
regulation, the insulin√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúclass 1 pi3k signaling pathway
was merged with the primordial amino-acid-driven class 3
pi3k signaling pathway so that both pathways act through
the mtor complex1 to control the growth and development of the organism (see figure 1).
the mechanism by which ptdins(3)p1 signals to mtor
complex1/s6k1 is not known; however, the data above
suggest that it requires the increased production of
ptdins(3)p1. one possibility is that hvps34, through
ptdins(3)p1, acts to increase the intracellular concentrations of amino acids, either by enhancing their uptake
from the external milieu or by increasing protein degradation through macro- or microautophagy. to test this
possibility, the concentration of individual amino acids
was measured in hela cells in which hvps34 protein
levels were depleted by sirna treatment. the amino
acid content did not differ between cells treated with
hvps34 sirna and those treated with a control sirna (t
nobukuni and g thomas, unpublished). this indicates
current opinion in cell biology 2007, 19:135√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú141
that hvps34 stimulation of mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling is not mediated through increased levels of amino
acids, but instead acts as a component of the pathway
downstream of amino acids. given the role of ptdins(3)p1
in recruiting proteins containing either fyve or px
domains, it is highly possible that hvps34 is involved
in forming a signaling complex that includes mtor
complex1 and potentially s6k1 (see below). it should
also be noted that glucose depletion has been reported to
inhibit hvps34 activity, suggesting that amino acids or
glucose are converging through a common mechanism
to activate mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling [34].
although earlier it was argued that glucose signals to
mtor complex1/s6k1 through the activation of ampk
kinase and the phosphorylation of tsc2 [57], this model
has been called into question by two recent publications.
these studies showed that redd1, which negatively
regulates mtor activity in response to energy deprivation, does not require ampk to mediate this response
[58], and reagents that affect ampk activity affected a
downstream target of mtor, eef2 kinase, in the
absence of tsc2 [59]. it should also be noted that energy
deprivation does not have an immediate impact on intracellular amino acid levels, nor does amino acid deprivation affect atp levels [60]. key questions, then, are the
identity of the mechanism leading to hvps34 activation,
and whether this mechanism is shared by amino acids,
glucose and other nutrients.
autophagy and endosome signaling
hvps34 is known to play a critical role in autophagy, and has
been shown to directly interact with the autophagic gene
beclin. beclin was first identified as a bcl-2-interacting
protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen [61]. subsequently it
has been shown to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor
gene [62,63], and it has been demonstrated that overexpression of bcl-2 disrupts the hvps34√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúbeclin interaction
[64]. moreover, it is hypothesized that, in a nutrientreplete setting, bcl-2 inhibits autophagy by sequestering
beclin away from hvps34 [64]. however, this latter view
has been challenged recently, in that bcl-2 and hvps34 are
argued to bind within the same complex through two
distinct domains in beclin, along with a third protein,
uvrag, which is also a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor
gene [65]. how then does hvps34 trigger autophagy?
recent studies have led to the identification of a wd40repeat-containing protein, hwipi-1a (wipi49) (see
figure 1), the human orthologue of the yeast autophagy
gene atg18, which, following amino acid deprivation, colocalizes with the autophagosomal marker lc3 at punctate
cytoplasmic structures in cells. moreover, structural
analysis data suggest that hwipi-1a contains an evolutionarily conserved phospholipid-binding domain [66]. in
yeast, this domain has been shown to bind ptdins(3)p1 and
to be involved in the formation of the pre-autophagosome
structures (pass) [67], which act as a donor compartments
for the biogenesis of autophagosomes [68]. given the
www.sciencedirect.com
mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling nobukuni, kozma and thomas 139
common role of wd40-repeat-containing proteins in
coordinating multiprotein complex assemblies, with the
repeating units serving as a rigid scaffold for protein
interactions [69], it has been hypothesized that hwipi1a may also act as a scaffold for building the autophagosome [66].
the suggestion that hvps34 is a positive effector in both
autophagy and mtor complex1/s6k1 signaling appears
incongruent because autophagy is thought to be under the
negative control of mtor [36]. a potential explanation is
that hvps34 may be operating in specific cellular compartments. as indicated above, hvps34 potentially plays a
distinct role in the recruitment of hwipi-ia during the
generation of the autophagosome. however, it is known
that the hvps34/hvp15 complex is also recruited to early
endosomes by rab5 [70] through the direct interaction of
rab5 with the carboxyl tail of hvp15 [71]. in this way, rab5
is more readily able to recruit its downstream fyvedomain effector early-endosomal autoantigen 1 (eea1)
to early endosomes, where it is required for endosome
fusion [72]. the primary roles of hvps34 in endosomes are
in growth-factor-receptor sorting and the formation of
intralumenal endosomal vesicles; it does not appear to play
a role in targeting cargo to the late endosome/lysosome
[73]. interestingly, early endosomes have been implicated
in signaling [74]. the concept of endosome signaling
emanates from studies showing that, following ligand
addition, activated epidermal growth factor receptors were
found on early endosomes with their downstream signaling
effectors. similarly, nerve growth factor was found with its
activated trka receptor and phospholipase g1 (plc-g1) in
endocytic organelles, which were capable of signaling to
downstream effectors such as mapk [74]. relevant to this
concept, we have found that mtor complex1 co-immunoprecipitates with hvps34 (p gulati and g thomas,
unpublished), and others have reported that rheb, through
its carboxyl caax box, associates with the golgi [75].
these findings raise the possibility that mtor complex1
may signal to downstream effectors through such vesicles.
future perspectives
given the ability of mtor complex1 to suppress autophagy, and the importance of both endosome trafficking
and autophagy to the malignant phenotype, it will be
critical to identify the mechanisms by which these two
pathways interact at the intracellular level. currently,
hvps34 and hvps15 are the only known components of
the pathway linking nutrient input to mtor complex1
activation. thus, identifying the upstream and downstream elements of this pathway will be critical to deciphering the mechanism of the cellular response to
nutrients. to find the downstream targets of hvps34, it
will be important to find the ptdins (2)p1-binding protein
responsible for the activation of the pathway, especially
since it seems that hvps34√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ability to produce ptdins
(3)p1 is critical for activation of the pathway. it is also of
www.sciencedirect.com
importance to find the binding partners of hvps34/
hvps15 to identify the upstream regulator of the pathway.

of bcl-2. they also show that transgenic expression of bcl-2 in heart

inhibits cardiac muscle autophagy. finally, beclin 1 mutants defective in
bcl-2 binding promote higher levels of autophagy than wild-type beclin 1.

 autophagic and tumour suppressor activity of a novel
beclin1-binding protein uvrag. nat cell biol 2006,
8:688-699.
this paper reports the identification of a novel coiled-coil uv irradiation
resistance-associated protein (uvrag) as a component of a bcl-2√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú
beclin√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúhvps34 complex, required for autophagy. uvrag is monoallelically mutated at increased frequency in human colon cancers. the
uvrag-mediated activation of the bcl-2√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúbeclin√¢‚Ç¨‚Äúhvps34 complex promotes autophagy and suppresses the proliferation of human colon
cancer cells. thus uvrag appears to be a tumor suppressor candidate.

cancer and is linked to starvation-induced autophagy.
oncogene 2004, 23:9314-9325.
wd-repeat proteins are b-propeller platforms that are involved in the
assembly of multiprotein complexes. wipi-1a is a member of a novel wdrepeat protein family, which plays a positive role in autophagy in yeast and
c. elegans. the data presented in this study suggest that human wipi
proteins share an evolutionarily conserved function in autophagy, playing
a critical role in generating the autophagosome. moreover, wipi genes
were found to be aberrantly expressed in a variety of matched tumor
tissues, suggesting that they may be compromised in human cancers.
