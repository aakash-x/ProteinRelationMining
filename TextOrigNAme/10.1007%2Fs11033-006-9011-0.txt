the molecular machinery responsible for yeast and
mammalian autophagy has begun to be elucidated at

that carboxyl terminus of osatg8 can be cleaved in

served gly117 residue of osatg8 was essential for its
characteristic c-terminal cleavage as similar to that
found in mammalian and yeast atg8. we further
proved that osatg8 interacted with osatg4, and this
interaction was not affected by the conserved gly117
mutation. our results demonstrate that atg8 conju-

introduction
autophagy is a highly regulated process for bulk
degradation of proteins and organelles, and it has been
shown to be essential for differentiation and develop-
ment as well as for cellular maintenance [1]. with the
advantages of yeast genetics, the molecular components
of autophagy have been revealed and the autophagy is
well characterized in yeast [2–6]. an essential protein in
the yeast autophagic pathway is atg8. after a series of
post-translational modiﬁcation including the character-
istic c-terminal cleavage, atg8 is covalently conjugated
to phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and localizes to
autophagosome membranes, which promotes the for-
mation of autophagosome and their delivery to the
vacuole for subsequent degradation [6–11]. one of the
proteins involved in the post-translational modiﬁcation
of yeast atg8 is atg4, which is a cysteine protease that
cleaves off the c-terminal amino acid of atg8 to expose
a c-terminal glycine [11]. the c-terminal glycine of
yeast atg8 is strictly conserved in all mammalian and
arabidopsis homologues [12–15].
for plant, protein degradation is important to adapt
to various severe environmental conditions, such as
nutrient deprivation [16]. a recent genome-wide
search revealed signiﬁcant conservation among auto-
phagy genes (atgs) in yeast and arabidopsis, indicat-
ing that the molecular basis of autophagy is well
conserved in yeast and plants. in arabidopsis, 25 atg
genes that are homologous to 12 of yeast atg genes
were found [15, 17–19]. among them, atatg7 and
atatg9 have been shown to be involved in arabidopsis
autophagy [17], atatg8 and atatg4 are essential for
arabidopsis autophagy [18–21]. up till now, however,
274

there are no reports about rice autophagy associated
genes.
in this report, we isolated osatg8 and osatg4,
two autophagy associated genes in rice, and detect
their expression patterns in several tissues. immu-
noblotting analysis showed that carboxyl terminus of
osatg8 can be cleaved in yeast cell, but mutation of
gly-117 into ala of osatg8 results in the abrogation
of c-terminal cleavage. we further proved that
osatg8 interacted with osatg4, and this interaction
was not affected by the conserved gly117 mutation.
our
results demonstrate that atg8 conjugation
pathway is conserved in rice and may play important
roles in rice autophagy.
materials and methods
plant materials
light
rice (oryza sativa, cv zhenxian 97b) was grown under
white ﬂuorescent
(wavelength 390–500 nm,
150 lem-2s-1, 12 h photoperiod) at 25°c and 70%
relative humidity. young leaves, young roots and leaf
sheaths were prepared from 2-week-old seedlings, and
mature leaves, mature roots and spikes were taken
from mature plants grown in the ﬁeld. all materials
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°c
before the operation.
semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis
total rnas were extracted from mature leaves, young
leaves, mature roots, young roots, leaf sheaths and
spikes using trizol reagent (gibco brl, usa).
first-strand cdna was generated using superscript ii
reverse transcriptase (invitrogen). two pairs of prim-
ers (named osatg8-a/b and osatg4-a/b; see table 1)
were designed for osatg4 and osatg8 tissue expres-
sion pattern analysis. the templates were ampliﬁed at
95°c for 5 min, followed by 28 cycles of ampliﬁcation
(94°c for 30 s, 58°c for 30 s, 72°c for 30 s), then 72°c
for 10 min. the rice actin gene (genebank acc. no.:
x16280) using speciﬁc primers actin-a/b (table 1) was
also ampliﬁed as control. pcr products were analyzed
on 1% agarose gels.
plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis
we subcloned osatg8 to pgbkt7 vector (clontech)
by adding a 6 · his tag (catcatcaccatcac-
cat) to their c terminus using the primers pgbkt7-
osatg8-a and pgbkt7-osatg8-b. to construct
pgbkt7-osatg8-g117a-his, we used site-directed
mutagenesis (quikchange site-directed mutagenesis
kit was from stratagene) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol using desired mutation primers and
templates. the full-length orf of atg4 was ampli-
ﬁed by pcr and subcloned into pgadt7 vector
(clontech). all names of the primers and the mutants
of amino acids are given in table 1. all plasmids were
conﬁrmed by sequencing.
yeast transformation and western blotting
pgbkt7-osatg8-his and pgbkt7-osatg8-g117a-
his were introduced to the saccharomyces cerevisiae
strain ah109 via the lithium acetate transformation
method according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
the transformant was grown at 30°c in 5 ml sd media

resuspended for immunoblotting analysis [15]. the
proteins were resolved by 12% sds-page and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. after
blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing
0.2% tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h, the
membrane was probed with a speciﬁc mouse anti-myc
antibody (1:1000) or anti-his antibody (1:1000) for 2 h
and then washed and exposed to horseradish peroxi-
dase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg antibodies
(1:10000) for 1 h. the bound antibodies were visual-
ized with a photope-hrp western detection kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (cell
signaling technology).

constructs were then assessed by selection upon
media additionally lacking both adenine and histidine.
the addition of 40 lm x-a-gal (glycosynth, war-

results and discussion
identiﬁcation and isolation of osatg8 and osatg4
according
(genbank acc. no.: nm118319)
in this report, we use the amino acid sequence of
atatg8a
and
atatg4b (genbank acc. no.: ab073171) to search the
rice nr database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and
two cdna sequences were obtained, respectively. two
pairs of primers (named osatg8/4-a and b; see
table 1) were designed based on two cdna sequences
and used for pcr ampliﬁcation, cdnas reverse tran-
scribed from rice total rnas used as templates. the
pcr products were cloned into the pgem-t vector
(promega) and sequenced using the bigdye terminator
sequencing kit and abi377 sequencer (perkinelmer
life sciences)
to the manufacturer’s
instructions. according the arabidopsis homologues,
the two novel cdnas were named osatg8 and sub-
mitted to genbank (genbank acc. no.: dq269983)
and osatg4 (genbank acc. no.: dq269984), respec-
tively. osatg8 localizes to chromosome 7 and consists
of ﬁve exons and four introns (fig. 1a). sequence
comparison indicates that osatg8 shows 84% and 73%
amino acid identities with the arabidopsis and yeast
homologues, respectively, and all members contain the
conserved c-terminal gly residue (fig. 2a). osatg4
localizes to chromosome 4 and consists of eight exons
and seven introns (fig. 1b). osatg4 shows low simi-
larity to yeast and arabidopsis atg4, but the cys-164,
asp-361 and his-361 of osatg4 are strictly conserved
in all homologues (fig. 2b), which constitute the con-
served geometry observed in the canonical catalytic
triad of cysteine protease [22]. these results demon-
strated the autophagy associated genes are conserved
in rice.
fig. 3 expression pattern analyses of osatg8 and osatg4 in
various tissues. multi-tissue rt-pcr was performed to examine
the tissue distribution of osatg8 and osatg4. the tissues are
indicated above the panels and rice actin gene was used as an
internal control to show the consistent amount of beginning
rna for rt-pcr
fig. 4 expression of osatg8 and its mutant in yeast. yeast
ah109 was transformed with expression vectors pgbkt7 (lane
1), pgbkt7-osatg8-his (lane 2) or pgbkt7-osatg8-g117a-
his (lane 3), respectively. cell lysates were analyzed by western
blotting with anti-myc antibodies or anti-his antibodies
expression analysis
multi-tissue rt-pcr was performed to examine the
tissue distribution of osatg8 and osatg4. as showed
in fig. 3, osatg8 and osatg4 could be detected from
mature leaves, young leaves, mature roots, young
roots, leaf sheaths, and spikes which indicated they are
constitutive expressed gene and maybe have important
role in rice.

in a yeast two-hybrid analysis
carboxyl terminus of mammalian lc3, which is the
homologues of yeast atg8, can be cleaved by a cysteine
protease—atg4, and the cleavage leads to the expo-
sition of gly120 [22–25]. to investigate whether
osatg8 also undergoes the c-terminal cleavage in
yeast cells, we constructed pgbkt7-osatg8-his,
which produced fusion proteins containing an n-ter-
minal c-myc epitope tag and a c-terminal 6·his tag.
when pgbkt7-osatg8-his protein was expressed in
yeast, a band was recognized by immunoblotting with
anti-myc antibody, but not with anti-his antibody
(fig. 4, lane 2). these results demonstrated that the c-
terminal his6 tag was removed from fusion proteins
upon expression and the c-terminal cleavage occurred
in osatg8, consistent with the observation in mam-
malian lc3 [12]. yeast atg8 and osatg8 may have
similar structure and the c-terminal of osatg8 was
hydrolyzed by yeast atg4 because ah109 is not an
atg4 deﬁcient strain.
the only known residue for post-translational
modiﬁcations of yeast atg8 and rat lc3 is the con-
served gly-120, which is
conserved in osatg8
(fig. 2a). it has been shown that mutation of gly-120
into ala of lc3 resulted in the abrogation of a serial of
post-translational modiﬁcations [11, 12]. to clarify in a
straightforward manner whether cleavage of the car-
boxyl terminus of osatg8 in yeast requires gly117, we
constructed pgbkt7-osatg8-g117a -his to deter-
mine the effect of this mutation on their processing.
expression of mutant pgbkt7-osatg8-g117a-his,
in which gly117 of osatg8 were changed to ala, re-
sulted in a single band that was recognized by both
anti-myc and anti-his antibodies (fig. 4, lane 3), which
is in agreement with the obligatory role of conserved
gly-117 residue for
the c-terminal cleavage of
osatg8. these results demonstrated that the atg8
post-translational modiﬁcation pathway is conserved in
rice.
atg4 interacts with atg8 and hydrolyzes its c-terminal
in yeast, a direct interaction between their rice homo-
logues would strengthen the hypothesis that both rice
genes are in the autophagy pathway. mutation of gly-
117 into ala of osatg8 resulted in the abrogation of its
c-terminal cleavage, but we did not know whether this
mutation affected the interaction between osatg4 and
osatg8. to identify any interaction between osatg4
and osatg8 or its mutants, we performed a two-hybrid
assay. as showed in fig. 5, atg4 interacts with atg8
and its mutants,
indicating the conserved gly117
mutation does not affect this interaction. this cleavage
reaction may include two-step mechanism involving
the recognition of the osatg8 core and the subsequent
recognition of the osatg8 tail by osatg4. the tail
region of osatg8 is crucial for hydrolysis, but it is
not indispensable to the interaction between the core
region of osatg8 and osatg4.
