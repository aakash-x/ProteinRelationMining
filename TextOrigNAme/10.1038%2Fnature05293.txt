cell death in the nervous system
dale e. bredesen1,2, rammohan v. rao1 & patrick mehlen1,3 
neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease and parkinson’s disease trigger neuronal cell death 
through endogenous suicide pathways. surprisingly, although the cell death itself may occur relatively late 
in the course of the degenerative process, the mediators of the underlying cell-death pathways have shown 
promise as potential therapeutic targets.
thank heaven! the crisis — the danger, is past, and the 
lingering illness, is over at last — and the fever called 
“living” is conquered at last.
from for annie, by edgar allan poe
programmed cell death (pcd) has a critical role in the development 
of the nervous system, and both anti-pcd and pro-pcd modulators 
feature prominently in the establishment of neural architecture. it has 
been 100 years since the first description of developmental neuronal-
cell death1, and more than 50 years since levi-montalcini showed that 
such physiological cell death is inhibited by soluble factors such as nerve 
growth factor2. dysregulation of cell-death programmes features in 
developmental and neoplastic disorders of the nervous system, and 
there is increasing evidence to suggest that such dysregulation may also 
occur in neurodegenerative, infectious, traumatic, ischaemic, metabolic 
and demyelinating disorders.
in 1964, lockshin and his colleagues introduced the term pro-
grammed cell death to describe the apparently predetermined pattern 
by which specific cells die during insect development3. in 1966, it was 
shown that this process requires protein synthesis, at least in some 
cases2, indicating that it is the result of an active cellular suicide process. 
then, in 1972, john kerr and his colleagues coined the term apoptosis 
to describe a morphologically relatively uniform set of cell deaths seen 
in many different situations, from development to insult response to 
cell turnover4.
although pcd has often been equated with apoptosis, non-apoptotic 
forms also exist5–9, and neurodegenerative conditions such as hunting-
ton’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) and ischaemia show 
cell deaths that do not fulfil the criteria for apoptosis7.
classical developmental studies support the view that at least three 
different forms of pcd are distinguishable (table 1): type i, also known 
as nuclear or apoptotic; type ii, also known as autophagic3,5,8; and type 
iii, also known as cytoplasmic5,6,8,10. these occur reproducibly in spe-
cific nuclei and with specific frequencies, at particular times of nerv-
ous-system development. but these cell-death pathways may also be 
activated by various insults, such as dna damage or the accumulation 
of misfolded proteins.
neurodegenerative diseases are associated with a number of insults 
that may trigger pcd: misfolded proteins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen 
species, mitochondrial-complex inhibition, calcium entry, excitotoxic-
ity, trophic-factor withdrawal, and death-receptor activation to name a 
few. in some cases, however, deaths occur that do not fit neatly into any 
of the three classes of pcd, and these more controversial forms of death 
are also discussed below.
temporal studies of neurodegenerative models suggest, however, that 
pcd may be a relatively late event in the neurodegenerative process, 
and that death is preceded by early functional alterations (for example, 
electrophysiological deficits and cellular-stress-pathway activation) and 
microanatomical deficits (such as neurite retraction and synapse loss; 
see page 768). surprisingly, then, various approaches aimed at inhibit-
ing pcd have led to improved outcomes in neurodegenerative models, 
indicating that these pathways could have an important role in neuro-
degenerative diseases. furthermore, recent studies have suggested that 
death in the nervous system may trigger stem-cell proliferation and 
survival, and so the work on cell death pathways — the subject of this 
review — offers many potential points of entry into the therapeutics of 
neurodegenerative disease states. 
classical apoptosis
apoptosis (from the greek, ‘falling away’), also referred to as nuclear 
or type i pcd, is the best-characterized type of pcd (box 1). mor-
phologically, cells typically round up, form blebs, undergo zeiosis (an 
appearance of boiling due to rapid bleb formation), chromatin conden-
sation, nuclear fragmentation and the budding off of apoptotic bodies. 
phosphatidylserine, which is usually located at the plasma membrane 
and faces inwards on live cells, now faces both inwards and outwards11. 
these morphological and histochemical changes are largely the result of 
activation of a set of cell-suicide cysteine proteases, the caspases12,13.
the biochemical activation of classical apoptosis occurs through two 
main pathways (box 1). these are the extrinsic pathway, which origi-
nates through the activation of cell-surface death receptors such as fas, 
and results in the activation of caspase-8 or -10 (ref. 14), and the intrinsic 
pathway, which originates from mitochondrial release of cytochrome c 
and associated activation of caspase-9. a third, less well-characterized 
pathway — essentially a second intrinsic pathway — originates from 
the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and also results in the activation of 
caspase-9 (refs 15–17). other organelles, such as the nucleus and golgi 
apparatus, have damage sensors that link to apoptotic pathways18.
various biochemical responders, both physiological and pathological, 
act on the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. whether triggered by dna 
damage or by sensors associated with other organelles, the typical out-
come is that the balance between pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 
family and anti-apoptotic members is shifted toward the pro-apoptotic 
members (box 1), which leads (although not invariably) to the cell’s 
demise. but both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways ulti-
mately rely on the activation of caspases for death to ensue. 
caspases are cysteine-aspartyl-specific proteases that cleave with 
remarkable specificity at a small subset of aspartic acid residues. there 
are two types of apoptotic caspase: initiators and effectors. the initiator

caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases, thereby activating 
them; effector caspases (for example, caspase-3 and 7) in turn cleave 
other protein substrates in the cell, resulting in the apoptotic process.
both type of caspase are relatively inactive (the effectors more so 
than the initiators) when first synthesized, but they differ markedly in 
terms of their activation. initiator caspases (caspase-8, 9 and 10) exist as 
monomers and bind to other proteins by means of what is known as the 
caspase activation and recruitment domain (card) in caspase-9 and a 
death effector domain (ded) in caspase-8 and 10. this protein–protein 
interaction results in dimerization of the caspases, which leads to their 
activation. contrary to earlier models, cleavage of initiator caspases is 
neither required nor sufficient for activation19. however, the effector 
caspases exist as dimers in the cell and are activated by cleavage rather 
than induced proximity. cleavage produces a tetramer with two large 
subunits and two small subunits with a substrate specificity that differs 
from initiator caspases.
the caspase substrates — the number of which is unknown but is 
probably somewhere between 0.5% and 5% of proteins — contribute to 
the apoptotic phenotype in various ways, such as by activation of pro-
teolytic cascades, inactivation of repair, dna cleavage, mitochondrial 
permeabilization and initiation of the process of phagytosis to clear up 
the dying cells, apoptotic bodies and debris.
origami meets apoptosis
misfolded proteins are constantly being produced, and for some pro-
teins such misfolded species represent a significant fraction of the 
overall output. misfolded proteins trigger a protective stress response, 
known as the unfolded-protein response (upr; fig. 1). although this 
response may put off a cellular catastrophe for a short time, prolonged 
er stress and upr activation completely overwhelm the cellular pro-
tective mechanism, ultimately resulting in the activation of suicide 
pathways20–23 (box 2). morover, misfolded proteins also aggregate as 
oligomers and higher-order multimers, both of which may interact with 
critical cellular targets such as chaperones and transcription factors, 
among others. 
these pathways are of particular interest in neurodegenerative disease 
studies because they are implicated in all the main examples of such dis-
eases24. disorders such as alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease 
(pd), huntington’s disease (hd), als and prion-protein diseases all 
share one common feature: accumulation and aggregation of misfolded 
proteins20,21 (see pages 774 and 803).
mediators of cell death induced by misfolded proteins have recently 
been identified (box 2). bcl-2 family proteins also seem to have a key 
role in the cellular-suicide decision process25, and in the communica-
tion between the er and the mitochondria. bax/bak double knockout 
cells demonstrate no caspase activation following er stress, indicating 
that these are required mediators26. bik may function to activate bax 
and bak in this pathway, whereas bi-1 inhibits bax activation and 
translocation to the er27. other bcl-2 family proteins are also involved, 
such as puma and noxa, as well as p53 (ref. 28).
rather than true protein misfolding, prion proteins may trigger pcd 
when they are in an alternative, physiologically relevant conformation29. 
the prion protein exists in three different topologies: a secreted form, 
a transmembrane form in which the amino terminus is extracellular 
(ntm), and a transmembrane form in which the carboxy terminus is 
extracellular (ctm). the latter form is pro-apoptotic and associated 
with neurodegeneration in vivo, whereas the secreted form is anti-
apoptotic. it remains to be seen whether other proteins have similar 
features.
autophagic cell death
desperate times call for desperate measures, and cells have a host of 
protective stress responses, most of which switch into execution mode 
during prolonged activation. during starvation, cells may only be able 
to survive by a process known as autophagy (from the greek, ‘self eat-
ing’). autophagy occurs in diverse organisms and is subdivided into 
macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy.  
it complements the proteasomal pathway in that long-lived proteins, 
protein aggregates, and organelles are degraded by this regulated lyso-
somal pathway of degradation (see page 780). targets for degradation 
— for example, damaged mitochondria or aggregates of misfolded 
proteins — are encircled by a process that is essentially an intracellular 
form of phagocytosis. the newly membrane-delimited structure — an 
autophagosome — then fuses with a lysosome, resulting in the degra-
dation of the contents of the autophagosome. the molecular details of 
this process have been best characterized in yeast, in which a number of 
atg (autophagy) genes have been identified, most of which have clear 
orthologues in higher eukaryotes.
because the degradation of molecules and organelles by autophagy 
results in the production of energy and amino acids for protein syn-
thesis, it is a cellular protective pathway that, although constitutively 
active at a low level, can be markedly upregulated by nutrient starvation.

after release from the mitochondria, 
cytochrome c induces conformational change 
and heptamerization of the cytosolic protein 
apaf-1. the heptamer binds caspase-9, which 
results in its activation and the cleavage of 
effector caspases such as caspase-3 and 7. 
these active caspases can still be held in 
check by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (iaps) 
such as xiap68, which may function as direct 
inhibitors of caspase activity and as e3 ligases 
that mediate caspase degradation69. this iap-
mediated block may be released by proteins 
such as smac70,71 and omi (also known as 
htra2)72, which are also released from the 
mitochondria.
fission and fusion of mitochondria73,74 
also seem to function in cell death. fission 
is mediated by drp1 and fis1, and inhibition 
of these proteins blocks the induction of 
apoptosis by staurosporine74. pro-apoptotic 
proteins may be recruited to the mitochondria 
by drp1, and mitochondrial remodelling may 
enhance the release of cytochrome c and other 
mitochondrial proteins. this could have special 
relevance to pcd during neurodegeneration, 
because mutations in the mitochondrial fusion 
mediator opa1 are associated with optic 
atrophy75,76. ongoing work should clarify the 
roles of mitochondrial fission and fusion, and 
their mediators, in pcd and neurodegeneration.
box 1 | intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways 
in the best-characterized example of the 
extrinsic pathway (panel a) fas is bound by 
the trimeric fas ligand (fasl). this results in 
the recruitment of fadd though fas’s death 
domain (dd) and caspase-8 through fadd’s 
death effector domain (ded)63. the proximity 
of the initiator caspase, which results from its 
recruitment to the trimeric fas–fadd complex, 
leads to its activation, and the subsequent 
activation of effector caspases (such as caspase-
3 and 7) by cleavage. furthermore, the extrinsic 
pathway interacts with the intrinsic pathway via 
caspase-8 cleavage of bid to produce tbid.
whereas the extrinsic pathway uses caspase-
8 (or caspase-10) to initiate cell death, the 
intrinsic pathway relies on caspase-9 (panel b). 
the propensity of cells to undergo apoptosis, 
known as the apostat, is largely determined 
by the balance between anti-apoptotic and 
pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family 
of proteins. there are three types of pro-
apoptotic bcl-2-family protein. first, the 
multidomain proteins, such as bax and bak, 
have bcl-2 homology domains 1–3 (bh1–3), 
which can permeabilize mitochondrial outer 
membranes64. second, the bh3-only proteins, 
such as bim and tbid, activate bax and bak 
and may participate in pore formation. third, 
the bh3-only derepressors such as puma, 
noxa and bad sequester the anti-apoptotic 
bcl-2 and bcl-xl (and related proteins with 
bh1–4 domains), freeing up bh1–3 proteins 
to permeabilize the mitochondria. this 
causes the release of various pro-apoptotic 
mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c 
and smac (also known as diablo), into the 
cytosol. other proteins that are unrelated to 
bcl-2 can also influence the actions of the bcl-2 
family members65–67.

nutrient withdrawal inactivates tor (target of rapamycin), activating 
an atg complex30. in a second step, vesicle nucleation occurs, and then, 
in a third step, vesicle expansion occurs, followed finally by the recy-
cling of atg proteins. the importance of this pathway in vivo has been 
illustrated by atg7 conditionally null mice31, which show various cellu-
lar abnormalities such as ubiquitin-positive aggregates and apparently 
damaged mitochondria.  furthermore, mice deficient in autophagy due 
to knockout of beclin 1 are nonviable32.
although the roles of the autophagic process in protein and organel-
lar degradation, and in cellular protection during nutrient starvation, 
are well accepted, the role of autophagy in pcd is more controver-
sial30,32,33. this is in part because the term ‘autophagic cell death’ has 
been used for two potentially distinct observations: cell death associated 
with autophagy and cell death requiring autophagy. most examples of 
autophagic cell death represent the former. however, increasing evi-
dence suggests that the autophagic process is required for at least some 
cell deaths. for example, haploinsufficiency of beclin 1 leads to a tumour 
predisposition phenotype, indicating that autophagy is tumour sup-
pressive32. more direct evidence has been provided by cells whose apop-
totic machinery has been inhibited: when mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
(mefs) that are null for both bax and bak are treated with the apoptosis 
inducers staurosporine or etoposide they undergo a form of cell death 
that is associated with autophagosomes, is dependent on atg5 and bec-
lin 1 and is inhibited by the autophagy/class iii phosphatidylinositol-3 
kinase inhibitor 3-methyladenine33.
furthermore, lenardo’s group found that caspase inhibition by 
zvad-fmk (a general caspase inhibitor) in l929 cells results in 
autophagy-dependent pcd34, which has been proposed to be mediated 
by the selective degradation of catalase35. on the one hand, this may alert 
us to the possibility that anti-apoptotic therapies carry the potential risk 
of inducing non-apoptotic pcd; on the other hand, it may argue that 
therapeutics directed at multiple cell-death pathways will be required 
for optimal efficacy in diseases that involve pcd. because cell death 
associated with some neurodegenerative diseases (or disease-associated 
mutants, such as α-synuclein) is associated with an autophagic mor-
phology, these implications are potentially important for the develop-
ment of effective therapies to prevent or ameliorate neurodegenerative 
disorders36.
it is clear that in vivo testing to establish whether the autophagic pro cess 
is required for any form(s) of pcd is needed, and the required genetic 
and pharmacological tools are increasingly available. many questions in 
this area remain unanswered. if autophagy is a cellular-protective pro-
gramme that — like the upr — at some point activates pcd, what is the 
signal that initiates pcd? how important is the role of autophagic pcd 
in neurodegeneration? does autophagic pcd occur in vivo in the absence 
of apoptosis inhibition? are there ‘executioners’ analogous to caspases 
in autophagic pcd? given the common finding of protein aggregates in 
neurodegenerative diseases, is a defect in autophagy a common underly-
ing problem in these diseases? if so, does this contribute to the triggering 
of cell death in neurodegenerative diseases?
alternative cell-death programmes
in comparison with apoptosis, little is known about autophagic pcd, 
and even less is known about other non-apoptotic forms of pcd. in fact,

figure 1 | misfolded proteins and endoplasmic-reticulum stress.  a, in addition to its role as an er chaperone protein, bip also regulates the activation of the 
three proximal er-stress transducers — ire1, perk and atf6. all three transducers contain an amino-terminal luminal domain that interacts with bip. 
under normal conditions, bip serves as a negative regulator of ire1, perk and atf6 activation. when misfolded proteins accumulate and result in er 
stress, bip binds to these proteins. bip is thus released from the transducers, which are consequently activated. the activation of all three proximal sensors 
results in reduction in the amount of new protein translocated into the er lumen, increased degradation of er-localized proteins and increased protein-
folding capacity of the er. b, bip release from perk correlates with oligomerization, trans-autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signalling 
by perk. perk-dependent phosphorylation of eif2α on ser 51 leads to attenuation of protein translation and thereby reduces the workload of the er. 
c, bip release from atf6 permits transport of aft6 to the golgi compartment for regulated intramembrane proteolysis by site-1 protease (s1p) and site-2 
protease (s2p) to generate a 50-kda cytosolic b-zip-containing fragment (atf6dc). atf6dc translocates to the nucleus to activate er-stress inducible 
target genes that code for proteins involved in protein folding. this bip-regulated activation provides a direct mechanism to sense the folding capacity of 
the er. d, accumulation of misfolded proteins in the er causes bip to release ire1. ire1 is a type i transmembrane protein that contains both a serine/
threonine kinase domain and an endoribonuclease domain; the latter processes an intron from x-box protein 1 (xbp1) mrna, rendering it competent for 
translation to produce the 41-kda xbp1(s) protein. unspliced xbp1 mrna encodes a basic leucine-zipper protein, xbp1(u), that lacks transactivation 
activity and is more labile than xbp1(s). xbp1(s) binds to the promoters of several genes involved in retrograde transport of misfolded proteins from the 
er to the cytosol and in er-induced protein degradation.
so far, other forms of pcd have not been generally accepted by the sci-
entific community. however, as has previously been noted37, such forms 
of cell death have been observed repeatedly, although their genetics and 
biochemical pathways are poorly understood. type iii pcd5, or cyto-
plasmic cell death, is a ‘necrosis-like’ form of pcd that includes swelling 
of the er and mitochondria, and lacks typical apoptotic features such 
as apoptotic bodies and nuclear fragmentation. it has recently been 
noted that the hyperactivation of the tyrosine-kinase receptor insulin-
like growth factor i receptor (igfr) induces a non-apoptotic form of 
cell death known as paraptosis9. this was shown to be programmatic 
— in that it required transcription and translation — and was found to 
be morphologically indistinguishable from type iii pcd. neither bcl-2 
nor caspase inhibitors block this form of pcd, nor are caspases acti-
vated, but inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (erk2) 
— but not erk1 — were found to inhibit paraptosis38, as was aip-1 (a 
pcd-interacting protein also known as alix).
the idea that pcd might be induced by hyperactivation of a trophic 
factor receptor — trophotoxicity — is compatible with earlier observa-
tions that some trophic factors may increase neuronal cell death, for 
example that induced by excitotoxicity39. such an effect might be pro-
tective against neoplasia, in that it may eliminate cells that would oth-
erwise undergo autocrine-loop-stimulated oncogenesis. the resulting 
programme would necessarily be non-apoptotic, because trophic factors 
inactivate apoptotic signalling. 
aponecrosis is a term applied to a combination of apoptosis and 
necrosis40. many cytotoxins induce pcd at low concentrations but at 
higher concentrations induce necrotic cell death, presumably because 
the cell’s homeostatic processes are overwhelmed before the cell-death 
programmes can be completed. in fact, this is the most common pattern 
seen with cellular toxins, from hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants 
to mitochondrial toxins such as antimycin a40. nicotera, lipton and 
their colleagues showed that glutamate-induced neuronal-cell death 
could proceed through apoptosis or necrosis, depending on mitochon-
drial membrane potential and cellular energy state41. however, in most 
cases, the necrotic morphology associated with aponecrosis has not been 
proved not to be programmed. so, it is still not clear whether aponecrosis 
represents a combination of apoptosis and a non-apoptotic form of pcd, 
or whether it represents a combination of apoptosis and non-program-
matic cell death.
forms of cell death have been described that do not fit the criteria for 
any of the three types of developmental cell death (table 1). for exam-
ple, a non-apoptotic, caspase-independent form that does not resemble 
type ii or type iii developmental pcd has been described by driscoll 
and her colleagues42 in c. elegans expressing mutant channel proteins 
such as mec-4(d). a uniform, necrosis-like cell death — characterized 
morphologically by membranous whorls not seen in other types of cell 
death — is triggered by calcium entry, mediated by specific calpains and 
cathepsins, and inhibited by calreticulin.
a fifth apparent form of pcd has been described by the dawsons and 
their colleagues, who showed that a non-apoptotic form of cell death 
depends on the activation of poly-(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) 
and the consequent translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) 
from the mitochondria to the nucleus43. aif is a flavoprotein described 
by kroemer and colleagues44 that is involved with dna fragmentation, 
along with endonuclease g and dna-fragmentation factor. this form 
of pcd was shown to be activated by agents that induce dna damage, 
and shows a morphology and biochemistry that is, as far as we know, 
distinct from pcd types i–iii.
it is likely that, as additional data are gathered from other cell-death 
paradigms, novel biochemical pathways of pcd will be characterized.

box 2 | endoplasmic-reticulum stress and cell death
er stress is coupled to specific independent death pathways, as well as 
demonstrating involvement with the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic 
pathways. studies from various laboratories have disclosed the roles of 
several er-stress-induced cell-death modulators and effectors through 
the use of biochemical, pharmacological and genetic tools. these er-
stress-induced cell-death modulators include various members of the 
bcl-2 family (bcl-2, bcl-xl, bax, bak, bi-1 and bik), bap31 and p53-
dependent gene products such as noxa and puma.
bap31, an er-membrane protein, binds bcl-2 (or bcl-xl) and a caspase-
8-containing pro-apoptotic complex77. when bap31 is cleaved, a pro-
apoptotic p20 fragment is derived, which, among other effects, induces 
mitochondrial fission, enhancing cytochrome c release78. conversely, 
bar, which is expressed primarily in neurons of the central nervous 
system, also bridges bcl-2 and caspase-8 but functions as an anti-
apoptotic protein79.
chop (also known as gadd153), a transcription factor induced during 
er stress and activated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, may 
also function as an er-stress-induced cell-death modulator. it has been 
proposed to promote er-stress-induced cell death by downregulating 
bcl-2 expression.
recent data have also implicated the calcium-binding protein 
apoptosis-linked gene-2 (alg-2), and valosin-containing protein (vcp) 
as mediators of er-stress-induced pcd. p23 interacts with puma and 
inhibits apoptosis, an effect that is reversed after cleavage. an alg-2-
interacting protein known as alix (or aip-1) links motor-neuron-cell 
death during development as well as neuronal death in a hd model to the 
endolysosomal system80. 
in addition to the two main pathways that initiate the caspase cascade 
— namely, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways — some studies point 
for example, there is an extensive literature on the morphological crite-
ria for another potential form of pcd — oncosis — but the biochemical 
underpinnings of oncosis have not yet been described. oncosis refers to 
a specific morphology of cell death — cellular swelling — that is typically 
induced by ischaemia and is thought to be mediated by the failure of 
plasma-membrane ionic pumps. one potential mediator of oncosis is a 
calpain-family protease (possibly a mitochondrial calpain45).
triggering cell death in neurodegeneration
as noted above, a number of different and potentially interrelated 
insults may occur as part of the neurodegenerative process. the role of 
the cell-death machinery in neurodegenerative diseases is controversial,

to a caspase-12-mediated apoptotic pathway that involves the er and 
the upr (at least in murine cells), although this is a controversial area 
of research. caspase-12 may be activated by calpain or caspase-7, or by 
er-stress-activated ire1, which may recruit caspase-12 through tumour-
necrosis-factor receptor-associated factor 2 protein (traf2). 
oligomerized ire1 also binds traf2, signalling downstream kinases 
(ask1 and jnk) that, in turn, cause activation of pro-apoptotic proteins 
and cell death.

especially because synaptic loss and electrophysiological abnormalities 
typically precede cell loss in these disease states (see page 768). however, 
recent studies suggest a critical role for cell-death mediators in neuro-
degenerative diseases, even before the reduction in neuronal number. 
for example, in a transgenic mouse model of ad that features senile 
plaques, synapse and memory loss, but little or no neuronal loss, muta-
tion of the caspase cleavage site at asp 664 in the amyloid precursor pro-
tein (app) completely suppressed synapse loss, dentate gyral atrophy, 
astrogliosis and memory loss, even though senile plaque number and 
amyloid-β concentrations were unaffected46. in an analogous study with 
an hd-transgenic mouse model, mutation of the caspase-6 site (but not 
the caspase-3 sites) in polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin prevented 
both the neurodegeneration and motor abnormalities characteristic of 
huntington’s disease47.
more direct evidence for caspase activation in neurodegeneration 
(fig. 2) comes from the employment of antibodies directed against 
neo-epitopes derived by caspase cleavage46,48 and from the inhibition 
of neurodegeneration by caspase inhibitors49,50. however, some neuro-
degenerative models and diseases clearly demonstrate non-apoptotic 
forms of pcd7. determining which pcd pathways are triggered in each 
neurodegenerative disease, which pathway accounts for each fraction 
of cell death, the mechanism(s) by which each pathway is triggered, and 
the interactions between the various pathways should shed new light 
on the degenerative process and its potential treatment or prevention. 
perhaps even more important will be dissecting the pathways mediating 
sub apoptotic events such as synaptosis and wallerian degeneration — 
likely to be important features in the neurodegenerative process — and 
understanding how the interplay between these various processes results 
in the neurodegenerative phenotype.
the ability to initiate the neurodegenerative process, with widely 
varying insults — from misfolded proteins to reactive oxygen species 
to caspase recruitment complexes, as well as other mechanisms — and 
yet produce a relatively small number of syndromes indicates the exist-
ence of a death network that can be entered from many different sites 
but once triggered follows similar interdependent biochemical pathways 
with little dependence on the point of entry. this idea is compatible with

the findings that therapeutics aimed at different pathways (for example, 
caspase activation, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, metal binding 
and reactive-oxygen-species scavenging) all have partly salutary effects. 
however, it also suggests that a complete halt of the neurodegenerative 
process may require therapeutics that address all the interacting path-
ways of the network.
targeting programmed cell death
neuronal loss is a relatively late event in neurodegenerative diseases, 
following neuronal dysfunction, synapse loss and, often, somal atrophy. 
but targeting pcd has been successful in at least some model systems of 
neurodegeneration, and it is possible that targeting multiple pcd path-
ways will be even more effective. caspase inhibition in vivo retarded the 
degeneration in transgenic mouse models of both als and hd, despite 
the fact that the morphological description of neuronal cell death in 
these diseases is not compatible with apoptosis49,50. bcl-2 expression 
in a transgenic model of als delayed symptom onset and increased 
lifespan, but did not alter the disease duration51.
minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline that inhibits mitochon-
drial cytochrome c release, effected neuroprotection in mouse models 
of hd, pd and als52. minocycline is orally bioavailable, penetrates 
the blood–brain barrier and has been proved safe for use in humans. 
it is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with hd and 
als52.
rasagiline, which has been approved for the treatment of pd, has also 
been proposed to target apoptosis, but because it is a potent, selective, 
irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type b, its therapeutic effect 
on pd may have nothing to do with effects on apoptosis.
trophic factors have multiple effects, including the inhibition of apop-
tosis, the stimulation of neural precursors and the stimulation of neurite 
outgrowth. the literature is rife with examples of trophic-factor ther-
apy for various neurological conditions, and although many have been 
unsuccessful, the delivery of the correct factor(s) to the right target in the 
correct concentration for a particular disease still holds great promise 
(although hyperactivation of at least some trophic-factor receptors may 
induce pcd). a recent study of fibroblast growth factor 2 (fgf2) in 
a mouse model of hd prolonged survival, improved motor perform-
ance and reduced polyglutamine aggregates53. a number of approaches 
have been taken to deliver nerve growth factor (ngf) to patients with 
ad, the most recent being by means of genetically engineered fibrob-
lasts in a phase i trial54. in this study, improvements in cognition and 
positron-emission tomography (used to monitor fluorodeoxyglucose 
uptake) were documented. glial-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) 
has shown promise in the treatment of pd55.
hd may represent one of the best possibilities for trophic-factor 
therapy: presymptomatic diagnosis is readily available, and although 
a number of different trophic factors have shown promise in animal 
models (for example, fgf2, ngf and ciliary neurotrophic factor56), 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) is both reduced in the disease 
and therapeutic in models. furthermore, cysteamine has been shown to 
increase bdnf levels in brain57.
a lifeline 
exciting recent evidence suggests that pathological processes may 
stimulate neurogenesis in the brain and may redirect the migration 
of nascent neurons towards the site of pathology. and, under certain 
circumstances, stimulating neurogenesis can improve the performance 
and survival of mice with neurodegenerative disease. these and similar 
results raise the question of whether stem-cell exhaustion or senescence 
after prolonged stimulation might have a role in the long-term course of 
neurodegenerative disease. furthermore, although the factors linking 
neurodegeneration to neural-stem-cell proliferation and inhibition of 
pcd are largely unknown, the potential for therapy using these putative 
factors is likely to be significant. reconciliation of cell-death pathways 
with neurodegenerative and regenerative mechanisms should offer an 
improved understanding of disease and open avenues for therapeutic 
intervention.
