abstract
the protein l-isoaspartyl-o-methyltransferase, coded by the pcm-1 gene in caenorhabditis elegans, participates in the repair of age-damaged
proteins. we tested the ability of pcm-1-deficient nematodes to survive starvation stress as developmentally-arrested l1 larvae. we found that
pcm-1 mutant l1 larvae do not survive as well as wild-type l1 larvae when incubated in m9 medium without nutrients. we then tested
whether the starved l1 larvae could continue development when allowed access to food in a recovery assay. a loss of recovery ability with age
was observed for all larvae, with little or no difference between the pcm-1 mutant and wild-type n2 larvae. interestingly, when l1 larvae were
starved in cholesterol-containing s medium or m9 medium supplemented with cholesterol, the survival rates of both mutant and wild-type animals
nearly doubles, with pcm-1 larvae again faring more poorly than n2 larvae. furthermore, l1 larvae cultured in these cholesterol-containing media
show an increase in sudan black staining over animals cultured in m9 medium. the longevity defects of pcm-1 mutants previously seen in dauer
larvae and here in l1 larvae suggest a defect in the ability of pcm-1 mutants to recycle and reuse old cellular components in pathways such as
autophagy. using an autophagosomal marker, we found evidence suggesting that the pcm-1 mutation may inhibit autophagy during dauer
formation, suggesting that the absence of protein repair may also interfere with protein degradation pathways.

introduction
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal system for
the study of aging. many studies have been done on mutants
that alter adult life span (kenyon et al., 1993; morris et al.,
1996). there are a large number of genes that regulate adult life
span in c. elegans, including 95 where mutations extend life
span and 11 where mutations decrease life span (sage ke
gene database; http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/genesdb).
additionally, some 100 new candidate longevity genes have
been recently identified by rnai screens (hamilton et al.,
2005; hansen et al., 2005; lee, 2006). c. elegans can also
survive for extended periods of time as l1 and dauer larvae,
which can be as long-lived as or longer-lived than the adult

stage (múnoz and riddle, 2003; larsen et al., 1995). there are
sets of genes where mutations affect both dauer and l1 larval
survival but not adult survival, while there are other genes
where mutations affect all three stages (múnoz and riddle,
2003). in this study, we describe a mutation in a c. elegans gene
that has no effect on adult aging but that does affect aging in the
l1 and dauer stages.
the isolated mutation affects the protein l-isoaspartyl-o-
methyltransferase gene, pcm-1. this protein repair methyl-
transferase has been conserved through evolution and enzymes
from prokaryotes and eukaryotes share a high degree of
sequence similarity (kagan et al., 1997a). proteins are targets
for a number of inappropriate spontaneous covalent modifica-
tions that can lead to decreased or aberrant protein function
(clarke, 2003). l-aspartic acid and l-asparagine residues are
particularly susceptible to these undesirable reactions, forming
l-isoaspartyl, d-aspartyl, or d-isoaspartyl residues (brennan and
clarke, 1995). the protein l-isoaspartyl-o-methyltransferase
494

can initiate the conversion of l-isoaspartyl residues to l-aspartyl
residues and may reduce the content of d-aspartyl residues as
well (chavous et al., 2001; doyle et al., 2003; ingrosso et al.,
2000; lanthier and desrosiers, 2004; young et al., 2001).
in c. elegans, pcm-1-mutant animals are similar to the wild-
type n2 animals in morphology, fertility, and adult life span
(kagan et al., 1997b; banfield, 2004). interestingly, the absence
of the enzyme does not appear to cause a marked accumulation
of damaged proteins (niewmierzycka and clarke, 1999). the
pcm-1-null animals have two phenotypes: they are selected
against in long-term competitive population studies and they
have a reduced dauer life span (kagan et al., 1997b).
recently, it was shown that c. elegans with mutations in
genes involved in autophagy had dauer-defective phenotypes
(melendez et al., 2003). autophagy is the major degradative
pathway for long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles, and
may be important for survival under starvation and stress
conditions (levine and klionsky, 2004).
here, we show that l1 larvae, when forced to use their
existing stores of energy, do not survive as well without the
repair methyltransferase, which suggests that protein repair may
be important in autophagy. in addition, we found that both the
wild-type and pcm-1-deficient l1 larvae survive longer during
starvation when cholesterol was present in the media. it is known
that exogenous sterols are necessary for the growth, develop-
ment, and reproduction of c. elegans (hieb and rothstein, 1968;
shim et al., 2002), but the role of sterols in resistance to
starvation has not been previously established. we demonstrate
an increase in sudan black staining of animals maintained in
cholesterol-containing media in comparison to non-supplemen-
ted media, indicating potential increases in fat stores in the
presence of cholesterol. finally, we found that autophagosomal
bodies, as measured by the lgg-1∷gfp autophagosome
marker, accumulate as l2d larvae approach the dauer molt and
that the pcm-1 mutation interferes with this process.

results
pcm-1-delete l1 larvae show survival defects during starvation
stress
to test the importance of the pcm-1 encoded l-isoaspartyl-
longevity, we prepared
o-methyltransferase in l1 larval
synchronous cultures of mutant pcm-1(qa201) and wild-type
n2 larvae and assayed for survival in various media without
food. larvae were cultured at a density that would otherwise
promote growth, provided there was a food source. as expected
(johnson et al., 1984; múnoz and riddle, 2003), larvae in these
experiments did not develop beyond the first l1 larval stage
(data not shown). using a movement assay to distinguish alive
from dead animals, we found that pcm-1 deficient larvae did not
survive as well as the wild-type l1 larvae in either minimal m9
medium, a cholesterol and trace metal-containing s medium, or

20 °c in various media. panels a–c show n2 (open diamonds) and pcm-1
(qa201) (closed circles) in m9 medium (a), s medium (b), and m9 medium

n2 and pcm-1(qa201) l1 larvae in m9+ cholesterol along with the additional
mutant allele strain pcm-1(tm363) (d). survival was measured by assaying
motility or the ability to move in response to touch. error bars represent the
standard deviation of three replicate samples from each culture medium. all
experiments were repeated at least once and showed similar results. asterisks

in m9 medium containing cholesterol (fig. 1; supplemental
table s1, supplemental table s2). in three experiments, the
average median survival time decreased from the n2 to the
pcm-1 mutant strain from 11.8 days to 10.8 days in m9
medium, from 22.9 to 18.3 days in s medium, and from 30.7 to
27.9 days in cholesterol-containing m9 medium (supplemental
table s2). similar decreases were found in maximal survival
time for pcm-1 compared to n2 l1 larvae (fig. 1; supplemental
table s2). the overall difference in survival between the mutant
and wild-type strains were found to be significant at the level of
p < 0.05 in seven of the eight cases where a direct comparison
could be made (supplemental table s2). pcm-1 deficient larvae
also showed a decrease in mobility with time; they migrated less
efficiently than the n2 larvae to the bacterial lawn after 7 days
and only moved in response to touch stimulus more often than
the n2 l1 larvae.
the pcm-1 gene overlaps a gene of unknown function,
c10f3.4, in an antiparallel arrangement. because the pcm-1
(qa201) deletion removes potential promoter elements and an
alternatively-spliced exon from the c10f3.4 gene, we con-
firmed the l1 longevity defects in an independent pcm-1(tm363)
deletion mutant that only removes intronic portions of c10f3.4.
the pcm-1(tm363) survival curve is nearly identical to the pcm-
1(qa201) survival curve, suggesting that the l1 survival defect is
due to the specific disruption of the pcm-1 gene (fig. 1d).
l1 larvae survive longer in culture media containing
cholesterol
m9 minimal medium lacks cholesterol, a molecule essential
for growth (hieb and rothstein, 1968). we found that the
survival of both n2 and pcm-1 deficient l1 larvae was greatly
reduced in this medium compared to m9 medium supplemented
with cholesterol or cholesterol-containing s-medium (fig. 1;
supplemental table s2). mean survival was extended from 11–
12 days in the cholesterol-deficient m9 medium to 18–31 days
in the two cholesterol-containing media, and maximal survival
similarly increased from 17–19 days to 29–49 days (supple-
mental table s2, p < 0.02). l1 larvae grown in both of the
cholesterol-containing media also appeared to be more active
than animals grown in m9 medium, showing increased mobility
and appearing to thrash more rapidly.
the ability to recover from l1 arrest decreases as the larvae age
in addition to scoring survival by the movement assay (fig.
1), the ability of the same starved l1 larvae to develop when
food was presented was also measured (fig. 2; supplemental
table s3). here, we considered the possibility that some larvae
that were alive by the movement assay might not be able to
recover and go on the developmental pathway towards
adulthood. we thus asked what fraction of the larvae judged
to be initially alive on the plates could migrate to the bacterial
lawn and proceed to at least the l2 larval stage within 48 h. no
recovery was seen from animals originally scored as dead. most
recovered animals developed to the l4 or young adult stage. we
observed no dead larvae beyond the l1 stage, suggesting that no
fig. 2. ability of l1 larvae to recover after incubations under starvation conditions.
starved l1 larvae were placed on op50-seeded, ngm plates at various ages and
incubated at 20 °c for 2 days. recovery was defined as the ability to exit l1 arrest
and is expressed as a percentage of the number of animals originally scored as
alive. results are shown for m9 (a), s medium (b) and m9 medium with
cholesterol (c). asterisks denote a p-value less than 0.05 when pcm-1 is compared
to n2. the values given represent the average percent recovery for samples in
which the number of l1 larvae scored alive on the plates was greater than 15. the
error represents the standard deviation of three replicate plates.
differential mortality occurred. for animals incubated in m9
medium, we found a rapid loss of the ability to recover after
10 days with the pcm-1 mutant larvae doing as well or more
poorly than the n2 wild-type larvae at each time point (fig. 2a).
a similar situation was found in s medium or m9 medium with
cholesterol (figs. 2b and c, supplemental table s3). these
results suggest that the loss of protein repair has little to no
effect on their ability to move and utilize food sources when
they become available. it is clear that as l1 larvae age, their
ability to mature to late larval stages dramatically decreases
despite their ability to survive to that age. overall, the recovery
data and the survival data show a compounded decrease with
time in the ability of animals to overcome l1 starvation.

size, morphology, and sudan black staining of n2 and pcm-1
l1 larvae
autophagy defects in pcm-1 mutant l2d larvae
we confirmed by microscopy that pcm-1 mutant and wild-
type animals grown in m9 medium and cholesterol-containing
media did not develop past the l1 larval stage (supplemental
fig. s1). at day 1, after hatching overnight without food, the
larvae measured approximately 220–240 μm in length. the
larvae remained in this range over the course of the life span
studies in all tested media (data not shown; byerly et al., 1976).
these measurements also show that the pcm-1-mutant larvae
are initially larger than n2 larvae; they are wider by 1.2 to
1.7 μm and longer by about 16 to 17 μm at day 1 (table 1). at
later times of incubation, however, no difference was seen.
when live l1 larvae were examined under high magnifica-
tion, animals incubated in cholesterol-containing media were
found to be distinct from those incubated in m9 medium
(supplemental fig. s1, panels a, e). the animals cultured in
cholesterol-supplemented media appeared denser and darker
with an accumulation of dark spots and granules in the head and
body (supplemental fig. s1). no obvious differences were
observed between the morphology of pcm-1 l1 animals and n2
l1 animals cultured in any media.
the granules noted in the l1 microscopy appeared similar to
those characteristic of dauer larvae that stain with sudan black
dye (kimura et al., 1997; cassada and russell, 1975; ogg et al.,
1997; wolkow et al., 2000). sudan black stains cholesterol
esters, triglycerides, and to a lesser extent, phospholipids and
free fatty acids (bayliss high, 1981). sudan black does not
normally stain cholesterol because it is usually found in a
crystalline state in normal cells and is impenetrable to sudan
dyes (bayliss high, 1981). wild-type animals had little to no
staining after hatching (fig. 3, panel a) and continued to have
low staining when cultured in m9 medium (fig. 3, panels b, e,
h). animals cultured in cholesterol-containing media, however,
dramatically accumulated staining from hatching to day 12 (fig.
3, panels c, d, f, g, i, j). in cholesterol-containing media, the
appearance of the larvae was darkened overall with stained
granules out of the focal plane contributing to the intensity
observed. the pcm-1 mutant's staining pattern was similar to
that of n2 (data not shown). these results suggest that the
presence of cholesterol in the medium induces the formation of
fat granules for energy storage.

the engulfment of cytosol and
utilization is autophagy,
organelles in autophagosomes for energy-generating catabolism
and reshaping protein makeup. autophagy has been shown to
be important in temperature-induced dauer larvae formation in
the dauer constitutive mutant (daf-c), daf-2 (melendez et al.,
2003). since pcm-1 larvae have l1 and dauer larvae survival
defects (kagan et al., 1997b), we hypothesized that pcm-1
animals may have autophagy defects that affect survival in both
the l1 larval stage and the dauer larval stage.
to observe autophagosomes, we monitored the fluorescence
of a gfp-lgg-1 fusion protein in transgenic animals
(melendez et al., 2003). the worm lgg-1 protein is the
ortholog of the yeast atg8 and rat lc3 proteins that associate
with autophagosomal membranes and have been used as fusion
protein-based markers (kabeya et al., 2000; kirisako et al.,
1999; melendez et al., 2003; mizushima, 2000). autophago-
somes in transgenic gfp∷lgg-1 worms have been quantified
as punctate gfp positive areas in seam cells (melendez et al.,
2003). we examined wild-type and pcm-1 deficient l2d larvae
at 48, 52 and 56 h after egg fertilization on dauer-inducing
pheromone plates (fig. 4a). these time points span the 12 h of
development before the l2d larvae molts to become a dauer
larva. the diffuse fluorescence seen throughout the seam cells at
48 h becomes distinctly punctate at 56 h. after 48 h of
development, both n2 and pcm-1 mutant larvae exhibit a low
number of autophagosomes as measured by the gfp signal. at
52 h of development, the diffuse dispersion of the fluorescent
marker becomes more concentrated in small areas, and after
56 h little diffuse spreading of fluorescence is seen (fig. 4a).
although these changes were seen in both the n2 and pcm-1
the pcm-1 mutant has fewer gfp∷lgg-1
mutant
positive areas at all time points (fig. 4a). quantitation of the
number of fluorescent punctate spots showed that n2 larval
seam cells have a maximum of 30 gfp areas/seam cell, while
pcm-1 mutant l2d larvae have a maximum of 14 gfp areas/
seam cell (fig. 4b). at 52 h of development, n2 l2d larvae
have an average of 6.2 gfp areas/seam cell, while pcm-1 larvae
have an average of only 2.0 gfp areas/seam cell (fig. 4c).
these results suggest a defect in autophagy in animals lacking
the pcm-1 repair methyltransferase, although we cannot rule out
the possibilities that the pcm-1 mutation can affect the behavior
of the lgg-1 marker protein.

discussion
this study highlights the importance of the protein repair
l-isoaspartyl-o-methyltransferase in stress survival in nema-
todes. the decrease in the survival of l1 larvae during starvation
parallels the decrease in life span of pcm-1-deficient dauer larvae
and is consistent with the loss of mutant animals in long-term
competitive growth experiments (kagan et al., 1997b). these
results in nematodes are similar to those found in previous
studies in bacteria, where the deletion of this methyltransferase

in escherichia coli causes the most dramatic effects only when
the organism is under survival stress (visick et al., 1998).
an important finding in this study is that l1 larval life span is
nearly doubled when cholesterol is added to the media for both
mutant and wild-type animals. it is well known that free-living
nematodes have a dietary sterol requirement for growth,
development, and reproduction (hieb and rothstein, 1968; lu
et al., 1977; shim et al., 2002). the dietary requirement for
cholesterol is absolute, but the amount required for growth and
reproduction is very low (merris et al., 2003), suggesting that its
effects are not due to changes in membrane structure (chitwood,
1999; kurzchalia and ward, 2003). cholesterol does function as
a precursor to the steroid hormones involved in endocrine
signaling (entchev and kurzchalia, 2005; motola et al., 2006;
rottiers et al., 2006). in c. elegans, reproductive growth as
opposed to dauer formation is dependent upon steroids whose
biosynthesis is catalyzed by the daf-9 and daf-36 gene products
and that become ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor
encoded by the daf-12 gene (entchev and kurzchalia, 2005;
motola et al., 2006; rottiers et al., 2006). c. elegans also make
the unusual modification of cholesterol via methylation at
the 4th ring position (kurzchalia and ward, 2003; merris et
al., 2003). the presence of unique biosynthetic enzymes in
c. elegans indicates the possibility of novel cholesterol derived
hormones and developmental effectors (entchev and kurzcha-
lia, 2005; kurzchalia and ward, 2003; merris et al., 2003).
a previous report showed that “cholegans”, a transgenic
cholesterol-producing c. elegans strain has an extended adult
life-span in comparison to wild-type animals (lee et al., 2005).
the authors also showed that cholegans has a survival
advantage under heat and uv stress, leading them to conclude
that cholesterol confers longevity by helping animals resist
stress. those findings are in line with the current findings in this
study where l1 larval survival is diminished when cholesterol is
not supplemented.
in the dauer larval stage, animals rely on fat stores for survival
(kimura et al., 1997), which can be seen as a dark accumulation
of granules in the animal and can be observed directly by sudan
black staining (cassada and russell, 1975; ogg et al., 1997;
wolkow et al., 2000). the correlation seen here of longer life

kolmogorov–smirnov statistical approach to show statistical significance (p = 0.009) for equality of distributions in the distributions of gfp::lgg-1 positive areas/
seam cell in n2 and pcm-1 larvae. this experiment was replicated on two separate populations and similar results were gathered.
with increased sudan black staining in l1 larvae cultured in
cholesterol-containing media versus m9 media suggests that
similar fat storage may also be important in l1 survival.
this study provides evidence that the repair methyltransfer-
ase may function in survival by ensuring the efficient use of the
organism's cellular components. when the newly hatched
larvae are put under starvation stress, it forces the animals to
depend solely on their initial internal resources. the decreased
survival of the newly hatched pcm-1-mutant
larvae under
starvation stress indicates that the animals may have an inability
to recycle their existing cellular components. due to the
accumulation of isomerized proteins,
the methyltransferase-
delete animals may be unable to properly degrade and reuse
these proteins to make other components necessary for survival.
protein repair and degradation can thus represent parallel
pathways for the regeneration of stress-damaged proteins. we
were interested to find a defect in this study in autophagosome
formation in pcm-1 deficient l2d larvae during dauer formation,
suggesting that protein repair might be needed to allow protein
turnover. the exact defect or defects responsible for this mutant
phenotype is unknown; perhaps the presence of unrepaired
isoaspartyl-containing proteins or peptides inhibits one or more
of the degradation reactions in autophagy. in conclusion, it is
possible that pcm-1 not only affects protein repair but also
directly or indirectly protein degradation and recycling.
in mammals, the loss of the repair methyltransferase results
in more severe phenotypes. pcmt−/− mice have seizures
resulting in early death (kim et al., 1999) that have not been
seen in pcm-1 mutants of c. elegans. one possible explanation
is that
there may be more functional redundancy in the
pathways for removing age-damaged proteins either by repair
or degradation to amino acids in worms. we note that there is a
homolog of the pcm-1 gene in c. elegans (r119.5) that may
also bind damaged l-isoaspartyl residues, although there is no
evidence that it is a repair methyltransferase. in mammals,
where preserving post-translational modifications such as those
t.a. gomez et al. / developmental biology 303 (2007) 493–500
499
that may lead to memory and learning is important, the repair
pathway may be allowed to predominate over degradation
pathways (clarke, 2003). on the other hand, nematodes may
have very active proteolytic pathways that work in conjunction
with the repair process and that may largely mask the loss of
repair (niewmierzycka and clarke, 1999). the autophagy
phenotype observed here may come from the intersection of the
repair and proteolytic pathways.
