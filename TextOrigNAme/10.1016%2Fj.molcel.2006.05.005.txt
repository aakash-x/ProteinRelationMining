autophagy by arf: a short story
in this issue of molecular cell, reef et al. (2006) de-
scribe a shortened unstable form of the arf tumor
suppressor protein that localizes within mitochondria,
where it reduces membrane potential and triggers au-
tophagy. could this account for the mdm2- and p53-in-
dependent tumor suppressive effects of arf?
the mouse p19arf tumor suppressor (p14arf in hu-
mans) initiates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and en-
hances apoptosis triggered by collateral cell death-pro-
moting signals. arf is induced by increased and
sustained mitogenic stimuli conveyed by oncogenes,
but not directly by dna damage. the arf protein accu-
mulates within the nucleolus where it forms stable com-
plexes with nucleophosmin (npm/b23), but a minor
fraction associates separately with mdm2 to antagonize
its functions and provoke a robust p53 transcriptional
response (sherr et al., 2005). because mice without
functional arf, mdm2, and p53 genes are much more
tumor prone than those lacking both mdm2 and p53,
p19arf must also have mdm2- and p53-independent tu-
mor suppressive functions (weber et al., 2000). inhibi-
tion of ribosomal biogenesis, antagonism of transcrip-
tional activation by myc, e2f-1, and nfkb, and
promotion of protein sumoylation have each been in-
voked to explain p53-independent effects of p19arf
(sherr et al., 2005). a provocative report in this issue of
molecular cell now points to a novel p53-independent
activity of a variant arf protein.
reef et al. (2006) provide evidence that a short form of
the arf protein is translationally initiated from the single
internal methionine codon within both mouse and hu-
man arf mrna (met45 in p19arf [figure 1] and met48
in p14arf). mutation of the canonical p19arf initiation
codon (met1) or deletion of sequences encoding arf’s
40 n-terminal amino acids led to increased production
of these variants, which were localized by immunoﬂuo-
rescence staining to mitochondria. cell fractionation
revealed that these ‘‘short mitochondrial’’ (sm) arf spe-
cies, like cytochrome c, were conﬁned within the organ-
elle and were resistant to attack by added proteinase k,
whereas two surface mitochondrial proteins, bcl-xl and
bcl-2, were unprotected and proteolyzed. production of
nucleolar and mitochondrial forms of arf are transcrip-
tionally coregulated in response to oncogenes, but full-
length p19arf (half-life 6–8 hr) is much more stable than
smarf (half-life <1 hr), which comprises only a small
fraction (1%–5%) of the total arf protein normally de-
importantly, smarf lacks all p19arf
tected in vivo.
n-terminal sequences that direct its nucleolar localiza-
tion, confer stable binding to mdm2 and npm, retard
rrna processing, and trigger p53-dependent cell cycle
arrest. so what, if any, is its function?
after enforced expression of smarf in both human
and mouse cells, mitochondria underwent abnormal
morphologic alterations,
their membrane potential
(djm) was dissipated, and the transfected cells eventu-
ally died. these effects were observed in mouse embryo
ﬁbroblasts (mefs) lacking functional p53 or the proa-
poptotic mitochondrial proteins bax and bak and were
not circumvented by overexpressing the antiapoptotic
factors bcl-2 and bcl-xl. moreover, smarf did not
trigger cytochrome c release from mitochondria or
cleavage of parp-1 and caspase-3, all hallmarks of ap-
optosis. instead, smarf was found to stimulate auto-
phagy, a process triggered by nutrient starvation in which
cells derive energy by digesting their own components,
including organelles such as mitochondria (gozuacik
and kimchi, 2004; kondo et al., 2005). reduced djm
was detected within 24 hr of enforced smarf expres-
sion, after which autophagic vesicles accumulated.
the timing ﬁts with observations that enforced expres-
sion of p19arf can arrest the outgrowth of p53-null
mefs, but only after a signiﬁcant delay (carnero et al.,
2000; weber et al., 2000). plasmids encoding short-hair-
pin rnas directed to atg5 and beclin-1, two key regu-
lators of autophagosome formation, attenuated smarf-
induced cell death. so, although autophagy can protect
cells from stress, in this case, it appears to promote their
demise.
reef and colleagues speculate that the two arf iso-
forms activate different tumor suppressor pathways:
the ﬁrst involving a rapid, p53-induced nuclear re-
sponse, and the second utilizing a slowly evolving, mito-
chondrial-based autophagy program that gains primacy
when p53 is dysfunctional. however, these interpreta-
tions largely rely on smarf overexpression.
numerous questions arise from this work. how does
the single internal atg codon within arf mrna enable
previews

figure 1. generation and composition of smarf
the top schematic deﬁnes the position of arf exon-1b (e1b),
located midway between the ink4b and ink4a genes. the latter
two genes encode polypeptide inhibitors (p15ink4b and p16ink4a) of
cyclin d-dependent kinases. arrows indicate the positions of the
arf and the two ink4 promoters. mouse arf mrna, comprised
of spliced products of three exons (e1b, e2, and e3 as shown),
yields a 169 amino acid protein (bottom) containing >20% arginine
residues (denoted by white bars). (e2 sequences within an alterna-
tively spliced ink4a transcript [e1a, e2, and e3] are translated in
a different reading frame to yield part of p16ink4a.) residues 1–37
of p19arf are necessary and sufﬁcient for mdm2 binding and nucle-
olar import. internal initiation of translation at methionine (m) 45
yields the smarf product.
initiation of translation? the argument that smarf is not
derived via proteolytic processing of full-length p19arf
stems principally from observations that in vitro transla-
tion of the two proteins occurs simultaneously, whereas
mutation of met45 cancels smarf accumulation, both
in vitro and in vivo. there is no internal met codon in
the rat arf gene, and yet paradoxically, expression of
the rat arf cdna also yielded a shortened form of the
protein that was detected when proteasomes were in-
hibited. hence, in the rat, smarf must be generated in
a different manner.
why is smarf unstable? although met1 in p19arf is
removed by methionine aminopeptidase and the penul-
timate glycyl amino group remains unblocked and is
subsequently polyubiquitinated, sequence consider-
ations predict that met45 in smarf should be retained
and undergo cotranslational acetylation (kuo et al.,
2004). although smarf is highly basic (>20% arginine,
see figure 1), it lacks lysine residues, so no free amino
groups would be available for ubiquitination. misfolded
proteins that result from errors in translation are rapidly
degraded even if not polyubiquitinated, and when cells
are treated with proteasome inhibitors, they accumulate
(goldberg, 2003). unlike p19arf, which is stabilized
through interactions with npm (kuo et al., 2004), basic
smarf is degraded quickly by the proteasome, possibly
because it remains unstructured. how,
then, does
smarf ﬁnd its way to mitochondria, and how can it exert
slowly evolving phenotypic effects that lead to autopha-
gy and cell death? how does smarf avoid atp-depen-
dent degradation by quality control protease complexes
in mitochondria (suzuki et al., 1997)? with what proteins
within the mitochondria does smarf interact, and is this
intramitochondrial fraction stabilized in situ?
the key issue will be to determine through further ge-
netic analyses, ideally by use of mouse knockin models,
the extent to which full-length or smarf proteins alone
protect against oncogene-induced cancer develop-
ment. would a mutant arf gene incapable of generating
smarf retain p53-independent
tumor suppressive
functions? would mice lacking p53 and mdm2 and engi-
neered to produce only smarf be less tumor prone than
animals lacking all three genes?
in short, arf continues to surprise.
