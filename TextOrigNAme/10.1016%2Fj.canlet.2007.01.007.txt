abstract
autophagy is a regulated lysosomal pathway involving the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents, and is an emerging
attractive therapeutic approach for treating cancers. in the present study, we demonstrates that bromovanin (6-bromine-5-
hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde), a vanillin derivative, exhibits a potent antiproliferative eﬀect on a broad spectrum of can-
cer cell lines, but it induces apoptosis with a large variation in extent on diﬀerent cancer cell lines. ultrastructural observation in
transmission electron microscopy reveals that autophagy is another type of cell death induced by bromovanin in hepg2 cells.
treatment with bromovanin signiﬁcantly increases cellular ros level as well as elicits dna double-strand breaks as indicated
by comet assay and the increased phosphorylated h2ax. cleavage and inactivation of dna-pkcs induced by bromovanin is
found to occur concurrently with a rapid destruction of c-myc oncoprotein. these multiple eﬀects of bromovanin, especially
the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy, make it very appealing for the development as a novel anticancer drug.

variety of chemical and physical agents [1–5]. recent-
ly, vanillin was shown to suppress the invasion and
migration of cancer cells in vitro, and to inhibit the
metastasis of mouse breast cancer cells in vivo [6].
in addition, vanillin or its derivatives was shown to
inhibit the activity of dna-dependent protein kinase
catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs), a key component
involving in the non-homologous end joining
(nhej) pathway of dna double-strand breaks,
and sensitize cancer cells to genotoxic agents [7–9].

not only a valid approach to increase the tumor cell
killing of other anticancer agents, e.g., cisplatin,
top ii poisons and ionizing radiation [10–13], but
also led to down regulation of proto-oncogene c-
myc protein as well as some genes associating with
survival, proliferation and invasion, e.g., death-asso-
ciated protein kinase 3 (dapk3), the nuclear factor
of activated t cells
family members
nfatc1 and nfatc3 [12,13]. depressing dna-
pkcs also conferred the up-regulation of n-myc
downstream regulated gene 1 (ndrg1), cdkn1b
(p27/kip1), cdkn1a (p21/cip1) and some interfer-
on signaling pathway components [13].
(nfat)
although vanillin has been shown to have
the eﬀects of antiproliferation and inactivating
dna-pkcs, its potency is relatively weak. indeed, a
vanillin derivative, 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzalde-
hyde (dmnb), was unveiled to be much more potent
on inactivating dna-pkcs than vanillin [7]. to
obtain more information regarding the pharmaco-
logical activities of the vanillin derivatives based on
chemical structure, we recently explored a series of
vanillin derivatives and identiﬁed another vanillin
derivative bromovanin (6-bromine-5-hydroxy-4-
methoxybenzaldehyde), which displayed more active
on antiproliferation as well as inhibiting dna-pkcs
kinase activity and inactivating akt in human jurkat
leukemia cells [9]. herein, we further investigated the
antiproliferative eﬀect of bromovanin in various
human somatic cancer cell lines and its related mech-
anism. our results show that bromovanin displays a
killing eﬀect on a broad spectrum of human cancer
cell lines. however, there exists a wide variation on
induction of apoptosis by bromovanin among
diﬀerent cancer cell lines. we further found that the
eﬃciency of apoptotic death induced by bromovanin
cannot account for its powerful antiproliferative
eﬀect. by means of transmission electron microscopy,
we have found that bromovanin obviously induces
autophagic cell death of hepg2 cells. meanwhile,
our results also demonstrates that bromovanin
results in dna-pkcs cleavage and a rapid destruc-
tion of c-myc oncoprotein, as well as elicits dna
double-strand breaks.

2.2. cell culture
human cancer cell lines used in this study including
cervical cancer hela cells, lung cancer a549 cells, liver
cancer hepg2 cells, 7221 cells and 7402 cells, ovarian can-
cer hoc8 cells and a2780 cells, brain cancer bt325 and
bt72 cells, prostate cancer ib-4 cells. all the cell lines
were maintained in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium
(dmem) containing 10% fatal bovine serum, 100 u/ml
of penicillin and 100 lg/ml of streptomycin in a humidi-
ﬁed chamber at 37 °c in 5% co2.
2.3. clonogenic survival
the cells were trypsinized, counted, and diluted to cer-
tain concentrations. an appropriate number of cells
(3 · 102 to 1 · 104) were plated into 60 mm diameter petri
dishes in triplicate, and incubated in the culture medium
containing diﬀerent concentration of bromovanin for
24 h or 6 days, then continuously incubated in the growth
medium without bromovanin. after total of 2 weeks cul-
ture, cells were ﬁxed with methanol, stained with giemsa
solution, and colonies consisting of more than 50 cells
were counted. resulting survival plots were ﬁtted.
2.4. apoptosis detection
the apoptotic cells were determined through measur-
ing the sub-g1 population by ﬂow cytometry. brieﬂy,
after treated with bromovanin for a certain times, the cells
were harvested and ﬁxed with 75% ethanol. cells were
resuspended in pbs plus 0.1% saponine and 1 lg/ml
rnase a (sigma), incubated for 20 min at 37 °c, and
stained with 25 lg/ml propidium iodide (pi) (sigma).
cell-cycle distribution and sub-g1 population was then
evaluated by ﬂow cytometry (>10,000 cells per sample).
the apoptosis was also measured by morphological
observation by ﬂuorescent staining assay [9]. the treated
cells were harvested, and stained simultaneously with multi-
ple ﬂuorescent dyes, hoechst 33258, ﬂuorescein diacetate
(fda) and pi for 15 min. in this assay, fda (20 lg/ml),
a vital dye, was used to stain the cytoplasm of the viable
282
y.-q. yan et al. / cancer letters 252 (2007) 280–289
cells; hoechst 33258 (10 lg/ml) was used to stain the nuclei
of viable and apoptotic cells. the normal viable cells were
stained into even weakly blue under ﬂuorescent micro-
scope, whilst the apoptotic cells were stained bright blue
due to chromatin condensation; pi (10 lg/ml) was used to
stain the necrotic cells or the late stage apoptotic cells.
2.5. transmission electron microscopy
cells were harvested, pelleted, and ﬁxed in 2.5% glutar-
aldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buﬀer.
after rinse with cacodylate buﬀer, the samples were post-
ﬁxed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. the samples were
then rinsed with water, followed by dehydration in a grad-
ed series of alcohol (50%, 75%, and 95–100% alcohol) fol-
lowed by propylene oxide, and kept overnight in 1:1
propylene oxide and poly bed 812. the samples were
embedded in poly bed 812 and cured in a 60 °c oven.
ultrathin sections were obtained with a reichert ultracut
s microtome. sections were stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate and photographed by using a philips
cm 120 transmission electron microscope.
2.6. comet assay
after treated with bromovanin for a certain times, cells
were collected and mixed with low melting point (lmp)
agarose at 37 °c. this mixture was placed on the top of
the previous layer of 0.5% normal melting point (nmp)
agarose on the slide, then covered with a coverslip and
returned to 4 °c until solid. the coverslip was gently
removed and some nmp agarose was added onto the
slide. the slide was then covered again with a coverslip
and placed at 4 °c until the mixture was solid. the slide
was placed in chilled alkaline lysis buﬀer (for dna sin-
gle-strand breaks detection) or neutral lysis buﬀer (for
dna double-strand breaks detection), and subjected to
electrophoresis. thereafter, the slides were gently washed
with neutralization buﬀer, then stained with ethidium bro-
mide, and visualized and analyzed under a ﬂuorescence
microscope. dna damage was expressed as tail moment
combining comet
length and the proportion of
dna migrating into the tail.

2.7. immuno-hybridization analysis
the cells were harvested and washed twice in ice-cold
phosphate buﬀered saline. cell pellets were treated with
the lysis buﬀer (50 mmol/l tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 1% nori-
det p40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/l nacl,
1 piece of protease inhibitor cocktail tablet in 50 ml solu-
tion, roche co., usa), the total protein (40 lg) were
resolved on sds/page, and transferred onto the polyvi-
nylidene ﬂuoride (pvdf) membrane for western blot-
ting. the immuno-hybridization was performed with the
ﬁrst antibodies as indicated above, then incubated with
secondary antibody igg-hrp. protein expression levels
were detected with the luminal analysis reagents (santa
cruz) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.8. reactive oxygen species (ros) detection
cellular ros level was quantiﬁed with 2,7-dichlorodi-
hydroﬂuorescein diacetate (dcf-da) probe (molecular
probestm, carlsbad, ca), which is a cell-permeant indica-
tor for reactive oxygen species that is non-ﬂuorescent until
the acetate groups are removed by intracellular esterases
and oxidation. in the presence of ros, dcfh is oxidized
to highly ﬂuorescent dcf, and the intensity of dcf ﬂuo-
rescence is proportional to the amount of intracellularly
formed ros. dcf ﬂuorescence intensity was measured
by type 374 fluoroskan ascent fl (thermo labsystems,
finland).
2.9. dna-pkcs activity detection
dna-pkcs activity was detected using the signa-
tectò dna-dependent protein kinase assay system
(promega), in which a dna-pk biotinylated p53-derived
peptide acts as the substrate of dna-pkcs. following the
manufacturer’s protocol, reactions (25 ll) contained 40 lg
of whole cell extract from hela cells, dna-pk activation
buﬀer, reaction buﬀer, and 0.5 mci [c-32p]atp. appro-
priate concentrations of bromovanin or vanillin were
included throughout the incubation. samples were incu-
bated at 30 °c for 10 min. termination buﬀer was then
added and 10 ll of each reaction mixture was spotted
onto sam2ò capture membrane. after washing with
2 m nacl, membranes were dried and subjected to expo-
sure of kodak x-omat bt ﬁlm, then the activities of
incorporated 32p-phosphorylated substrate measured by
scintillation counting.
2.10. determination of c-myc protein stability
the cells were pretreated with 20 lm mg132 (sigma,
saint louis, mo) for 2 h to temporarily inhibit protein
degradation, then washed with cold-pbs for three times
to remove mg132, followed by treating with 40 lg/ml
cycloheximide (chx)
(sigma, saint louis, mo) at
37 °c for blocking protein synthesis. the cells were har-
vested after a given time of chx treatment, and subjected
to immunoblotting analysis with anti-c-myc antibody.
3. results
3.1. antiproliferative eﬀect of bromovanin on various
human cancer cell lines
initially, we have compared the eﬀects of vanillin and its
derivatives on the growth of cervical cancer hela cells. the
cells were treated with diﬀerent concentrations of test com-

283
pounds for 72 h, then subjected to measurement of prolifer-
ation activity by mtt assay. as shown in fig. 1a, signiﬁ-
cant inhibition of cell proliferation was observed on
vand8 (6-bromine-5-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde,
we named it bromovanin) but not on vanillin and the other
three derivatives at 10–40 lm of concentrations. the ic50
value is 16.5 lm for bromovanin. the results of cell colony-
forming analyses (survival) indicated that the treatment of
bromovanin for 6 days (fig. 1b) or for 24 h (fig. 1c) exhib-
ited a potent antiproliferative eﬀect on various cancer cell
lines, and the variation of antiproliferative eﬃcacy on dif-
ferent cancer cell lines is very small. the ic50 values derived
from the data of fig. 1b were 12.5–15 lm. bromovanin-in-
duced apoptosis was then measured by means of the sub-g1
population detection of ﬂow cytometry. obviously, there is
a large variation on apoptosis induction by bromovanin on
diﬀerent cancer cell lines (fig. 1d). after treatment with
40 lm bromovanin for 24 h, the occurrence of apoptosis
was 10.35%, 12.6%, 33.03%, 2.8% and 7.75% for hela cells,
hepg2 cells, 7402 cells, a549 cells and a2780 cells, respec-
tively. the variation of apoptosis induction was also
observed by the apoptotic morphological assay of ﬂuores-
cent hoechst 33258 staining (data not shown). in addition,
a diﬀerent extent of g2/m arrest was induced by bromova-
nin on these cancer cell lines (fig. 1d).
3.2. apoptosis and autophagic cell death induced by
bromovanin
the time-course of apoptosis induction by 40 lm bro-
movanin was investigated in hepg2 cells by detecting
sub-g1 population using ﬂow cytometry (fig. 2a and b)
and the ﬂuorescent dye staining assay (fig. 2b). the
induction of apoptosis by bromovanin was shown in a
time-dependent manner, and the ratio of apoptotic cells
was less than 15% even at 24 h treatment of 40 lm bro-
movanin (fig. 2b). the immuno-hybridization assay
showed that only a light decreases of apoptotic proteins
parp and pro-caspase 3 occurred after 24 h treatment
of 40 l bromovanin (fig. 5a). however, the inhibition
of hepg2 cells proliferation by 24 h treatment of 40 lm

ﬂow cytometry; (b) quantitation of apoptosis at diﬀerent time points after 40 lm bromovanin treatment; (c) cell death at diﬀerent time
points after 40 lm bromovanin treatment, observed by light microscopic; (d) clonogenic survival of hepg2 after treated with diﬀerent
concentrations of bomovanin for 24 h; (e) inhibition of bromovanin on cell growth. hepg2 cells were treated with diﬀerent concentrations
of bromovanin for 24 h, then subjected to mtt measurement.
bromovanin was over 80% as documented by light micro-
scopic observation (rounded and detached dying cells)
(fig. 2c), colony-forming assay (fig. 2d) as well as mtt
assay (fig. 2e). the inhibition of cell proliferation by bro-
movanin was also shown in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 2d and e). obviously, the apoptosis cannot completely
account for the antiproliferative eﬀect of bromovanin,
suggesting that there occurred other type(s) of cell death.
therefore, we applied the
transmission electron
microscopy to examine the ultrastructural morphological
changes of bromovanin-treated hepg2 cells. the charac-
teristic morphological changes indicated that autophagic
cell death was induced in hepg2 cells after 40 lm bro-
movanin treatment for 12 h or 24 h. fig. 3b–i shows the
typical autophagic cell death features of bromovanin-
treated cells, e.g., extensive vacuolization, membrane
compartments containing single or multiple organelles.
whereas untreated cells had normal nuclear and cytoplas-
mic morphology (fig. 3a).
3.3. dna damage and ros induced by bromovanin
the eﬃcacy of bromovanin on eliciting dna strand
breaks and intracellular ros was further investigated in
hepg2 cells. the dna double-strand breaks (dsbs)
were evaluated by neutral single-cell gel electrophoresis
(comet assay) and the intracellular ros level was mea-
sured by dcfh-da ﬂuorescent probe. as shown in
fig. 4a and b, dna dsbs were induced in hepg2 cells
from 4 h treatment of 40 lm bromovanin, which is
convinced by the increased length and density of comet

(phosphorylated histone h2ax), a sensitive indicator of
dna dsbs, by immuno-hybridization assay. the result
indicated that ch2ax level dramatically increased after
4–24 h treatment of bromovanin (fig. 5a), further sug-
gesting that bromovanin can induce dna dsbs. we then
measured the cellular ros levels in hepg2 cells after
treated with diﬀerent concentrations of bromovanin for
4 h. as indicated in fig. 4c, the dcf ﬂuorescence intensi-
ty, which corresponds to the intracellular ros levels,
increased in a dose-dependent manner.

3.4. dna-pkcs cleavage induced by bromovanin
it was reported that vanillin was a inhibitor of dna-
pkcs and the ic50 value was about 1.5 mm [7]. as shown
in fig. 5b, the protein level of full-length 465 kda dna-
pkcs in hepg2 cells was obviously decreased after 4 h
and 8 h treatment of 40 lm bromovanin. meanwhile,
there appeared a gradually increasing amount of the
cleaved ddna-pkcs fragments. although the dna-
pkcs level was likely to be recovered at 12–24 h after bro-
movanin treatment, there still remained a high level of
cleaved fragments of dna-pkcs. the decreased level of
dna-pkcs protein was also demonstrated in bromova-
nin-treated hela cells (fig. 5c).
the inhibition of bromovanin on dna-pk activity
in vitro was further assayed, by monitoring the ability
of the extract from hela cells to phosphorylate the
dna-pk-speciﬁc target p53 peptide with [c-32p] atp.
as shown in fig. 5d, the phosphorylation level of target
p53 peptide by dna-pk in the extract of hela cells
decreased by bromovanin in a dose-dependent manner.
the ic50 value for bromovanin was estimated to be
approximate 25 lm. the kinase inhibition reached to
95% at 40 lm bromovanin, while the inhibition eﬃcacy
produced by 100 lm vanillin was only about 20%, even
less than that produced by 20 lm bromovanin, suggesting
that bromovanin is more potent on inhibiting dna-pk
activity than vanillin.
3.5. bromovanin prompts c-myc degradation
we have recently reported that silencing dna-pkcs
by sirna strategy resulted in downregulation of c-myc
oncoprotein [12]. we then asked whether bromovanin,
as an inhibitor of dna-pkcs, aﬀects the cellular level
of c-myc protein. the immuno-hybridization assay
showed that the amount of c-myc protein was signiﬁcant-
ly decreased after treatment with 40 lm bromovanin for
more than 4 h (fig. 6a). phosphorylation of c-myc on
t58 is necessary for activating the ubiquitin/proteasome
pathway to destroy c-myc protein. we detected the phos-
phorylation level of c-myc protein in bromovanin-treated
hepg2 cells by an antibody recognizing the phosphory-
lated-t58/c-myc, and found that

c-myc destruction. cell were ﬁrstly pretreated with bromovanin for 20 h, then mg123 for 2 h, followed by cycloheximide treatment in a
fresh culture medium for a given time as indicated, then followed by immunoblotting analysis of c-myc.
c-myc protein by proteasome inhibitor mg123 in bro-
movanin-treated cells exhibited a higher phosphorylation
level as compared to control cells (fig. 6b).
to investigate the stability of c-myc protein, the time-
course of c-myc degradation was analyzed by measuring
c-myc protein level after blocking protein synthesis with
cycloheximide (chx). the c-myc protein levels were
compared between 40 lm bromovanin-treated cells and
the control cells at 0, 30 and 60 min time points of
chx treatment. before the treatment of chx, the cells
were pre-treated with mg123 for 2 h to accumulate
enough proteins. as shown in fig. 6c, the 67 kda larger
isoform of c-myc was much more obvious after the treat-
ment of proteasome inhibitor mg123 in both bromova-
nin-treated and control cells. in control hela cells, only
the 60 kda isoform decreased in a certain extent after
blocking protein synthesis, while the 67 kda larger iso-
form remained no change even at 60 min after chx treat-
ment. in contrast, the cellular levels of both 60 kda
isoform and 67 kda isoform were remarkably decreased
at 30 min, and almost completely degraded at 60 min after
chx treatment in the bromovanin-treated cells. this

4. discussion
we have previously reported that bromovanin
induces apoptosis of human jurkat leukemia cells
[9]. the antiproliferative eﬀect of bromovanin on
various cancer cell lines has been further demon-
strated in the present study (fig. 1). although the
extent of antiproliferation by bromovanin is almost
identical on diﬀerent cell
lines, a wide variation
(2.8–33%) was observed on the eﬃciency of apopto-
sis induction by 40 lm bromovanin among the cell
lines (fig. 1d). it is believed that apoptosis is not the
only type of programmed cell death (pcd) for
mammalian cells. recently, accumulating evidence
implicates that autophagic cell death is another
important physiological cell death process, which
is characterized by massive degradation of cellular
contents,
including essential organelles such as
mitochondria, by means of the complicated intracel-
lular membrane/vesicle reorganization and lyso-
somal activity [14–18]. autophagy can be induced
by various conditions, e.g., starvation [14,15], hor-
monal stimulation [14],
ionizing radiation [16],
tgf-b1 [17], hdac inhibitors [18]. in present
study, we demonstrated that bromovanin induces
not only apoptosis, but also autophagic cell death
in human liver cancer hepg2 cells (fig. 3), by
means of transmission electron microscopy, the
‘‘golden standard’’ for autophagy.
it is well known that inhibition of dna-pkcs
can result in the reduction of dna double-strand
break repair and the radiosensitization of cells.
recently, daido et al. reported that inhibition of
dna-pkcs can prompt the induction of autopha-
gy, which was manifested by the observation that
288
y.-q. yan et al. / cancer letters 252 (2007) 280–289
2gy c-ray induced autophagic cell death in dna-
pkcs-deﬁcient m059j cells, but not
in dna-
pkcs-eﬃcient m059k cells [16]. they also showed
that the inhibition of dna-pkcs by antisense oligo-
nucleotides against dna-pkcs radiosensitized can-
cer cells by inducing autophagy. we showed here
that bromovanin targets dna-pkcs cleavage or
inactivate dna-pkcs in hepg2 cells and hela
cells. in hepg2 cells, cleavage of dna-pkcs obvi-
ously occurred at 4 h and 8 h after 40 lm bromov-
anin treatment. although the dna-pkcs level was
likely to be recovered at 12–24 h,
there still
remained an high level of the cleaved fragments of
dna-pkcs. while
cleaved non-functional
fragment might interact with the ku subunits of
dna-pk, and competitively inhibits the activity
of dna-pkcs [19,20]. based on above observa-
tions, we suggest that the induction of autophagic
cell death by bromovanin is in some way associated
with the inactivation of dna-pkcs.
the
we have recently reported that depression of
dna-pkcs by sirna strategy resulted in downreg-
ulation of c-myc oncoprotein [12]. in the present
study, we also showed that the treatment of bro-
movanin remarkably decreased the cellular level of
c-myc protein. our data further indicated that c-
myc protein degraded more quickly in bromova-
nin-treated cells as compared to the control cells.
phosphorylation of c-myc protein on thr58 is
essential for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of
c-myc destruction [21]. our data show that bromov-
anin treatment leads to an increased level of the
phosphorylation of c-myc on thr58 as well as more
rapid destruction of c-myc protein. it is clear that
bromovanin can increase the destruction of c-myc
protein likely via inactivating dna-pkcs, even
though it is still unclear whether this increased
destruction of c-myc is associated with autophagy
induced by bromovanin or not.
although vanillin was shown to display antioxi-
dant activity [22], our result indicated, in contrast,
that bromovanin stimulated intracellular ros pro-
duction, and subsequently eliciting notable dna
double-strand breaks in hepg2 cells, as well as
g2/m arrest in a number of cancer cell lines. it
can be reasonably inferred that
this increased
dna lesions by bromovanin might be caused by
the enhanced reactive oxygen species in cells and/
or the inhibition of dna damage repair as the con-
sequence of dna-pkcs inactivation.
taken together, we suggest that bromovanin can
disrupt the balance of cellular dna integrity by
enhancing dna damage and inhibiting dna dam-
age repair, subsequently elicits both apoptosis and
autophagic cell death. the inactivation of dna-
pkcs and destruction of c-myc oncoprotein con-
tribute at least in part to the antiproliferative eﬀect
of bromovanin. moreover, it is believed to be an
emerging eﬀective therapeutic approach for treating
cancers to speciﬁcally target the autophagic cell
death machine, especially for treating the cancers
with resistance to apoptotic cell death. the capabil-
ity of bromovanin in initiating not only apoptosis
but also autophagic cell death further promises it
as an attractive strategy for developing advanced
anticancer drugs.
