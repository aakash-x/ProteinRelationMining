abstract
proper removal of oxidized proteins is an important determinant of success when evaluat-
ing the ability of cells to handle oxidative stress. the ubiquitin/proteasome system has been
considered the main responsible mechanism for the removal of oxidized proteins, as it can
discriminate between normal and altered proteins, and selectively target the latter ones for
degradation. a possible role for lysosomes, the other major intracellular proteolytic system,
in the removal of oxidized proteins has been often refused, mostly on the basis of the lack
of selectivity of this system. although most of the degradation of intracellular components
in lysosomes (autophagy) takes place through ‘‘in bulk’’ sequestration of complete cytosolic
regions, selective targeting of proteins to lysosomes for their degradation is also possible via
what is known as chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma). in this work, we review recent
evidence supporting the participation of cma in the clearance of oxidized proteins in the fore-
front of the cellular response to oxidative stress. the consequences of an impairment in cma
activity, observed during aging and in some age-related disorders, are also discussed.

1. introduction: oxidative stress and lysosomes
cells activate diﬀerent mechanisms in response to oxidative stress in order to pre-
vent damage to intracellular components by the free radicals generated under these
conditions. however, this display of defensive mechanisms is often not enough to
completely avoid cellular injury, and a second front of defence, aimed at the repair
and removal of damaged components, is required. the ubiquitin/proteasome system
and lysosomes are the main systems responsible for the turnover of intracellular
components and for cell clearance. degradation of oxidized proteins by the protea-
some has been well documented both in vitro and in cultured cells (for review see
shringarpure et al., 2001; grune et al., 2003; keller et al., 2004). in contrast, for a
long time, lysosomes have been considered ‘‘the bad guys’’ in the context of oxidative
stress, as they are a common target for the damaging eﬀect of free radicals. the
action of these reactive oxygen species on lysosomes is double. on one hand, through
promoting cross-linking of protein components at the lysosomal membrane, they
increase the lysosomal proton permeability consequently raising the ph of the lyso-
some (wan et al., 2001). because lysosomal hydrolases are maximally active at very
low ph, these changes in lysosomal ph decrease the ability of lysosomes to degrade
the internalized substrates, which with time, become resistant to degradation (due to
non-speciﬁc cross-linking and oxidation) and accumulate inside lysosomes in the
form of an autoﬂuorescent pigment known as lipofuscin (terman and brunk,
2004). on the other hand, free radicals can also directly damage the lysosomal mem-
brane to an extent that results in leakage of lysosomal hydrolases out to the cytosol.
these free hydrolases contribute to further organelle damage, leading, in extreme sit-
uations, to activation of the apoptotic program and cell death (olejnicka et al., 1999;
brunk and terman, 2002). despite this negative picture of the role of lysosomes dur-
ing oxidative stress, emerging evidence suggests that these catastrophic eﬀects occur
only during massive acute oxidative stress, and that, in the early stages of oxidation
and in circumstances associated to mild-oxidative stress, the lysosomal system
instead plays a protective role because it contributes to the removal of oxidized

and damaged intracellular components via autophagy. this review focuses on the
beneﬁcial eﬀect of the activation of a particular type of autophagy, chaperone-med-
iated autophagy, as part of the cellular response to oxidative stress.
2. selective autophagy via chaperone-mediated autophagy
three diﬀerent types of autophagy have been described in mammalian cells, based
on the mechanisms utilized for the delivery of cargo to lysosomes (cuervo, 2004;
yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005). chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma) is the type
of autophagy wherein a particular pool of soluble cytosolic proteins is selectively tar-
geted to lysosomes for degradation (majeski and dice, 2004; massey et al., 2004).
the substrate proteins are recognised by a chaperone–cochaperone complex which

fig. 1. hypothetical model for chaperone-mediated autophagy. certain cytosolic proteins bearing a
particular targeting motif are recognized by a cytosolic chaperone/cochaperone complex which delivers
them to the lysosomal membrane. here this complex binds to a receptor protein at the lysosomal
membrane, and after undergoing unfolding, substrate proteins are translocated into the lysosomal lumen,
in a process mediated by a lysosomal resident chaperone. once in the lumen, substrates are rapidly
degraded by the potent combination of lysosomal proteases. lamp-2a: lysosome associated membrane
protein type 2a; kferq: cma-targeting sequence; hsc70: heat shock cognate protein of 70 kda.

delivers them to the lysosomal membrane (chiang et al., 1989). here they bind to a
receptor protein, the lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp-2a)
(cuervo and dice, 1996), and after unfolding (salvador et al., 2000), the substrate
proteins are translocated across the lysosomal membrane assisted by a lysosomal-
resident chaperone (agarraberes et al., 1997), following which they are degraded
in the hydrolase-rich lumen (fig. 1).
in addition to this peculiar form of delivery of substrates to lysosomes, the type of
substrates degraded through this pathway, as well as the mechanisms of activation
and regulation, set cma apart from the other two forms of autophagy – macroauto-
phagy and microautophagy. these last two types of autophagy involve non-selective
‘‘in bulk’’ engulfment of complete cytosolic regions, including both organelles and
soluble proteins (cuervo, 2004; yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005), while cma caters
to soluble cytosolic proteins only. on this respect, a feature unique to cma is the
selectivity in the degradation of these cytosolic proteins. in fact, cma can only
degrade cytosolic proteins which contain a cma-targeting motif, biochemically
related to the pentapeptide kferq (dice, 1990). cma’s intrinsic selectivity seems
beneﬁcial under particular conditions in which discrimination between diﬀerent
types of proteins for degradation is required. for example, although macroauto-
phagy is induced early in starvation to generate essential amino acids (otherwise sup-
plied in the diet) through the breakdown of existing organelles and proteins
(mizushima, 2005), this random degradation can only be maintained during a rela-
tively short period of time (10 h), beyond which it needs to be replaced by the selec-
tive degradation provided by cma (wing et al., 1991; cuervo et al., 1995).
activation of cma under these conditions favors degradation of unnecessary pro-
teins against that of proteins essential for cell survival.
3. main players in cma
both cytosolic and lysosomal chaperones are required for completion of cma.
the cytosolic chaperone, hsc70, the constitutive member of the hsp70 family of chap-
erones, recognizes and binds to the targeting motif in the substrates and, by still
poorly understood mechanisms, promotes delivery of substrates to the lysosomal
membrane (chiang et al., 1989). the interaction between substrate and hsc70 is
modulated by other cytosolic co-chaperones including hsp90, hsp40, hip, hop and
bag-1 (agarraberes and dice, 2001). the speciﬁc role of each of these cochaperones
in cma remains unknown but, by extension of what is known about their partici-
pation in other cellular processes, it is likely that they modulate substrate/chaperone
interaction and unfolding of the substrate protein at the lysosomal membrane by
regulating the atp/adp hydrolysis cycles of hsc70.
the lysosomal counterpart of cytosolic hsc70, namely the lysosomal hsc70 (lys-
hsc70), is absolutely necessary for substrate translocation across the lysosomal mem-
brane (agarraberes et al., 1997). in fact, the presence or not of this chaperone in the
lysosomal lumen determines whether or not a particular lysosome is capable of
cma (cuervo et al., 1997). many questions still remain unanswered about this
448
s. kaushik, a.m. cuervo / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 444–454
chaperone. for example, it is not known how it accesses the lysosomal lumen, if it
requires other cochaperones to modulate its function inside lysosomes, or what is
the mechanism by which it facilitates substrate translocation.
the limiting step in cma is the interaction of the substrate/chaperone complex
with the lysosomal receptor (cuervo and dice, 2000a). lamp-2a is a single-span
transmembrane protein whose short cytosolic tail contains positively charged resi-
dues essential for the binding of the substrates (cuervo and dice, 1996; cuervo
and dice, 2000b). cma activity directly correlates with levels of lamp-2a in the
lysosomal membrane (cuervo and dice, 2000b). these levels are tightly regulated
by at least three diﬀerent mechanisms including changes in the degradation of
lamp-2a at the lysosomal membrane (cuervo et al., 2003), in its distribution
between the lysosomal membrane and lumen (cuervo and dice, 2000a) and also
through de novo synthesis of this receptor (kiﬃn et al., 2004). recently, lamp-
2a has been shown to dynamically associate to particular lipid microdomains at
the lysosomal membrane, further identiﬁed as the speciﬁc sites where degradation
of this receptor occurs (kaushik et al., 2006). lamp-2a organizes in the membrane
as cma-active multimeric complexes (cuervo and dice, 2000b), but its localization
inside the lipid microdomains prevents this multimerization.
4. cma as part of the cellular response to stress
along with macroautophagy, cma is considered to be a stress-induced pathway.
as discussed before, cma provides the essential amino acids critical for cellular sur-
vival when the dietary supply of nutrients is limited for extended periods of time,
while also preventing the degradation of proteins essential during these stress condi-
tions (cuervo et al., 1995). the signal transduction events that result in this activa-
tion of cma are still unclear. the sequential activation of macroautophagy followed
by cma during starvation has led to hypothesize that degradation via macroauto-
phagy of a yet unknown inhibitor of cma could be behind cma activation under
these conditions. activation of cma is associated with particular changes in lyso-
somes: enrichment in hsc70, increased levels of lamp-2a that multimerizes to form
cma-active complexes and relocation of lysosomes to the perinuclear region
(cuervo et al., 1995; cuervo and dice, 2000b). the signiﬁcance of lysosomal reloca-
tion remains unclear, but it could favor homotypic fusions between lysosomes, thus
promoting the transfer of part of hsc70 from cma-active to cma-inactive lyso-
somes, in order to recruit them for cma.
in addition to nutritional stress, other conditions known to activate this pathway
include mild-oxidative stress (as discussed in more detail below) (kiﬃn et al., 2004)
and stress induced by exposure to toxic compounds (cuervo et al., 1999). in this last
condition, cma activation is required for the selective removal of proteins directly
altered by the chemical compounds, which otherwise would accumulate as toxic mul-
timeric complexes inside cells.
experimental proof for the essential role of cma as part of the cellular response
to stress has been recently provided in cells in which cma was selectively blocked
s. kaushik, a.m. cuervo / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 444–454
449
(massey et al., 2006). while cells with impaired cma maintain normal survival rates
under normal conditions and are able to up-regulate other autophagic pathways,
namely macroautophagy, to preserve normal rates of protein degradation, the block-
age of cma makes them extremely vulnerable to stressors. exposure of cma-
impaired cells to diﬀerent pro-oxidants, oxidants and to uv results in dramatic
decrease in cell viability, activation of the apoptotic program and cell death (massey
et al., 2006).
5. cma and oxidative stress
to further characterize this proposed role of cma in the cellular response to
stress, we have evaluated the participation of this autophagic pathway in the removal
of oxidized proteins. we have found that induction of mild-oxidative stress in
rodents and culture cells increases the degradation of proteins via cma (kiﬃn

usually non-substrate proteins, could all contribute to facilitate substrate delivery and translocation into
lysosomes. (b) eﬀect on the lysosomal system: mild-oxidative stress results in an increase in the lysosomal

et al., 2004). in fact, elevated amounts of oxidized proteins can be detected under
these conditions in the lumen of cma-active lysosomes.
part of the enhanced cma directly results from the oxidative modiﬁcation of the
cma substrates, which are more readily degraded through this pathway compared
to their unmodiﬁed counterparts (kiﬃn et al., 2004; finn and dice, 2005) (fig. 2a).
it is possible that partial unfolding, typically associated with oxidative damage,
could expose hidden cma-targeting motifs, facilitating their recognition by the
cytosolic chaperone complex. substrate unfolding could also accelerate translocation
across the lysosomal membrane by eliminating the unfolding step (fig. 2a). inde-
pendent of this eﬀect on the substrate, changes in the lysosomal compartment also
contribute to increased cma activity during oxidative stress. thus, we have found
that levels of both the receptor and the lysosomal chaperone (lys-hsc70) increase,
resulting in a higher number of translocation units per lysosome under these condi-
tions (kiﬃn et al., 2004) (fig. 2b).
regarding the magnitude and the consequences of cma activation in the context
of oxidative stress, it is anticipated that only proteins bearing the cma-targeting
motif, about 30% of cytosolic proteins, would be removed by this pathway under
these conditions. however, taking into account that the cma-targeting motif is
not sequence-linked, but it depends primarily on the physical properties of the con-
stituent amino acids, it has been proposed that oxidation could convert a non-target-
ing motif into a cma-targeting motif by modifying one or more of the amino acid
residues (gracy et al., 1998). experimental evidence supporting this possibility is still
missing.
6. including the ‘‘aging’’ factor in the cma/oxidation equation
poor cellular response to oxidative stress underlies the basis of many chronic dis-
orders and of aging (simpson et al., 2003; keller et al., 2004). cma activity has been
shown to decrease with age in rodents and in senescent human ﬁbroblasts in culture
(dice, 1982; cuervo and dice, 2000c). impaired cma activity could contribute in
part to the accumulation of oxidized and damaged proteins in aged organisms.
in contrast to the dramatic changes in the lysosomal system described in old
organisms (enlargement of lysosome-related structures, intralysosomal accumulation
of poorly degraded products in the form of lipofuscin, increased lysosomal mem-
brane lability) (hochshild, 1970; noda and suzuki, 1980), the group of lysosomes
active for cma shows no major morphological changes and preserves proteolytic
activity with age (cuervo and dice, 2000c). in fact, once cma substrates access
the lumen of old rodents’ lysosomes they display similar kinetics of degradation to
those observed in lysosomes from young animals. likewise, binding of substrate pro-
teins to the cytosolic chaperone and their targeting to the lysosomal membrane also
seems to be unaﬀected with age (cuervo and dice, 2000c). the main age-related deﬁ-
ciency seems to be in the binding and uptake of the substrates in the lysosomal mem-
brane. this defect is due to a decline in the levels of lamp-2a at the lysosomal
membrane with age (cuervo and dice, 2000). lower levels of lamp-2a are initially
s. kaushik, a.m. cuervo / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 444–454
451
compensated by increasing the number of lysosomes active for this pathway (those
containing lys-hsc70). however, with advancing age, the low levels of lamp-2a
decrease to such an extent that the chaperone compensation is not enough, leading
to the impaired binding and uptake of the substrate proteins into lysosomes (cuervo
and dice, 2000c). recent ﬁndings from our laboratory suggest that altered turnover
of the receptor itself could be behind its reduced levels with age and the consequent
decrease in cma activity (zeng, m., kaushik, s., massey, a., bandyophadhyay, u.,
kiﬃn, r., cuervo, a.m., in preparation).
based on the ﬁndings in cultured cells with experimentally blocked cma (massey
et al., 2006), it could be inferred that the decrease in cma activity with age would
leave cells vulnerable to diﬀerent stressors, in particular those resulting in the gener-
ation of reactive oxygen species and protein damage/misfolding. because of the pro-
posed role of cma in the selective removal of oxidized and damaged proteins,
failure of this pathway with age could contribute to the abnormal accumulation of
these altered products observed in aged organisms.
7. diﬀerent pathways for a common purpose
activation of cma during oxidative stress seems to obey the need for selective
removal of the damaged proteins without aﬀecting the functional neighboring ones.
however, degradation of oxidized proteins also occurs through the ubiquitin/pro-
teasome system. why this need for redundant pathways? one possibility is that
oxidized proteins follow the same degradation pathways than their unmodiﬁed
forms, but in an accelerated manner. in this case, when oxidized, cma substrates
will be degraded by cma, and proteasome substrates will be degraded by the pro-
teasome. however, the concept that a particular protein only follows a determined
proteolytic pathway has become obsolete, as numerous examples now support that
the same protein can be degraded by diﬀerent proteolytic systems depending on the
cellular conditions. it is thus possible that activation of the ubiquitin/proteasome
system during oxidative stress provides for the rapid removal of oxidized proteins,
but as the oxidation conditions persist, oxidized proteins are instead delivered to
lysosomes via cma, in order to devote proteasomal activity to critical regulatory
tasks. however, we cannot discard that both systems are simultaneously active
during oxidation, and that, depending on the cell type and particular conditions,
diﬀerent percentages of oxidized proteins are delivered to one system or the other.
the main limitation to accurately quantify the amount of proteins that follow one
or the other proteolytic pathway is the fact that most of the available assays rely
on the use of blockers of these pathways. however, there is growing evidence that
supports the existence of a cross-talk between diﬀerent proteolytic systems, and the
eliciting of compensatory mechanisms among them in response to functional fail-
ure. consequently, most of the attempts to quantify degradation using blockers
of one pathway are likely to enhance the proteolytic activity of other pathways
to compensate for this failure, leading to erroneous calculations. new approaches
need to be devised to directly track within cells the fate of multiple proteins and
452
s. kaushik, a.m. cuervo / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 444–454
their delivery to one proteolytic system or another, without perturbing the activity
of these systems.
8. concluding remarks and pending questions
opposed to the classical view that depicted lysosomes as one of the main reasons
responsible for cellular damage during oxidative stress, recent evidence supports a
protective role for the lysosomal system in the early phases of the oxidative insult
and in conditions leading to mild-oxidative stress. the selectivity intrinsic to cma
allows lysosomes to discriminate between altered and unmodiﬁed proteins, promot-
ing the removal only of the former. the decline in cma activity with age can con-
tribute to the accumulation of damaged proteins typical of old organisms. however,
the consequences of decreased cma activity could be diﬀerent in diﬀerent tissues,
depending on the rate of protein turnover, the contribution of other proteolytic
pathways and their particular susceptibility to stress. also unknown is the reason
for the redundancy in this task of cma and the ubiquitin/proteasome system.
how do cells discriminate where to send the oxidized proteins? are particular dam-
aged proteins delivered to one system and others to the other? are both pathways
activated simultaneously or sequentially? is this dual activation common for all types
of cells? and in regards to the degradation of these altered proteins by cma, diﬀer-
ent types of protein-damage have been described during aging and in chronic disor-
ders (i.e. nitration, glycation, modiﬁcation by products of lipid peroxidation), do all
types of protein damage facilitate degradation, at least of cma substrates, by this
pathway, or are there particular conformational modiﬁcations associated to partic-
ular types of protein damage, that determine their suitability for cma degradation?
these and other questions require further clariﬁcation.
