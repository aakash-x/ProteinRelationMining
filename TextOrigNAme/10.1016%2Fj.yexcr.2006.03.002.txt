lysosomal degradation of cytoplasm by way of autophagy is essential for cellular amino acid
homeostasis and for tissue remodeling. in insects such as drosophila, autophagy is
developmentally upregulated in the larval fat body prior to metamorphosis. here,
autophagy is induced by the hormone ecdysone through down-regulation of the autophagy-
suppressive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) signaling pathway. in yeast, vps18 and other
members of the hops complex have been found essential for autophagic degradation. in
drosophila, the vps18 homologue deep orange (dor) has previously been shown to mediate
fusion of multivesicular endosomes with lysosomes. a requirement of dor for ecdysone-
mediated chromosome puffing has also been reported. in the present report, we have tested
the hypothesis that dor may control programmed autophagy at the level of ecdysone signaling
as well as by mediating autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion. we show that dor mutants are
defective in programmed autophagy and provide evidence that autophagy is blocked at two
levels. first, pi3k activity was not down-regulated correctly in dor larvae, which correlated with
a decrease in ecdysone reporter activity. the down-regulation of pi3k activity was restored by
feeding ecdysone to the mutant larvae. second, neither exogenous ecdysone nor
overexpression of pten, a silencer of pi3k signaling, restored fusion of autophagosomes
with lysosomes in the fat body of dor mutants. these results indicate that dor controls
autophagy indirectly, via ecdysone signaling, as well as directly, via autolysosomal fusion.

then fuses with the lysosome, releases its inner vesicle and
forms a degradative compartment known as the autolysosome
[1]. autophagy plays an important role in providing amino
acids under low nutrient conditions by degrading proteins and
organelles [3,4] and has also been shown to be important
during development. for instance, in drosophila melanogaster,
autophagy is responsible for tissue remodeling and for
providing nutrients during the pupal period when the larva
develops into an adult fly [4]. impaired autophagy has been

introduction
macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is the
process by which cytoplasmic content is shuttled to the
lysosome for degradation. from yeast, it is thought that
autophagy initiates from a pre-autophagosomal structure
(pas) [1,2]. this pas structure elongates upon stimuli to form
a double-membraned isolation membrane which forms a so-
called autophagosome when enclosed. the autophagosome

implicated in several human disorders, such as neurodegen-
erative diseases, cancer and myopathy [5]. because of its
importance in (patho)physiology, it is essential to characterize
the regulatory and effector mechanisms of autophagy.
the onset of autophagy in drosophila development has
been shown to be dependent on the increasing titer of 20-
hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) during the last larval stage,
called l3 [6]. this developmentally induced event is termed
programmed autophagy and is independent of starvation
induction. ecdysone is synthesized in the ring gland [7], and
when ecdysone reaches the fat body, autophagy is initiated
through the down-regulation of class i pi3k [6,8]. pi3k has been
shown to be a negative regulator of autophagy in mammalian
cells, drosophila and in caenorhabditis elegans [9–11]. active pi3k
catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trispho-
sphate (pi(3,4,5)p3) at the plasma membrane [12], which in turn
recruits effectors such as the growth-regulatory proteins akt
and pdk1 that harbor a pi(3,4,5)p3-binding pleckstrin homology
(ph) domain [13]. the levels of pi(3,4,5)p3 are negatively
regulated by pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue
deleted from chromosome 10), a phosphatase that depho-
sphorylates pi(3,4,5)p3 at the 3-position of the inositol-ring
[14]. we have previously shown that autophagy in the larval
fat body can be induced by overexpressing pten in a
dominant-negative ecdysone receptor background [6].
the molecular machinery of autophagy has been thoroughly
studied in yeast, and a number of autophagy-linked proteins
have been identified [15–17]. among these are the proteins in the
hops complex that consists of the class c vps (vacuolar protein
sorting) complex (vps18, vps11, vps33 and vps16), in addition to
vps41 and vps39. from yeast studies using protein precursors
that are modified by lysosomal hydrolases as markers for intact
transport [18,19], it is known that the vps class c complex is
needed for fusion of endosomes or autophagosomes with the

programmed autophagy. (f–g) lamp1 is localized to large gfp-lc3-positive autolysosomes in control fat body tissue (f, arrows),
whereas in dor1 mutants lamp1 localizes in numerous small gfp-lc3-negative structures (g). scale bar is 10 μm in frames a, c
and e and 2 μm in frames b, d, f and g.

vacuole, as well as for transport from the golgi to endosomes.
the drosophila homologue of vps18, dor, has been shown to
function in the endocytic pathway [20,21]. multivesicular endo-
somes accumulate in dor mutant clones of the drosophila eye
imaginal disc, indicating that dor, like vps18, is required for
fusion of multivesicular endosomes with lysosomes [20]. dor is
also involved in fusion of golgi-derived vesicles with rab7-
positive endocytic compartments [21]. so far, it has not been
determined whether dor plays any role in autophagy. however,
early studies showed that the polytene chromosomes of the
salivary glands of dor mutant larvae lack ecdysone-related
puffing. adding ecdysone to cultured salivary glands could
restore this puffing pattern, suggesting the possibility that dor
may be required for ecdysone signaling [22,23].
to test the hypothesis that dor is involved in programmed
autophagy by both being required for ecdysone signaling and
for lysosomal fusion, we have made use of a recently
developed assay that is based on the autophagosomal marker
lc3 fused with gfp and the lysosomal dye lysotracker [4,6].
lc3/atg8 is a protein that is localized on the membranes of
the pre-autophagosomal structure, the autophagosome and
inside the autolysosome [6,24,25]. since the gfp is quite
stable also in the autolysosomal lumen after the fusion with
the lysosome/vacuole, the gfp-lc3 fusion protein can be
used as a marker for autophagy [6,24,26]. lysotracker has
been shown to stain lysosomes and autolysosomes in the
larval fat body [4,6]. previous results have shown that
autophagosomes are small gfp-lc3-positive and lyso-
tracker-negative structures whereas autolysosomes are char-
acterized by the co-localization of gfp-lc3 and lysotracker in
large (2 μm) structures. in the course of the present study, we
found that, under certain circumstances, autophagosomes
may be negative for gfp-lc3, probably because the protein
dissociates or is degraded during prolonged exposure to
hydrolytic enzymes. we have therefore also used electron
microscopy to monitor autophagy.
using these assays, we show here that dor mutants are
defective in programmed autophagy and that fat bodies of
mutant larvae show an accumulation of autophagosomes that
fail to fuse with lysosomes. we also find that pi3k activity is
not down-regulated in the dor mutant and that this can be
restored by feeding ecdysone to the mutant larvae. further-
more, we provide evidence that the ecdysone levels in the fat
body nuclei are lower than in control larvae. nevertheless,
overexpression of pten in the fat body of dor mutants does not
restore autophagy. these results indicate that dor controls
autophagy indirectly, via ecdysone signaling, as well as
directly, via autolysosomal fusion.

lysotracker assay
fluorescence microscopy
larvae of the appropriate stage were dissected in pbs. the fat
body was incubated for 1 min in lysotracker® red dnd-99
(molecular probes) diluted 1:200 in pbs. the tissue was
mounted in 80% glycerol in pbs containing 0.4% n-propylgal-
late (sigma) as anti-fading agent. the samples were directly
visualized by confocal microscopy.
images were recorded using a zeiss lsm 510 meta confocal
microscope and processed using adobe photohop 7.0. for the
staining of hrp-lamp1, we used rabbit anti-hrp antibodies
from sigma #p7899 (1:400) and cy3-conjugated secondary
antibodies from jackson immunoresearch.
ecdysone reporter assay
electron microscopy
the experiment was carried out as described [30]. uas-nlacz56
was used since this construct has a low background expres-
sion of lacz in the fat body at the wl3 stage. the w;hs-gal4-
usp;uas-nlacz56 larvae were fixed in 4% formaldehyde con-
taining 0.3% triton-x100 (sigma), washed three times in
pbs + 0.3% triton-x100 (pbx) and blocked in pbx, 0.1% bsa
(sigma) and 5% normal goat serum (sigma). the presence of
lacz was detected by mouse anti-β-galactosidase from
promega, #z378a (1:100) at 4°c overnight before the tissue
was washed in pbx + 0.1% bsa and incubated with cy2-
conjugated secondary antibody (jackson immunoresearch)
for 2 h at room temperature. the tissue was then washed
again four times for 10 min before it was mounted in 80%
glycerol in pbs containing 0.4% n-propylgallate.

vials with dor1/y;cg-gal4,uas-gfp-lc3/uas-pten and w;cg-
gal4,uas-gfp-lc3/uas-pten larvae were placed on 18°c for
7 days then 25°c for 3 days and 30°c for ∼8 h. late wl3
larvae were then dissected, stained with lysotracker and
imaged by confocal microscopy or fixed directly for electron
microscopy.
ecdysone feeding
for the autophagy assay, wandering l3 dor1/y;cggal4,uas-gfp-
lc3 larvae were fed 15 μg/ml 20-hydroxyecdysone (sigma) for
4 h in pbs containing 20% sucrose and heat-killed yeast [6]. as
control dor1/y;cg-gal4,uas-gfp-lc3, larvae were incubated in
the sugar/yeast solution alone for the same amount of time.
cg-gal4,uas-gfp-lc3 early l3 larvae that are responsive to
ecdysone, but without detectable levels of the hormone, were
treated in the same way to test for the ability of the ecdysone
solution to induce autophagy in the experiment. after
incubation, lwl3 dor1/y;cg-gal4,uas-gfp-lc3 larvae and early
l3 cg-gal4,uas-gfp-lc3 larvae were stained with lysotracker
and imaged.
for the gfp-ph assay, we used the assay developed by
colombani and co-workers [32]. flies were allowed to lay eggs
for 4 h. wild-type (tgfp-ph) and mutant (dor1/y;tgfp-ph) larvae
were transferred 48 h and 72 h after egg deposition (aed),
respectively, to a small piece of fly food covered with yeast
paste containing 0.25 mg/ml ecdysone (dissolved in ethanol).
gfp-ph levels at the plasma membrane were visualized by
confocal microscopy 96 h aed for wild-type larvae and 118 h
fat bodies were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate
buffer, ph 7.2. samples were postfixed with 2% oso4 and 1.5%
kfecn in the same buffer, poststained with 4% uranyl acetate,
dehydrated in increasing alcohol concentrations and embed-
ded with epon. sections of 40–50 nm were cut on a leica
ultracut, counterstained with 2% lead citrate and observed in a
philips cm10 electron microscope at 60–80 kv.
results
programmed autophagy is impaired in deep orange mutants
in drosophila, programmed autophagy is initiated by ecdysone
at the early l3 (el3) stage and can be observed as small gfp-
lc3-positive autophagosomes [4,6,33]. due to several autop-
hagosomes fusing with each lysosome, the size of the gfp-lc3/
lysotracker-positive autolysosomes increases to a final size of
2–5 μm by the late wandering l3 (lwl3) stage. by using this gfp-
lc3/lysotracker assay [6], we compared wild-type animals to
dor mutants at the lwl3 stage. we used the hypomorphic dor1
allele since dor1 animals show a severe trafficking defect while
still surviving the lwl3 stage, unlike the stronger dor8 allele [21].
the cytoplasm of fat body cells from wild-type larvae at the
late wandering l3 stage was filled with autolysosomes,
recognized as large vesicles positive for both gfp-lc3 and
lysotracker (figs. 1a–bʺ). in contrast, dor1 mutant fat body cells
contained no autolysosomes, but instead many smaller
lysotracker-positive structures and occasionally a few gfp-
lc3-positive structures (that never co-localized with lyso-
tracker) (figs. 1c–dʺ). this phenotype was similar to the dor1/
dor8 trans-heterozygous larvae, showing that the defect was
due to dor1 itself and not a secondary mutation on the same
chromosome (fig. 1e). to further characterize the dor1 pheno-
type, we used the lysosomal marker hrp-lamp1 in both dor1
and control larvae. whereas the control larvae showed large
structures positive for lamp1 and gfp-lc3 (fig. 1f), dor1
mutant fat body cells contained numerous small lamp1
structures which were gfp-lc3-negative (fig. 1g).
in order to study the effects of the dor mutation at the
ultrastructural level, we analyzed fat bodies of wild-type and
dor1 mutant lwl3 larvae by electron microscopy. consistent
with the gfp-lc3/lysotracker assay, the wild-type larvae
contained a large number of large-sized (∼2 μm) autolyso-
somes distinguished by their content of endoplasmic reti-
culum and mitochondrial remnants (figs. 2a–b), whereas

very few autolysosomes were detected in the dor1 mutant
(figs. 2c–d). surprisingly, the mutant fat body did contain a
large number of autophagosomes (figs. 2c–d) that were not
visualized by the gfp-lc3 assay. a possible explanation for
the lack of gfp-lc3 signal in the autophagosomes will be
provided in the discussion section. these results show that
dor is needed for programmed autophagy at the wandering l3
stage. the accumulation of autophagosomes in the dor1
mutant suggests that dor is required for the fusion of
autophagosomes with lysosomes.
the expression of uas-dor+ by cg-gal4 in a dor background
restored autophagy levels in the fat body as seen by co-
localization of gfp-lc3 and lysotracker in large vesicles (fig.
3b). uas-dor+ also rescued the dor phenotype independently of
the driver as shown by the presence of large lysotracker-
positive structures (fig. 3c). this shows that the dor1 mutation
is responsible for the observed autophagy phenotype.
dor1 mutants fail to down-regulate pi3k in the larval fat body
programmed autophagy in the fat body is ecdysone-dependent
[6]. dor has been shown to be required for ecdysone-induced
puffing in the salivary gland, a phenotype which is reversed by
exogenous ecdysone [23]. because of this, we asked whether
dor1 larvae might be ecdysone-deficient and whether this could
be part of the reason for the impaired autophagy in the dor1 fat
body. ecdysone initiates programmed autophagy by down-
regulating the pi3k pathway [6]. active pi3k can be visualized
by using a gfp-ph construct that binds to pi(3,4,5)p3 at the
plasma membrane. when ecdysone titers are high, the pi3k
activity is down-regulated, and the gfp-ph staining is lost at
the plasma membrane [6,28,32]. we therefore examined
whether dor1 mutant fat bodies showed gfp-ph staining at
the plasma membrane at the lwl3 stage. as shown previously
[6], control lwl3 larvae showed negligible gfp-ph labeling of
the plasma membrane (fig. 4a). in contrast, dor1 mutants
showed strong plasma membrane localization of gfp-ph at the
lwl3 stage (fig. 4b). expression of dor in a dor mutant
background restored the down-regulation (fig. 4c). taken
together, these results indicate that dor1 larvae do not undergo
the normal down-regulation of pi3k signaling at the wl3 stage.
dor1 mutants show impaired ecdysone response in the larval
fat body
the results from the pi3k signaling assay suggested that the
ecdysone signaling response could be impaired in the dor1 fat
body. to directly address whether the ecdysone response was
reduced, we employed a recently developed ecdysone reporter
system [30,34]. expression of a heat-shock-inducible gal4
driver that is activated through binding of ecdysone drives
the expression of uas-nlacz56 in tissues where ecdysone is

(3,4,5)p3 at the plasma membrane is visualized by a gfp-ph probe driven by a constitutive tubulindriver. lysotracker staining is
included to visualize autophagy. control fat body at the lwl3 stage (a) has down-regulated pi3k, and therefore no gfp-ph
localization at the plasma membrane. lysotracker staining shows the normal large autolysosomes present at this stage. in the
fat body from dor1/yhemizygous larvae (b), gfp-ph is present at the plasma membrane. lysotracker staining shows small
structures indicative of defective autophagy. the expression of dor in a dor1 mutant background restores normal
down-regulation (c). the inserts in panels a, b and c show overviews of the tissue. arrows mark the plasma membrane. (d–f)
ecdysone levels were monitored using a heat-shock-inducible construct hs-gal4-usp. this construct can activate uas-nlacz by
gal4 in the presence of ecdysone. (d) in wild-type fat body tissue where ecdysone signaling is normal, nuclei do express lacz as
detected by anti-β galactosidase antibodies. (e) in dor1/ylarval fat bodies, however, the expression of lacz is reduced, as
indicated by the virtual absence of lacz-positive nuclei. the asterisk marks the testis. frame (f) shows the background
expression and detection of the uas-nlacz construct alone.
present. interestingly, while activation of the reporter was
robust in the fat body of control animals, no such activation
was seen in dor1 mutants (figs. 4d, e). taken together with the
pi3k reporter assay, this suggests that the fat body of dor
mutant larvae does not experience sufficient amounts of
ecdysone signaling to induce pi3k down-regulation.
overexpression of pten in a dor1 background does not restore
autophagy in the fat body
if the dor1 phenotype were exclusively caused by the deficient
ecdysone signaling, overexpression of pten should mimic this
and restore autophagy levels in the dor1 fat body. to address
this, uas-pten was driven by cg-gal4 in a dor1 mutant
background and compared to cg-gal4;uas-pten in wild-type
background. overexpression of pten did not restore the
formation of gfp-lc3/lysotracker-positive structures (fig. 5).
this indicates that dor is also required autonomously in the fat
body for autophagy to take place. to verify these results, we
also studied the larvae by electron microscopy. the fat body
cells in these animals contain little cytoplasm, most probably
due to the early onset of autophagy, while maternal dor mrna
still was present and to reduced cell growth as a consequence
of decreased pi3k signaling [28]. importantly, however, pten
expressing dor1 mutant fat body cells still accumulated
autophagosomes, similar to dor1 larvae (fig. 5d). to test
directly whether autophagy in the dor1 larvae could be induced
by ecdysone, we fed early l3 dor1 larvae with ecdysone and
compared them with wild-type larvae. while exogenous
ecdysone induced autophagy in the fat body of wild-type
early l3 larvae, this was not the case with the wl3 dor1 larvae
(figs. 5e–h), consistent with the pten expression data.
collectively, these results indicate that dor larvae not only
are defective in ecdysone signaling, but also in the fusion
between autophagosomes and lysosomes.
the down-regulation of pi3k can be rescued by exogenous
ecdysone
the defective down-regulation of pi3k in the dor fat body could
be due to failure in either ecdysone signaling or tissue
responsiveness. the exogenous addition of ecdysone would
rescue the down-regulation of pi3k in dor larvae only if the
failure were caused by low ecdysone signaling. by feeding dor

larvae ecdysone and scoring for gfp-ph presence at the
plasma membrane, we tested the function of dor in ecdysone
signaling. feeding ecdysone to premature early l3 wild-type
larvae led to a down-regulation of pi3k activity, as expected
(figs. 6a, b). importantly ecdysone feeding also caused down-
regulation of pi3k activity in late wandering l3 dor mutant
larvae (fig. 6). this indicates that the dor defect in pi3k down-
regulation is due to failure in ecdysone signaling. the failure
in autophagosomal fusion with the lysosome and the
impaired ecdysone signaling are thus two separate defects of
dor mutants that contribute to the lack of programmed
autophagy in the fat body.
discussion
in this work, we have found that dor/vps18 is needed for
programmed autophagy in the drosophila larval fat body.
autophagosomes accumulate in dor1 fat body tissue, showing
that dor is needed for the fusion of autophagosomes with
lysosomes. we have also found that dor1 mutants display
lowered ecdysone reporter activity in the fat body and that
class i pi3k is not down-regulated properly, a sign of impaired
ecdysone signaling. consistently, the failure in down-regula-
tion of pi3k in dor mutants could be rescued by feeding the
larvae ecdysone. because previous work has shown that
ecdysone triggers autophagy, we conclude that dor controls
autophagy at two levels, both through ecdysone signaling and
through autophagosome–lysosome fusion.
to elucidate the separate functions of dor in autophagy, we
initially tested the starvation-induced autophagic capacity of
l2 dor mutant larvae. this proved difficult since both dor1 and
the stronger dor8 allele showed intact starvation-induced
autophagy at this stage (results not shown), likely due to
prolonged maternal contribution of the dor+ mrna. dor is,
however, clearly needed for the fusion event of autophagy in
the fat body. no restoration of autolysosome formation was
seen when overexpressing pten in a dor1 mutant background,
proving that dor is required autonomously in the fat body for
fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome. this is
further supported by recent work that showed that rnai
against dvps16, another component of the vps class c
in the drosophila eye leads to accumulation of
complex,
autophagosomes [35].
previous studies in several organisms, including drosophila,
have indicated that gfp-lc3 is a faithful marker of autophago-
somes. we were therefore surprised to discover that autopha-
gosomes that accumulated in the dor1 fat body mostly were
gfp-lc3-negative. this is probably due to the fact that lc3
dissociates from the outer membrane of the autophagosome

just before fusion with the lysosome [36–38] and that the
amount of gfp-lc3 present on the inner membrane is
insufficient to be visible by confocal microscopy. the gfp-
lc3-negative autophagosomes in dor1 mutants had probably
accumulated over time (see below), which would favor the
dissociation of membrane-associated gfp-lc3. the numerous
lysotracker-positive structures seen in dor1 mutants could
represent acidified autophagosomes but more likely corre-
spond to accumulated late endosomes, as previously de-
scribed [20,35]. the abundance of small lamp1-positive
structures in dor1 mutants supports this explanation.
as a consequence of increased ecdysone titer, pi3k signaling
in the fat body is normally down-regulated at the end of the
larval stage, thus triggering autophagy [6]. in contrast, pi3k
signaling in dor1 mutants was not down-regulated, which
suggested that ecdysone signaling might be defective in these
mutants. this was confirmed both by an ecdysone reporter
assay, which indicated that less ecdysone reached the fat body
nuclei in dor1 mutants [30,34], and by rescuing the down-
regulation by feeding ecdysone to the mutant larvae. given the
low ecdysone signaling in the dor1 fat body, we had expected to
observe a low number of autophagosomes even at late time
points during larval development. however, a substantial
number of autophagosomes could be observed in the dor1
mutants at the lwl3 stage. the finding that expression of a
dominant-negative ecdysone receptor did not lead to the
accumulation of autophagosomes in the fat body rules out
the possibility that ecdysone might be needed in a later step
than in the initiation of autophagy and that this is the reason
for the accumulation [6]. the detected autophagosomes are
thus likely to stem from low house-keeping levels of autop-
hagy, which would lead to an accumulation of autophago-
somes in dor1 mutants due to impaired fusion with lysosomes.
this is in accordance with the accumulation of autophago-
somes in vps16-deficient cells in the drosophila eye [35].
early work on dor mutants has investigated the puffing
patterns in the salivary gland polytene chromosomes [22,23].
interestingly, animals carrying lethal alleles of dor showed no
ecdysone-linked puffs in the l3 stage and incubating the
tissue with ecdysone could restore these puffs. the simplest
interpretation of these results is that the tissue itself is
responsive to the hormone but that ecdysone signaling is
impaired in the absence of dor. our present findings showing
that hypomorphic dor1 larvae experience lower ecdysone
reporter activity in the fat body and that the down-regulation
of pi3k is restored by feeding dor mutant larvae ecdysone
suggest that the fat body also is responsive to the hormone but
fails to down-regulate pi3k in dor1 larvae due to insufficient
ecdysone levels. the involvement of dor in ecdysone signaling
will be important to address in future studies.
given the importance of ecdysone for larval development,
it is perhaps surprising that dor1 mutants form pupae and even
hatch and develop into adult flies. the reason for this
apparent paradox could either be that there is some residual
ecdysone signaling in the dor1 mutants not detected by the
reporter assay or that the fat body is less responsive to the
hormone than other tissues. we also considered the possibil-
ity that dor1 mutants use an extended amount of time before
they pupariate in order to accumulate sufficiently high
ecdysone levels. however, this is unlikely to be the case as
the dor1 larvae pupariate at the correct time and give rise to
adult flies of normal size [39]. it has previously been shown
that autophagy is initiated even while the ecdysone levels are
quite low [6]. it is therefore conceivable that autophagy is
initiated to some extent in dor1 mutants but cannot propagate
due to low ecdysone levels and impaired fusion with the
lysosome. this is supported by the fact that autophagosome–
lysosome fusion in dor1 fat bodies can be rescued by
expression of dor in all tissues, but not by overexpression of
pten or by incubation with exogenous ecdysone.
in summary, we have provided evidence that dor/vps18 is
required for ecdysone signaling and thereby proper pi3k
down-regulation and for fusion between autophagosomes
and lysosomes in the drosophila fat body. taken together with
previous studies, this indicates that dor serves as both a
regulator and effector in autophagy. in further studies, it will
be interesting to examine whether this dual function is
particular for dor or whether also other subunits of the
hops complex play a similar bifunctional role.
