summary
the tumor suppressor functions of p19arf have been
attributed to its ability to induce cell cycle arrest or ap-
optosis by activating p53 and regulating ribosome bio-
genesis. here we describe another cellular function of
p19arf, involving a short isoform (smarf, short mito-
chondrial arf) that localizes to a proteinase k-resis-
tant compartment of the mitochondria. smarf is a
product of internal initiation of translation at met45,
which lacks the nucleolar functional domains. the hu-
man p14arf mrna likewise produces a shorter iso-
form. smarf is maintained at low levels via protea-
some-mediated degradation, but
increases in
response to viral and cellular oncogenes. ectopic ex-
pression of smarf reduces mitochondrial membrane
potential (djm) without causing cytochrome c re-
lease or caspase activation. the dissipation of djm
does not depend on p53 or bcl-2 family members.
smarf induces massive autophagy and caspase-in-
dependent cell death that can be partially rescued by
knocking down atg5 or beclin-1, suggesting a differ-
ent prodeath function for this short isoform.

introduction
the arf tumor suppressor protein (p19arf in mouse
and p14arf in human) is an activator of p53 that antago-
nizes the function of p53’s inhibitor, mdm2. arf inhibits
mdm2 by sequestrating it to the nucleolus (tao and lev-
ine, 1999; weber et al., 1999) and by inhibiting its e3 pro-
tein ubiquitin ligase activity (honda and yasuda, 1999;
midgley et al., 2000). arf is induced by oncoproteins
such as c-myc (zindy et al., 1998), e2f-1 (bates et al.,
1998), and b-catenin (damalas et al., 2001) and is thus
an important mediator in the activation of p53 in re-
sponse to oncogenes (lowe and sherr, 2003). yet, the
seminal ﬁnding that mice lacking p19arf, p53, and
mdm2 are more tumor prone than those lacking only
p53 and mdm2 raised the possibility that p19arf can
also act independently of the mdm2-p53 axis in tumor
surveillance (weber et al., 2000a). consistent with this
notion, studies performed in cell culture have shown
that the two cellular effects of p19arf, i.e., inhibition of
cell growth/proliferation and induction of apoptosis,
can also occur in a p53-mdm2-independent manner
(matsuoka et al., 2003; nakazawa et al., 2003; sugimoto
*correspondence: adi.kimchi@weizmann.ac.il
et al., 2003; suzuki et al., 2003; tsuji et al., 2002). the in-
hibitory functions on cellular growth have been associ-
ated with inhibition of rrna processing in the nucleolus
via physical interactions with nucleophosmin/b23 (bert-
wistle et al., 2004; sugimoto et al., 2003). yet, p53-inde-
pendent molecular mechanisms mediating the prodeath
mode of action of p19arf have not been thoroughly de-
termined.
the murine p19arf is composed of 169 amino acids, is
highly basic and hydrophobic, and localizes primarily to
nucleoli (weber et al., 1999). the human p14arf ortholog
is composed of only 132 amino acids and shares only
limited sequence homology with the mouse protein
(stott et al., 1998). yet, p14arf is also a basic and hydro-
phobic protein that often localizes predominantly to the
nucleolus (lohrum et al., 2000), and it retains all known
tumor suppressor functions of the mouse p19arf pro-
tein as well as p19arf’s capability to induce p53-inde-
pendent apoptosis (hemmati et al., 2002).
initiation of
here we report on a mitochondrial short form of
p19arf, designated smarf (short mitochondrial arf),
which results from internal
translation.
smarf causes dissipation of mitochondrial membrane
potential (djm), in a p53- and bcl-2-family-independent
manner, without releasing cytochrome c. it leads to the
induction of massive autophagy and to caspase-inde-
pendent cell death. notably, although the mouse and
the human arf mrna share only limited sequence ho-
mology, the ability to produce a shorter protein form is
preserved between the orthologs, emphasizing the im-
portance of this arf isoform.
results
internal initiation of translation generates a short
form of p19arf
the murine p19arf is composed of 169 amino acids
(figure 1a). in addition to the full-length protein, ectopic
expression of p19arf-flag cdna in 293t cells gave rise
to a shorter, faster migrating form, which we designated
smarf (figure 1b). the levels of smarf corresponded
to about 1%–5% of total p19arf protein. it should be
noted that this form was detected only under gel condi-
tions that efﬁciently resolved low-molecular-weight pro-
teins, which may explain why smarf has not been pre-
viously reported. smarf was detected by western
blotting with either anti-flag or anti-p19arf antibodies
(figures 1b and 1c), indicating that smarf contains
an intact c terminus. it was also present when cells
were directly lysed in sample loading buffer (figure 1c),
excluding the possibility that smarf is a degradation
product generated during the extraction procedure.
one mechanism that may account for the formation of
smarf is translation from an internal initiation site. in
fact, the p19arf mrna sequence contains a single addi-
tional met at position 45 (figure 1a), which potentially
could function as an internal initiation site. expression
of a plasmid in which met1 was converted to ile
(p19arf m1i) resulted in abundant production of a
protein product whose electrophoretic mobility was

gels using anti-p19arf antibodies.

m2-flag beads. the migration of the in vitro-translated polypeptides was compared to that of proteins extracted from transfected cells.

identical to that of smarf, with almost no full-length
p19arf evident (figure 1d). in contrast, conversion of
met45 to ile (p19arf m45i) abolished almost completely
the presence of smarf, even though full-length p19arf
was produced efﬁciently (figure 1d). as expected, sub-
stitution of both met1 and met45 by ile abolished the ex-
pression of both isoforms (data not shown). deletion of
the ﬁrst 40 amino acids of p19arf generated a protein
product with the same gel migration proﬁle as the prod-
uct of m1i (dnp19arf, figure 1d). in vitro translation in
reticulocyte lysates further conﬁrmed the existence of
internal translation initiation. in vitro translation from
the full-length p19arf mrna gave rise to two protein
products. the shorter form had the same electropho-
retic mobility on gels as the translation product of the
dnp19arf plasmid (figure 1e, right panel) and as protein
product expressed from this plasmid in transfected cells
(compare left to right panel in figure 1e). interestingly, in
the in vitro reaction, both proteins were produced in
equal proportions, suggesting that translation from the
second met is as efﬁcient as from the ﬁrst. however,
in vivo, the short form comprises only a small fraction
of the total. thus, there must be additional regulatory
mechanisms that inﬂuence translation rates or protein
stability in vivo. a plasmid in which met45 was con-
verted to ala (m45a) failed to produce smarf upon
in vitro translation (data not shown). taken together,
the data suggest that the p19arf open reading frame
contains two initiation sites and that the primary mech-
anism for smarf production is internal
initiation of
translation at met45.
this short form was also endogenously expressed in
nontransfected cells. as shown in figure 1f, the anti-
p19arf antibodies recognized a short p19arf form that
was present at low levels (compared to the full-length
protein) in cells under steady-state growth conditions.
this band was apparent in primary and immortalized
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (i.e.,
in early passage
[p2] of wt mef cultures and in 35-8 cells that are mef-
derived immortalized cells that lack p53) but not in
nih3t3 cells which lack the ink4a/arf locus. as ex-
pected, the electrophoretic mobility of the endogenous

(a) 35-8 cells were treated with cycloheximide (20 mg/ml) for the indicated times or remained untreated. the expression levels of p19arf forms
were compared by western blotting using p19arf antibody on 12% sds-page.
(b) cells were treated with both cycloheximide and the proteasome inhibitor mg132 (100 mm) for the indicated times. cell lysates were analyzed
as described for (a).
smarf was a bit faster than that of the recombinant
flag-tagged smarf (compare figures 1c and 1f; the
common nonspeciﬁc band can be used as an internal
size reference).
notably, smarf levels were elevated in response to
ectopic expression of viral and cellular oncogenes. in
sv40-transformed mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts, the ex-
pression of smarf increased more than 10-fold (fig-
ure 1f, right panel). additionally, introduction of two cel-
lular oncoproteins, e2f-1 and c-myc,
into p53 null
primary mefs (p5) or into the 35-8 cell line led to an in-
crease in smarf protein levels of 1.5- to 3-fold
(figure 1g). this moderate yet reproducible increase
was also detected at the level of the p19arf full-length
protein, consistent with previous reports (bates et al.,
1998; zindy et al., 1998). thus, the two isoforms of
p19arf are subjected to upregulation in response to hy-
perproliferative signals of cellular and viral oncogenes.
smarf is a short-lived protein that is degraded
by the proteasome
we next examined whether the relative low steady-state
levels of smarf are due to differences in the protein
turnover. to this end, the stability of the two p19arf
forms following administration of cycloheximide was
measured in the 35-8 cells. notably, after as little as 10
min, smarf protein expression levels were already re-
duced, while the full-length p19arf protein expression
levels remained almost unchanged even after several
hours of cycloheximide treatment (figure 2a). thus,
smarf is a short-lived protein with a half-life of less
than 1 hr, in contrast to the much more stable full-length
p19arf, which has been reported to display a half-life
of w6 hr (kuo et al., 2004). furthermore, the proteasome
inhibitor mg132 signiﬁcantly inhibited the turnover of
smarf (figure 2b), indicating that smarf’s low steady-
state levels are maintained by proteasome-mediated
degradation. the signiﬁcant difference in the turnover
rates of the two translational products of arf may ex-
plain why the ratio of smarf to full-length p19arf is
much lower in cells than in in vitro translation systems.
of note, in the sv40-transformed ﬁbroblasts shown in
figure 1f, the half-life of smarf was 2-fold greater
than in the p53 null ﬁbroblasts (data not shown).
the human p14arf mrna also produces a shorter
unstable protein that is translated from an internal
atg
the human arf mrna also contains an internal met at
position 48 (figure 3a). in fact, in vitro translation of wt
p14arf in reticulocyte lysate gave rise to two protein
products, the ﬁrst corresponding to the full-length pro-
tein and the second to a faster migrating protein desig-
nated hsmarf (human smarf) that might correspond
to translation initiation from met 48 (figure 3b). in vitro
translation of a plasmid in which met 1 was converted
to ala resulted in production of a protein product whose
electrophoretic mobility was identical
to that of
hsmarf, with almost no full-length p14arf evident
(figure 3b). in contrast, conversion of met 48 to ala sig-
niﬁcantly reduced the expression of hsmarf (data not
shown). however, hsmarf was barely detectable in
293t cells upon transfection with the wt p14arf plasmid,
unless the proteasome inhibitor mg132 was added. re-
markably, after 17 hr of treatment with mg132, steady-
state levels of hsmarf approached those of
the
full-length p14arf (figures 3c and 3d). these results in-
dicate that the hsmarf’s rapid turnover is mediated by
the proteasome, even more efﬁciently than the murine
smarf. hsmarf was detected by western blotting
with either anti-flag (figures 3c and 3d) or anti-p14arf
antibodies (data not shown), indicating that it contains
an intact c terminus. as expected, expression of a p14
m1a plasmid in mg132-treated 293t cells resulted in
abundant production of a protein product whose elec-
trophoretic mobility was identical to that of hsmarf,
with almost no full-length p14arf evident. thus, the pro-
duction and controlled degradation of a short, internally
initiated translation product are conserved properties of
both the murine p19arf and human p14arf orthologs.
this feature is not limited to human and mouse; the rat

also produced a short form that was readily detectable
only upon proteasome inhibition (figure 3e).
smarf localizes to mitochondria
two segments of p19arf, namely residues 1–14 and 26–
37, have been shown to be critical for the established
functions of p19arf, i.e., nucleolar localization, mdm2
binding, and p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (weber
et al., 2000b) (see also figure 1a). additionally, the ﬁrst
14 amino acids were recently shown to be essential for
arf-mediated inhibition of ribosomal rna processing
(sugimoto et al., 2003), most probably through interac-
tion with nucleophosmin/b23 (bertwistle et al., 2004; ita-
hana et al., 2003). since smarf lacks all these important
functional domains, it may localize to other cellular com-
partments and function differently. to determine the lo-
calization of smarf, hela cells were transiently trans-
fected with p19arf m1i, which mainly expresses
smarf, and were immunostained with anti-flag anti-
bodies. surprisingly, all
transfected cells exhibited
strong punctate cytoplasmic staining, and in most of
the transfectants (>75%), no nucleolar staining was evi-
dent (figure 4a, upper panels). to determine the nature
of the punctate staining, the p19arf m1i plasmid was co-
transfected with the mito-dsred plasmid, which targets
a red ﬂuorescent protein speciﬁcally to the mitochondria
due to its fusion with a mitochondrial targeting se-
quence. a perfect overlap between the anti-flag stain-
ing and the mito-dsred signal was observed (figure 4a),
indicating that smarf localizes to mitochondria. smarf
mitochondrial localization was also conﬁrmed by confo-
cal microscopy (data not shown). notably, while hela
cells cotransfected with luciferase, gfp, and mito-
dsred plasmids exhibited the typical spread and tubu-
lar morphology of mitochondria (figure 4a,
lower
panels), the morphology of the mitochondria in cells ex-
pressing smarf was abnormal; they were condensed,
rounded, and clustered in the perinuclear region (fig-
ure 4a). to conﬁrm that
the endogenous smarf
detected at low levels in 35-8 mefs (see figure 1f)
also localizes to the mitochondria, these cells were
costained with anti-p19arf and anti-cytochrome c anti-
bodies. signiﬁcantly, positive mitochondrial staining
could be detected in a small fraction of the cells, in ad-
dition to the expected, much more prominent nucleolar
staining of the full-length protein (figure 4b). the stain-
ing was speciﬁc since no mitochondrial staining could
be detected with the same antibodies in nih3t3 cells
that do not express any p19arf (figure 4b).
in order to conﬁrm the mitochondrial localization of
smarf by another approach, mitochondria were sepa-
rated from the nuclear and cytosolic fractions by differ-
ential centrifugation. the biochemical cell fractionations
were performed in 35-8 cells to assess endogenous pro-
teins and in 293t cells transfected with dnp19arf to as-
sess ectopically expressed smarf; p19arf m45a was
used as a control. proteinase k, a nonspeciﬁc serine
protease that cannot penetrate mitochondrial mem-
branes, was used to determine whether smarf is pres-
ent inside the mitochondria or associates with the outer
surface of the organelle. both endogenous and exoge-
nous smarf were detected predominantly in the pro-
teinase k-resistant compartment of the mitochondria
(figures 4c and 4d). smarf was subjected to degrada-
tion upon addition of the detergent triton-x (figure 4d).
this pattern of resistance to proteinase k was similar to
that of cytochrome c (figure 4d, left bottom lane), sug-
gesting that smarf is an intramitochondrial protein. in
contrast, bcl-xl and bcl-2, which are surface mitochon-
drial proteins, were completely exposed to proteinase k
even in the absence of detergent and therefore were
completely proteolyzed (figure 4d, right lanes). of
note, a minor portion of full-length p19arf was present
in the mitochondrial preparations (figure 4c) and, in
contrast to smarf, was sensitive to proteinase k diges-
tion (w80% digestion, figure 4d). therefore, it is possi-
ble that the presence of full-length p19arf reﬂects non-
speciﬁc contamination of the mitochondrial fraction,
a short mitochondrial form of p19arf

(a) hela cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently cotransfected with mito-dsred and either p19arf m1i or luciferase and gfp. after 24 hr,

(b) a fraction of endogenous p19arf also exhibits mitochondrial staining. 35-8 and nih3t3 cells were immunostained with anti-p19arf and anti-

(c) smarf localizes within the mitochondria. cellular extracts from 35-8 and 293t cells transfected with dnp19arf or p19arf m45a were frac-
tionated into nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions (40 mg of each fraction of 35-8 cells per lane and 25 mg of each fraction of 293t trans-
fectants per lane). note that the nuclear fraction was contaminated with unlysed cells. the enriched mitochondrial fraction was subjected to pro-
teinase k treatment (1 mg/ml). to assess the purity of the fractions, mthsp70 and a-tubulin were used as markers for the mitochondria and
cytoplasm, respectively.
(d) the enriched mitochondrial fraction from 35-8 cells (100 mg per lane) was assayed before and after proteinase k treatment, in the presence or
absence of triton x-100 as indicated, and western blotted for p19arf, cytochrome c, bcl-xl, and bcl-2.

a short mitochondrial form of p19arf
469
while smarf’s resistance to proteinase k indicates that
it is a genuine resident of the mitochondria.
smarf causes dissipation of djm
to assess possible effects of smarf on mitochondrial
function, a ﬂuorescent mitochondrial dye, mitotracker
red (cmx-ros, molecular probes), which accumulates
only in actively respiring mitochondria that have an in-
tact djm, was used. hela and nih3t3 cells expressing
either wt p19arf or dnp19arf were stained with mito-
tracker red, ﬁxed, and then immunostained with anti-
flag antibodies. surprisingly, nearly 100% of cells trans-
fected with the dnp19arf plasmid lacked mitotracker
dye uptake, while nontransfected neighboring cells ex-
hibited strong mitotracker staining (figure 5a). unlike
the dnp19arf-expressing cells, the adjacent nontrans-
fected cells displayed the typical spread and tubular
morphology of mitochondria. these observations sug-
gested that smarf not only impairs the structure of
the mitochondria but also dramatically dissipates
djm. these data were compared to the outcome of
transfections with the wt p19arf plasmid, which ex-
presses high levels of full-length p19arf and small
amounts of smarf. as expected, most of the cells dis-
played the typical p19arf nucleolar staining and strong
mitotracker staining, suggesting that djm in these
transfectants was not impaired (figure 5a). yet,
in
a small fraction of the transfected cells, mainly those
displaying the highest p19arf expression levels, extra-
nuclear staining was evident in addition to the nucleolar
distribution; in some of those cells, mitotracker uptake
was reduced (figure 5a). this further supports the con-
clusion that
the mitochondrial presence of smarf
causes dissipation of djm. figure 5b shows a quantita-
tive comparison of the extent of loss of djm in nih3t3
cells expressing full-length p19arf, dnp19arf, or p19arf
m45a. the proportion of cells exhibiting reduced djm
correlated with the levels of smarf produced:
dnp19arf, which produces large amounts of the short
form only, caused loss of mitotracker staining in nearly
100% of transfected cells, while djm was intact in most
of the cells transfected with p19arf m45a, which ex-
presses almost exclusively full-length p19arf. an inter-
mediate phenotype (30%) was observed with the wt
p19arf plasmid, which is capable of producing both
forms. thus, these experiments imply that smarf, but
not full-length p19arf, is capable of mediating the re-
duction in djm and that the ectopically expressed
smarf has to exceed some threshold levels in order
to damage the mitochondria. to conﬁrm that the loss
of mitotracker red staining was in fact a result of
smarf-mediated reduction in djm, ﬂow cytometric
analysis of transfected nih3t3 cells stained with the mi-
tochondrial probe dioc6 was performed. facs analysis
was performed on the entire cell population (w50%
transfection efﬁciency). smarf caused a complete
loss of djm in 39.1% of the total cells (i.e., in most of
the transfectants) (figure 5c). thus, two independent
experimental methods prove that smarf induces dissi-
pation of the djm. despite loss of djm at 24 hr, cyto-
chrome c was not released from the mitochondria in the
majority of cells (figure 5d), indicating that the outer mi-
tochondrial membrane was intact. notably, hsmarf
was also detected in the mitochondria and caused dissi-
pation of the djm (data not shown).
smarf damages djm in a p53- and
bcl-2-independent manner
in order to test whether smarf’s function is coupled to
the known mitochondrial signaling pathways that in-
volve p53 and the bcl-2 family proteins, the mitochon-
drial effect of smarf was assessed in the presence
and absence of these regulators. it was found that
smarf was also capable of reducing the djm in the
35-8 mef-derived cell
is p53 deﬁcient
(figure 5e), indicating that p53 is not required for the mi-
tochondrial effects of this p19arf form. introduction of
dnp19arf into bax/bak double null mefs likewise re-
sulted in dissipation of djm (figure 5e). furthermore,
smarf’s ability to dissipate djm was not impaired by
overexpressing either bcl-2 or bcl-xl (figure 5f). this
indicates that smarf damages the mitochondrial mem-
brane in a manner that involves neither p53 nor the bcl-2
family.

smarf induces autophagy and caspase-
independent cell death

pression, 293t cells were transfected with dnp19arf
and were further analyzed at 48 hr. cells transfected
with control plasmid reached near conﬂuency (fig-
ure 6a). in contrast, culture dishes transfected with
dnp19arf contained many rounded, ﬂoating, dying
cells, similar to cultures that were transfected with
tnfr-1 (p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor-1), which
triggers typical caspase-dependent cell death (fig-
ure 6a). the drop in cell survival
in response to
dnp19arf transfection was further quantiﬁed at 72 hr

levels of ﬂuorescent intensities: m1 cells with dramatic reduction in djm, m2 cells with an intermediate state of djm, and m3 cells with intact
djm. note that the transfection efﬁciency, as determined by the percent of gfp-positive cells, was 50%, but the entire cell population, com-
prising both transfected and nontransfected cells, was analyzed.

and compared to the outcome of transfection with
tnfr-1. two independent viability assays were used,
the neutral red dye uptake assay and a second sensi-
tive assay that measures cellular luciferase activity in vi-
able cells. as shown in figure 6b, smarf reduced cell
viability to a similar extent as tnfr-1. in parallel, the ex-
tent of cell death was directly measured by trypan blue
staining. a signiﬁcant increase in the percent of trypan
blue-positive cells was observed in dnp19arf transfec-
tants, similar to the extent of cell death induced by
tnfr-1 (figure 6b, right panel). yet, molecular analysis
revealed that the type of cell death is different in each
case. western blot analysis of parp-1 and caspase-3
cleavage conﬁrmed that tnfr-1 induced classical apo-
ptotic cell death involving caspase activation (fig-
ure 6c). smarf, in contrast, induced caspase-indepen-
dent cell death, which was not accompanied by parp-1
or caspase-3 cleavage (figure 6c) and which was not
blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zvad-fmk (data
not shown). although mitochondrial function was im-
paired by smarf (figure 5), atp production was main-
tained in these cells (data not shown), probably by gly-
colysis, suggesting that cell death is not a result of
atp depletion.
further characterization of the cell death phenotype
suggested that smarf activates autophagy. this was
ﬁrst assessed by examining the localization of gfp-
tagged lc3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3). vesicular accumulation of lc3 is a marker of
autophagy, as recruitment of modiﬁed lc3 to the na-
scent autophagic vesicle is an early event in autophago-
some formation (kabeya et al., 2000). to this end, the
gfp-tagged lc3 plasmid was coexpressed with either
an irrelevant control plasmid or with dnp19arf or
tnfr-1 plasmids. diffuse cytoplasmic localization of
gfp-lc3 was observed when it was expressed together
with the control or with the tnfr-1 plasmids, whereas
around 60% of the cells that expressed smarf showed
punctate ﬂuorescent staining indicative of autophagic
vesicles (figure 6d). furthermore, the number of auto-
phagic cells showing punctate staining of lc3 was not
signiﬁcantly reduced upon administration of the pan-
caspase inhibitor zvad-fmk (figure 6e). the presence
of autophagic vesicles was further conﬁrmed by exami-
nation of 293t transfectants by transmission em (tem).
as expected, in control-transfected cells, autophagic
vesicles were rarely observed (figure 6fa). in contrast,
numerous double membrane-enclosed vesicles sur-
rounding cytoplasmic matter and organelles appeared
in dnp19arf-transfected cells (figures 6fb–6fg).
to determine the relative kinetics with which the dif-
ferent smarf-induced events occurred, 293t cells
were cotransfected with dnp19arf together with gfp-
lc3 and were stained with mitotracker red at the indi-
cated times. most of the cells (96%) exhibited reduced
djm as early as 24 hr after transfection (figure 6g). in
contrast, autophagic vesicles accumulated more slowly.
punctate localization of gfp-lc3 was ﬁrst observed at
24 hr in 47% of the cells and reached a value of 61% after
48 hr (figure 6g). thus, the disruption of djm clearly
precedes the development of autophagy in smarf-
expressing cells.
knockdown of endogenous autophagic proteins
protects against smarf-induced cell death
recent studies have documented several scenarios in
which induction of autophagy triggers cell death (mills
et al., 2004; shimizu et al., 2004; yu et al., 2004) while
in many other cellular settings autophagy is cytoprotec-
tive (reviewed by gozuacik and kimchi [2004]). to as-
sess the involvement of autophagy in smarf-induced
cell death, shrna plasmids were generated to target
two key mediators of autophagosome formation, atg5
and beclin-1. atg5 is part of a ubiquitin-like pathway
necessary for the formation of the autophagic vesicle.
it is covalently conjugated to atg12, enabling the for-
mation of a large multiprotein complex that is recruited
to the nascent autophagosomal membrane (mizushima
et al., 2001). beclin-1 is a regulator of a class iii phospha-
tidylinositol 3-kinase complex, which is involved in the
nucleation of the autophagosomes (liang et al., 1999).
both atg5 and beclin-1 protein levels were partially re-
duced upon transfection with the shrna constructs
(figure 7a). the reduction in protein expression was
functionally signiﬁcant since, as expected, the atg5 or
beclin-1 shrnas partially reduced autophagosome for-
mation by amino acid deprivation (figure 7b). to assess
the effect of atg5 or beclin-1 reductions on smarf-in-
duced autophagy, 293t cells in which atg5 or beclin-1
was knocked down were cotransfected with gfp-lc3
and dnp19arf. it was found that the extent of autophagy
induced by smarf was partially reduced by knocking
down either atg5 or beclin-1 in a statistically signiﬁcant
manner (figure 7c). to determine whether autophagy is
causative to the smarf-induced cell death, or is rather
a cytoprotective mechanism, we measured the outcome
of knockdown of atg5 or beclin-1 on cell viability. to
this end, 293-luc cells in which atg5 or beclin-1 protein
levels were reduced by the shrna plasmids were sub-
sequently transfected with control or dnp19arf plas-
mids, and the survival assay was performed 72 hr later.
it was found that the knockdown of the autophagic pro-
teins attenuated rather than increased the ability of
smarf to induce cell death (figure 7d). this result
was obtained repeatedly in three independent experi-
ments. western blotting conﬁrmed that equal levels of
smarf were expressed in all transfectants (figure 7a).
thus, the massive autophagy that is induced by smarf
positively contributes to the cell death process.

uncharacterized translation product, smarf, which re-
sults from internal initiation at met45. this form lacks
the n-terminal region encompassing the domains re-
quired for the various nucleolar functions of p19arf
and, instead, translocates to a proteinase k-resistant
compartment of the mitochondria.
in healthy cells,
smarf accumulates to low steady-state levels, due to
its rapid turnover, and thus is not harmful to cells.
forced expression of this form, however, leads to dissi-
pation of the djm and ultimately to autophagic vesicle
formation and caspase-independent cell death.
smarf causes the dissipation of the inner membrane
potential by a mechanism that does not involve the dif-
ferent bcl-2 family members that were examined. fur-
thermore, no signs of cytochrome c release into the cy-
toplasm and subsequent caspase activation were
detected, suggesting that the outer membrane is not
damaged by smarf. thus smarf does not trigger
type i caspase-dependent cell death. instead, smarf
induced the formation of autophagosomes. autophagy
can be used by cells to protect them from adverse con-
ditions or alternatively may lead to their ﬁnal destruction
(reviewed by gozuacik and kimchi [2004]). the electron
microscopy studies performed here showed that
smarf induces a large number of autophagosomes in
cells, which engulf different intracellular components in-
cluding mitochondria, er, and bulk cytoplasm. knock-
ing down two important elements in the autophagy
pathways, atg5 and beclin-1, partially compromised
both autophagic activity and cell death, implying that
autophagy is necessary for smarf-induced cell death.
several studies suggest that damaged mitochondria
may be a trigger for the induction of autophagy (elmore
et al., 2001; rodriguez-enriquez et al., 2004). in particu-
lar, in yeast grown under nonstarvation conditions, au-
tophagy can be induced by impairing the mitochondrial
electrochemical transmembrane potential (priault et al.,
2005). thus, it is possible, although not yet proven, that
the smarf-induced mitochondrial depolarization may
signal the induction of autophagic vesicle formation.
since atp levels were not reduced in smarf-express-
ing cells, it is unlikely that the signaling operates through
induction of amp kinase (ampk) and mtor inhibition.
ectopic expression of cellular and viral oncogenes led
to elevation of smarf protein levels, suggesting that
both the nucleolar full-length p19arf and the mitochon-
drial short form are regulated by oncogenes. the exis-
tence of these two isoforms of p19arf may thus enable
hyperproliferative signals to activate two concurrent
pathways that may both contribute to the cell’s defen-
sive response to transformation. the ﬁrst pathway in-
volves the known nucleolar functions of the full-length
protein, i.e., regulation of p53 stability and activity by
binding to mdm2 (honda and yasuda, 1999; midgley
et al., 2000; tao and levine, 1999; weber et al., 1999)
and interference with the processing and maturation of
a short mitochondrial form of p19arf
473
preribosomal rna, thereby restraining protein synthesis
and cell growth (bertwistle et al., 2004; itahana et al.,
2003; sugimoto et al., 2003). the second pathway, acti-
vated by the short form, utilizes a mitochondria-based
mechanism to induce autophagy and caspase-indepen-
dent cell death. this mitochondrial pathway may act as
a back-up to the nuclear pathway, particularly in circum-
stances when p53 and/or the caspase-dependent apo-
ptotic pathway are nonfunctional.
it is noteworthy that in response to dna damage,
a fraction of p53 may also localize to the mitochondria
and activate a mitochondrial-based death pathway,
yet by a different mechanism that involves bcl-2 family
members (mihara et al., 2003). furthermore, p53 was re-
cently linked to autophagy by activating ampk and in-
hibiting mtor activity upon glucose deprivation and is
also a target for activation by ampk (feng et al., 2005;
jones et al., 2005). however, those mechanisms do
not appear to bear any relationship to the arf activity
described in the present study.
notably, the human p14arf ortholog is also capable of
producing hsmarf, which can localize to and impair the
mitochondria, despite its retention of a second nucleolar
localization signal (weber et al., 2000b). thus the mito-
chondrial function of arf is conserved between the dis-
parate human and mouse orthologs. a comparison of
sequence databases revealed, however, that while the
human, mouse, and hamster genes all have a second
met at a similar position, there is no corresponding
met in the published sequences from other species
such as rat, opossum, and pig. yet, expression of the
cdna for rat p19arf produced a shorter form of the pro-
tein in the presence of proteasome inhibition, similar to
what was observed for the human protein. thus, while
it is likely that the rat ortholog utilizes another mecha-
nism to generate its short form, the production of
smarf is conserved among mammals, suggesting
that this form serves an essential cellular function.
in summary, an already complex picture involving the
existence of alternative reading frames of the ink4a/
arf locus has now become even more exciting with
the discovery of an alternative translation product of
the arf mrna. the interesting activities associated
with this short arf isoform may in fact be critical to
arf’s tumor suppressor function.
experimental procedures
dna constructs, transfections, and infections
all cell lines were grown as previously described (cohen et al., 1997;
raveh et al., 2001). 293t and hela cells were transiently transfected
by the standard calcium phosphate technique. nih3t3 cells, 35-8
cells, and bax/bak double knockout immortalized mefs were tran-
siently transfected with lipofectamine (invitrogen). retroviral medi-
ated infections were performed as previously described (cohen
et al., 1997; raveh et al., 2001). to induce autophagy by amino
acid deprivation, cells were washed twice with pbs and then incu-
bated in earle’s balanced salt solution (ebss, biological industries)
for 3 hr at 37ºc. p19arf and p14arf were expressed from pcdna3
plasmids tagged at their c terminus with the flag epitope. methio-
nine substitution mutants were generated by site-directed mutagen-
esis (quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit, stratagene). rat
p19arf was cloned from a rat bladder cdna library (kind gift of n. de-
kel, weizmann institute of science) by pcr using primers corre-
sponding to accession number ay679727, with a flag tag at the 30
end of the cdna. to generate psuper-based shrna vectors tar-
geting beclin-1, atg5, and hcred (control), 19-mer oligos corre-
sponding to nucleotides 1339–1357 of beclin-1 (accession number
nm003766), 779–797 of atg5 (accession number nm004849)
(boya et al., 2005), and 99–117 of hcred (accession number
af363776) were annealed and ligated into the bglii and hindiii of
the psuper vector (brummelkamp et al., 2002). myc and e2f-1
were produced from pbabe-puro-derived retroviruses that were
used to infect cells under puromycin selection conditions as previ-
ously described (raveh et al., 2001). cells were viewed live on an in-
verted ix70 microscope (olympus) equipped with a cplan 103 ob-
jective (n.a. 0.25) and a dvc digital camera (digital video camera
co.). images were captured using the c-view v2.1 imaging program
and processed with adobe photoshop.
protein analysis
cell lysis, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting were done as
previously described (raveh et al., 2001). proteins were separated
on 10%, 12%, or 15% sds-page. the following monoclonal anti-
bodies were used: anti flag, anti a-tubulin, and anti actin (sigma);
anti c-myc, anti e2f-1, and anti bcl-2 (santa cruz biotechnology);
anti cytochrome c (bd biosciences); and anti parp (biomol). poly-
clonal antibodies to p19arf (abcam); mitochondrial hsp70/grp75,
bcl-xl, and beclin-1 (santa cruz biotechnology); cleaved caspase-3
(cell signaling); and atg5 (a generous gift from n. mizushima) were
used. detection was done by either hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (jackson immunoresearch),
followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (supersignal, pierce)
in vitro transcription and translation assay
wt p19arf, p19arf mutant, wt p14arf, and p14arf mutant plasmids
were used as templates for coupled in vitro transcription/translation
from the t7 promoter (tnt reticulocyte lysate systems, promega)
by conventional procedures, using a complete amino acid mixture.
the reaction products were immunoprecipitated with m2-flag
beads and then subjected to western blot analysis on 12% or, where
indicated, 15% gels.
analysis of protein stability in vivo
the turnover of the endogenous smarf in 35-8 cells was monitored
by western blot analysis of cell extracts following the addition of
20 mg/ml cycloheximide (sigma). in addition, when indicated, the
proteasome inhibitor mg132 (calbiochem; 10 mm or 100 mm) was
included.
cell fractionation and proteinase k sensitivity assays
cell pellets were suspended in isotonic him buffer (200 mm manni-
tol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm egta, 10 mm hepes [ph 7.5]) with pro-
tease inhibitors, incubated 10 min on ice, homogenized by multiple
passages through a 25g needle, and centrifuged at 300 3 g at 4ºc
for 10 min to pellet the nuclear fraction. to reduce the amount of un-
lysed cells in the nuclear fraction, the homogenization procedure
was repeated twice in the nuclear fraction. the ﬁnal pellets were ex-
tracted with plb buffer containing protease inhibitors (nuclear frac-
tion). the supernatant (s1) was recentrifuged at 10,000 3 g at 4ºc for
10 min to pellet mitochondria, and the supernatant was saved as the
cytosolic fraction. unless indicated otherwise, the crude mitochon-
dria fraction was resuspended in him buffer and treated for 30 min
with proteinase k (0.1 or 1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of tri-
ton x-100 (1% ﬁnal concentration). proteolysis was stopped by the
addition of 5 nm pmsf. the mitochondrial pellets were extracted
with plb buffer containing protease inhibitors to give the mitochon-
drial fraction.
immunostaining
wt p19arf and derived mutants were transfected into hela, nih3t3,
35-8, 293t cells, or bax/bak double knockout mefs grown on glass
coverslips. when indicated, after 24 hr the cells were treated with
100 nm mitotracker dye (cmx-ros, molecular probes) in growth
medium for 30 min at 37ºc and then ﬁxed and permeabilized by sub-
sequent incubations in 3.7% formaldehyde, methanol, and acetone.
cells were then permeabilized/blocked with 0.4% triton-x 100
(sigma) in 10% normal goat serum (biological industries) and incu-
bated for 1 hr with mouse anti-flag antibodies (sigma), followed
by fitc-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies
molecular cell
474
(jackson immunoresearch) or rabbit polyclonal anti-flag (sigma),
followed by rhodamine-redx (rrx)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
(jackson immunoresearch). to stain endogenous p19arf, 35-8
cells and nih3t3 cells were permeabilized with 0.5% triton-x-100
in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 5 min and then ﬁxed with para-
formaldehyde for 20 min. cells were incubated with antibodies to
p19arf (abcam) or cytochrome c (bd biosciences) and then incu-
bated with cy-2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies or rho-
damine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (jackson immu-
noresearch). cells were ﬁnally stained with dapi
(0.5 mg/ml,
sigma). to visualize autophagosomes, 293t cells grown on glass
coverslips in the presence or absence of 100 mm zvad-fmk (sigma)
were cotransfected with 1 mg gfp-lc3 and 9 mg luciferase,
dnp19arf, or tnfr-1 expression plasmids. stained cells were
viewed by ﬂuorescent microscopy (olympus bx41) with 603 (n.a.
1.25) or 1003 (n.a. 1.3) uplan-fl oil immersion objectives, and digital
images were obtained with a dp50 ccd camera using viewﬁnder-
lite and studiolite software (olympus). composites and merged
images were generated in photoshop (adobe systems).
flow cytometric analysis of djm
perturbations in djm were monitored by ﬂow cytometry. trans-
fected nih3t3 cells were collected in culture medium by trypsiniza-
tion and stained with 40 nm 3,30dihexyloxacarbocyanine (dioc6,
sigma) for 30 min at 37ºc. samples were then analyzed by a facs-
can cytometer (becton dickinson), using an excitation laser of 488
nm and emission ﬁlter of 530/30 nm.
viability assays
for the neutral red assay, 293t cells were transfected with control
(cat), dnp19arf, or tnfr-1 plasmids, and cell viability was mea-
sured via the uptake of the vital dye neutral red (sigma) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. for the luciferase-based survival
assay, a monoclonal population of 293 cells stably transfected with
pcdna3-luciferase was generated by g418 selection (293-luc). 293-
luc cells were then transfected with control (cat), dnp19arf, or
tnfr-1 plasmids. for some experiments, cells were transfected 2
days in advance with shrna plasmids. cell viability was assessed
by measuring luciferase activity (promega) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions, using an anthos lucy3 microplate luminom-
eter. the overall cell survival in the shrna experiments was deter-
mined by dividing the mean luciferase activity (from triplicates) of
cells transfected with dnp19arf by the mean activity of cells trans-
fected with control (cat) for each knockdown experiment. for try-
pan blue staining, 293t cells were transfected with control (cat),
dnp19arf, or tnfr-1 plasmids, and cell death was measured by
uptake of trypan blue (sigma) into cells that had lost membrane
integrity.
transmission electron microscope
293t cells were transfected with luciferase (control) or dnp19arf
plasmids. cells were ﬁxed for 1 hr in karnovsky’s ﬁxative (3% para-
formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mm cacl2 in 0.1 m cacodylate
buffer [ph 7.4], containing 0.1 m sucrose). cells were scraped, pel-
leted, and embedded with agar noble to a ﬁnal concentration of
1.7% and postﬁxed with 1% oso4, 0.5% potassium dichromate,
and 0.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer.
the pellet was stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate fol-
lowed by ethanol dehydration and embedded in embed (ems). sec-
tions (75 nm) were cut, stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% etha-
nol and lead citrate, and examined using a fei cm12 eindhoven
transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of
120 kv. digital images were obtained with megaview3 ccd camera
(sis gmbh).
