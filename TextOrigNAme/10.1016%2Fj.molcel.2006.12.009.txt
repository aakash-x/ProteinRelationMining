summary
macroautophagy is an evolutionary conserved
lysosomal pathway involved in the turnover of
cellular macromolecules and organelles.
in
spite of its essential role in tissue homeostasis,
the molecular mechanisms regulating mamma-
lian macroautophagy are poorly understood.
here, we demonstrate that a rise in the free
cytosolic calcium ([ca2+]c) is a potent inducer
of macroautophagy. various ca2+ mobilizing
agents (vitamin d3 compounds, ionomycin, atp,
and thapsigargin) inhibit the activity of mamma-
lian target of rapamycin, a negative regulator of
macroautophagy, and induce massive accumu-
lation of autophagosomes in a beclin 1- and
atg7-dependent manner. this process is medi-
ated by ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase
kinase-b and amp-activated protein kinase
and inhibited by ectopic bcl-2 located in the en-
doplasmatic reticulum (er), where it lowers the
[ca2+]er and attenuates agonist-induced ca2+
ﬂuxes. thus, an increase in the [ca2+]c serves
as a potent inducer of macroautophagy and
as a target for the antiautophagy action of
er-located bcl-2.
introduction
cellular homeostasis is dependent on the balance
between the biosynthesis and degradation of its compo-
nents. macroautophagy (here referred to as autophagy)
is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal pathway involved
in the turnover of long-lived proteins, other cellular macro-
molecules, and whole organelles (codogno and meijer,
2005; kroemer and ja¨ a¨ ttela¨ , 2005; levine and klionsky,
2004). it begins when a ﬂat membrane cistern wraps
around cytoplasmic organelles and/or a portion of cytosol,
thus forming a closed double-membrane-surrounded
vacuole, the autophagosome that matures in a stepwise
process involving fusion events with endolysosomal vesi-
cles. the ﬁnal degradation step takes place within autoly-
sosomes, where lysosomal hydrolases digest the luminal
content of the autophagic vacuole to recyclable break-
down products.
autophagy proceeds in a low basal level in most if not all
cells, and it plays a crucial role in nutrient delivery, remod-
eling, differentiation, and removal of damaged molecules
and organelles. accordingly, its deregulation in mice leads
to either embryonic or perinatal lethality or neurodegener-
ation and cancer (hara et al., 2006; komatsu et al., 2006;
qu et al., 2003; yue et al., 2003). starvation, growth factor
deprivation, protein aggregation, numerous anticancer
treatments, and various other stresses increase autopha-
gic activity above the basal
levels. during starvation
stress, autophagy-mediated recycling of nutrients is
essential for the maintenance of cellular amino acid and
energy levels and thereby for cell survival (lum et al.,
2005; onodera and ohsumi, 2005). similarly, autophagy
serves a protective function during neuronal development
and in neurons challenged with aggregate-prone proteins
(hara et al., 2006; komatsu et al., 2006; ravikumar et al.,
2004). paradoxically, autophagy is also associated with
nonapoptotic type ii cell death, also called autophagic
degeneration (baehrecke, 2005; kroemer and ja¨ a¨ ttela¨ ,
2005; tsujimoto and shimizu, 2005). even though autoph-
agy genes act as mediators of the cell death in some
experimental conditions, increasing evidence suggests
that the accumulation of autophagosomes in dying cells
or tissues commonly represents a failed rescue effort in
response to external stress.
autophagosome formation is mediated by a set of evo-
lutionarily conserved autophagy-related proteins (atg pro-
teins) and inhibited by a serine threonine protein kinase
originally recognized as a target of rapamycin and thereby
named tor (codogno and meijer, 2005; klionsky et al.,
2003). tor functions as a sensor for cellular energy and
amino acid levels and is negatively regulated by the
amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) via a pathway

control of autophagy by ca2+, camkk-b, and bcl-2
involving the gtpase activating tuberous sclerosis com-
plex (tsc1/2) and its substrate ras-family gtp binding
protein rheb (sarbassov et al., 2005). ampk can be
phosphorylated and activated by lkb1 tumor suppressor
kinase at low energy levels and by ca2+/calmodulin-de-
pendent protein kinase kinase-b (camkk-b) in response
to an increase in the cytosolic-free calcium [ca2+]c (haw-
ley et al., 2005; shaw et al., 2004; woods et al., 2005).
even though the ampk-mediated inhibition of mammalian
tor (mtor) has been fairly well established, direct evi-
dence for its ability to induce autophagy is still lacking in
mammalian cells. snf1, the yeast ortholog of ampk, has,
however, been identiﬁed as a positive regulator of autoph-
agy (wang et al., 2001).
beclin 1, the mammalian ortholog of yeast atg6, repre-
sents an interesting link between autophagic and apopto-
tic machineries (levine and klionsky, 2004). beclin 1 is
a bcl-2 interacting protein that promotes autophagosome
formation when in complex with class iii phosphatidylino-
sitol-3-kinase (pi3k) and p150 myristylated kinase,
whereas the beclin 1-bcl-2 complex functions as a brake
of autophagy and autophagic cell death (pattingre et al.,
2005). intriguingly, the autophagy inhibition by bcl-2 is ev-
ident only when bcl-2 resides in the er, where it has been
suggested to regulate cellular ca2+ homeostasis (ferrari
et al., 2002; oakes et al., 2006). it should be noted that
bcl-2 and the proapoptotic bcl-2 proteins (bax and
bak) have also been reported to enhance and inhibit
the autophagic response, respectively (lum et al., 2005;
shimizu et al., 2004). thus, the impact of bcl-2-like pro-
teins on autophagy requires further exploration.
a rise in the [ca2+]c triggers disparate responses such
as changes in cell metabolism, muscle contraction, neuro-
transmitter release, cell proliferation, and cell death (fer-
rari et al., 2002). hitherto, practically nothing is known
about the role of ca2+ in autophagosome formation.
prompted by the ability of the ca2+-activated camkk-
b to activate the putative autophagy inducer ampk, and
the requirement of er location for the antiautophagy func-
tion of bcl-2, we investigated the role of ca2+ in autophagy
signaling in more detail. using state-of-the-art methods to
detect autophagy and subcellular ca2+ levels, we show
that ca2+ regulates autophagy via a signaling pathway in-
volving camkk-b, ampk, and mtor and that er-located
bcl-2 effectively inhibits this pathway. because both the
camkk-ampk signaling pathway and autophagy are
essential for eukaryotic cells from unicellular yeast to com-
plex tissues such as brain, these data are likely to have
broad implications for our understanding of autophagy-
mediated regulation of cellular homeostasis and cell
survival in general.
results
an increase in the [ca2+]c triggers autophagy
the active form of vitamin d3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3)
and its chemotherapeutic analog eb1089 induce a slow
increase in the [ca2+]c and autophagy followed by autoph-
agy-dependent cell death in mcf-7 breast cancer cells
(høyer-hansen et al., 2005; mathiasen et al., 2002). in
order to test whether the increase in the [ca2+]c actually
serves as a mediator of the autophagic response, we
studied the autophagosome formation in mcf-7 cells
expressing the autophagosome-associated lc3 protein
fused to the enhanced green ﬂuorescence protein
(egfp-lc3). as expected, a three-day treatment of the
cells with 100 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 or eb1089
signiﬁcantly increased the number of
the cells with
autophagosomes (lc3-positive vesicles; figure 1a). re-
markably, the addition of an intracellular ca2+ chelator
bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-n,n,n,n0-tetraacetic acid/
tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester (bapta/am) to the cells for
the last 2 hr of the treatment completely abolished the
autophagosomes. thus, ca2+ is required for the formation
of autophagosomes in response to vitamin d3 com-
pounds, whereas their turnover by the fusion with the lyso-
somal vesicles (i.e., the disappearance of the lc3-positive
vesicles) appears to be ca2+ independent.
prompted by the ability of bapta/am to inhibit 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin d3- and eb1089-induced autophago-
some formation, we next investigated whether an increase
in the [ca2+]c is enough to trigger autophagy. for this pur-
pose, we treated the egfp-lc3 expressing mcf-7 cells
with three stimuli that increase the [ca2+]c by different
means: (1) atp that acts on p2 purinoreceptors to gener-
ate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (ip3) that triggers the re-
lease of ca2+ from the er through ip3 receptor-regulated
channels, (2) ionomycin, a ca2+ ionophore that serves as
a mobile ca2+ carrier that equilibrates ca2+ levels across
biological membranes, including plasma and er mem-
branes, and (3) thapsigargin (tg), an inhibitor of er
ca2+-atpase (dixon et al., 1997; ferrari et al., 2002;
kao, 1994). all treatments induced a signiﬁcant increase
in the number of cells with lc3-positive vesicles, and in
all cases, the effect was effectively inhibited by bapta/
am (figure 1b). transmission electron microscopy (em)
ensured that the induction of lc3-postive vesicles by all
three ca2+ mobilizing agents correlated with the formation
of autophagosomes, cytosolic vesicles surrounded by
a double membrane (figure 1c and data not shown). im-
portantly, all the ca2+ mobilizing agents also enhanced
the degradation of long-lived proteins, indicating that the
morphological changes observed by confocal microscopy
(e) hela cells transiently transfected with egfp-lc3 were treated with 100 mm atp, 10 mm ionomycin, or 100 nm tg for 24 hr, and percentages of
green cross-sections with over ﬁve lc3-positive dots were counted. when indicated, the treatment was followed by 1 hr incubation with 10 mm
bapta/am. the values represent mean ± sd for three independent samples. similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.
*p value < 0.05, **p value < 0.01, and ***p value < 0.001 as compared to control samples without bapta/am (a, b, and e) or untreated

and transmission em reﬂected functional autophagy
(figure 1d). furthermore, ca2+ mobilizing agents induced
bapta/am-sensitive autophagosome formation in hela
cervix carcinoma cells (figure 1e). consistent with the
more potent autophagy inducing activity of tg as com-
pared with atp, 24 hr treatment of mcf-7 cells with
100 nm tg and 100 mm atp reduced the [ca2+]er by 87%
and 39%, respectively (data not shown). it should also
be noted that atp did not have any effect on cell growth
or survival during a 5 day follow-up period, whereas tg,
ionomycin, and vitamin d compounds induced cell death
1–2 days after
the appearance of autophagosomes
(høyer-hansen et al., 2005) (data not shown).
ca2+-induced autophagy is dependent on atg genes
and camkk-b
beclin 1, atg7, and class iii pi3k are required for the
starvation-induced autophagosome formation. in order
to test whether the ca2+-mediated autophagy proceeded
by the same signaling pathway, we depleted mcf-7 cells
for beclin 1 and atg7 by small interfering rnas (sirna)
(figures 2a and 2b) or treated them with 3-methyl-
adenine (3-ma), an inhibitor of class iii pi3k (figure 2c).
all treatments signiﬁcantly inhibited the appearance of
lc3-positive vesicles induced by eb1089, atp, ionomy-
cin, and tg (figures 2b and 2c). furthermore, autoph-
agy induced by ca2+ mobilizing agents was associated
with the inhibition mtor kinase activity as judged by
the reduced phosphorylation of its substrate, ribosomal
protein s6 kinase 1 (p70s6k)
in mcf-7 cells, and in
immortalized murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts (figures 2d
and 2e).
in order to gain insight into the ca2+-induced signaling
pathway mediating mtor inhibition and autophagy in-
duction, we next tested whether the recently reported
ca2+-camkk-b-ampk pathway was involved in this pro-
cess (hawley et al., 2005; woods et al., 2005). for this
purpose, we ﬁrst treated the cells with a camkk-a/b inhib-
itor (sto-609) (tokumitsu et al., 2002). as demonstrated
earlier in ionomycin-treated hela cells (woods et al.,
2005), ca2+ mobilizing agents activated ampk in an
sto-609-sensitive manner in mcf-7 cells (figure 3a).
remarkably, the sto-609-mediated inhibition of ca2+-
induced ampk activation was accompanied by a signiﬁ-
cant inhibition of autophagy in mcf-7 cells and in non-
transformed mcf-10a breast epithelial cells (figures
3b–3d). these data suggest that camkk and ampk, in-
deed, mediate ca2+-induced autophagy. accordingly,
the inhibition of ampk either by camkk-b-speciﬁc sirna
or by a pharmacological inhibitor (compound c) attenu-
ated autophagy induced by ca2+-mobilizing agents in
mcf-7 cells (figures 3e–3h). importantly, sto-609 and
camkk-b sirna also inhibited the activation of ampk
and the formation of autophagosomes in hela cervix
carcinoma cells treated with ca2+-mobilizing agents
(figure s1 in the supplemental data available with this
article online).
molecular cell
control of autophagy by ca2+, camkk-b, and bcl-2
er-localized bcl-2 inhibits
eb1089- and atp-induced autophagy
bcl-2 has been reported to regulate the cellular ca2+ han-
dling and to inhibit starvation-induced autophagy (ferrari
et al., 2002; pattingre et al., 2005). thus, we speculated
that bcl-2 could inhibit autophagy via its effects on ca2+
homeostasis. in order to test this hypothesis, we ex-
pressed wild-type bcl-2 (bcl-2) and its mutants in which
the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic sequence has been
either removed (bcl-cyt), resulting in cytosolic expression,
or exchanged to a corresponding membrane anchor from
an er-speciﬁc isoform of cytochrome b5 (bcl-er) or l.
monocytogenes acta (bcl-mito), resulting in a subcellular
localization restricted to the er and mitochondria, respec-
tively (zhu et al., 1996). western blot analysis and the abil-
ity to inhibit tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-induced dna
fragmentation and cell death conﬁrmed the equal expres-
sion levels and the functionality of the bcl-2 chimeras, and
the confocal microscopy veriﬁed their expected subcellu-
lar location in mcf-7 cells (figure 4). only cells expressing
bcl-er or wild-type bcl-2 showed colocalization with an
er marker protein, sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase
(serca). similarly, only bcl-mito and wild-type bcl-2
showed colocalization with the mitochondrial marker
protein cytochrome c.
next, we investigated the impact of bcl-2 chimeras on
ca2+-mediated autophagy by transmission em. as we
have shown earlier in the parental mcf-7 cells (høyer-
hansen et al., 2005), a 5 day treatment of the mock-
transfected cells with 100 nm eb1089 induced a massive
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles surrounded by
a double membrane (figures 5a and 5b). most of the vac-
uoles contained cristae-like structures resembling mito-
chondria, and the cross-sections of affected cells con-
tained practically no normal mitochondria. neither the
number of cellular cross-sections with eb1089-induced
autophagic vacuoles nor the appearance of the vacuoles
was affected by the ectopic expression of wild-type
bcl-2, bcl-cyt, or bcl-mito, whereas the cross-sections
of eb1089-treated bcl-er expressing cells were nearly
devoid of autophagic structures (figures 5a and 5b).
accordingly, only bcl-er was able to inhibit the eb1089-
induced autophagosome formation as assessed by the
translocation of egfp-lc3 into vesicular structures (fig-
ure s2). akin to eb1089 treatment, bcl-er, but not bcl-
mito, effectively inhibited autophagy in response to atp,
whose ca2+ mobilizing activity depends on er ca2+ stores
(figure 5c). on the contrary, the autophagosome forma-
tion induced by ionomycin that triggers ca2+ ﬂuxes from
both the er and the extracellular space was resistant to
bcl-2 whether localized to er or mitochondrial mem-
branes (figure 5c).
er-localized bcl-2 lowers the [ca2+]er and
reduces agonist-induced leak of ca2+ from the er
indirect evidence suggests that the eb1089-induced in-
crease in the [ca2+]c originates from the er (mathiasen
et al., 2002). in order to test whether eb1089 renders the

er membrane more permeable to ca2+, we measured
kinetic changes of [ca2+]c after the application of tert-
butylhydroquinone (tbhq), a reversible blocker of serca
pumps. the resting [ca2+]c in fura-2-loaded cells was sig-
niﬁcantly higher after 72 hr treatment with eb1089 (fig-
ure 6a), conﬁrming our previous observations (mathiasen
et al., 2002). furthermore, the [ca2+]c in the presence of
tbhq and external ca2+ (1 mm) reached a lower steady
state in eb1089-treated cells, proving again that the
[ca2+]er is reduced by the drug. also, the velocity of
[ca2+]c increase in the early phase after tbhq addition
was greatly enhanced, allowing us to conclude that the
eb1089 induced reduction in the [ca2+]er-reﬂected ca2+
leak from the er rather than reduced ca2+ extrusion
through the plasma membrane. moreover, we measured
the effect of eb1089 on [ca2+]er in mcf-7 cells trans-
fected with er-targeted aequorin (er-aeq), a ca2+ re-
porter protein with highly selective subcellular localization
(chiesa et al., 2001). eb1089 induced a time-dependent
decrease in [ca2+]er, reaching signiﬁcance at day three
when the [ca2+]er had fallen from 200 ± 8.3 mm to 159 ±
12.6 mm (figure 6b). these kinetics suggest that the
increase in the [ca2+]c that we have earlier shown to occur
three days after the start of the eb1089 treatment is a
result of eb1089-induced ca2+ release from the er
(mathiasen et al., 2002).
bcl-2 family proteins have been shown to regulate er
ca2+ homeostasis in other cell types (pinton and rizzuto,
2006). thus, we next investigated the effect of the bcl-2
chimeras on the eb1089-induced fall in the [ca2+]er. as
previously shown in different cell types, wild-type bcl-2
signiﬁcantly lowered steady-state [ca2+]er in mcf-7 cells
(figure 6c). this effect of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 family
proteins has been shown to be the consequence of
increased ca2+ leak from the er (pinton and rizzuto,
2006), which may follow bcl-2-dependent phosphoryla-
tion of the ip3 receptors in the er (oakes et al., 2005; white
et al., 2005). these data suggest that the effect is dependent
on er-localized bcl-2. indeed, cells expressing bcl-er
had a more robust decrease in steady state [ca2+]er as
compared to bcl-wt transfected cells, whereas bcl-mito

figure 5. er-targeted bcl-2 inhibits eb1089- and atp-induced autophagy
(a and b) mcf-7 cells transfected with the indicated bcl-2 constructs were treated with 100 nm eb for 5 days before ﬁxation for the transmission em. the
large images were taken with a 50003 objective (1 mm scale bars) and the close-up images with a 20,0003 objective. examples of autophagic vacuoles are
marked with arrows. percentages of cross-sections with autophagic vesicles were obtained by counting 30 randomly chosen cross-sections. the values
represent mean ± sd for combined data from two independent experiments (bcl-cyt was tested only once) with two independent single-cell clones.
(c) mcf-7 cells transfected with the indicated bcl-2 constructs were treated with 100 mm atp for 48 hr or 1 mm ionomycin for 24 hr and analyzed by
transmission em as in (a). the values represent mean ± sd for data combined from two independent blocks.
however, be noted that the decrease in the [ca2+]er in-
duced by another serca pump inhibitor (tbhq) was effec-
tively inhibited by bcl-er (data not shown). thus, we con-
clude that bcl-er, either through a direct effect on the er
membrane or indirectly by reducing the steady state
[ca2+]er (the driving force for ca2+ leak), is able to speciﬁ-
cally inhibit agonist-induced ca2+ release into the cyto-
plasm, which might explain its capacity to inhibit ca2+-me-
diated autophagosome formation.
discussion
ca2+ mobilizing agents trigger autophagy
our data demonstrate that the ca2+ mobilizing agents
are potent inducers of autophagy. a massive increase
in the number of autophagosomes was evident following
unrelated ca2+ mobilizing stimuli such as (1) vitamin d
compounds that induce a slow release of ca2+ from
the er, (2) atp that generates ip3 and activates ip3

figure 6. bcl-er inhibits eb1089-in-
duced calcium fluxes
(a) for [ca2+]c measurements, fura-2-loaded
mcf-7 cells were imaged as described in the
experimental procedures. control cells and
cells treated with 100 nm eb1089 for 72 hr
were stimulated with 100 mm tbhq, as indi-
cated. traces were calibrated according to
standard protocols (szabadkai et al., 1999),
and the mean ± sem of >40 cells from three in-
dependent experiments is shown. resting
[ca2+]c before tbhq addition was 66.4 ±
2.6 nm in nontreated cells versus 92.6 ±
2.7 nm after eb1089 treatment. steady-state
plateau after
tbhq addition was 408.4 ±
19.8 nm in controls versus 385.0 ± 8.6 in
eb1089-treated cells.
(b) steady-state [ca2+]er was measured in
mcf-7 cells transiently transfected with er-
aeq and left untreated or treated with 100 nm
eb1089 for the indicated periods. mean ± sem
from nine experiments are shown. *p < 0.05.
(c) [ca2+]er was measured in cells cotrans-
fected with the er-aeq probe and the indi-
cated bcl-2 constructs and is presented as
mean ± sem from eight experiments as in (b).
*p < 0.05.
(d) the effect of differentially targeted bcl-2
constructs on eb1089 induced ca2+ depletion.
[ca2+]er was measured in cells transfected as in
(c) and left untreated or treated with 100 nm
eb1089 for 72 hr. the effect of eb1089 was cal-
culated from paired data from the two groups
(nontreated minus eb1089 treated). mean ±
sem of the differences (d[ca2+]er) is shown
from a minimum of nine experiments. *p < 0.05.
(e) effect of bcl-2-er on steady-state [ca2+]er and atp-induced ca2+ release. mcf-7 cells were transiently transfected with the eraeq probe alone
(control) or with bcl-2-er. after reconstitution of eraeq with coelenterazine (see experimental procedures), cells were perfused with ca2+-free krb
solution containing 100 mm egta. krb containing 1 mm cacl2 was added as indicated to induce er ca2+ uptake. after reaching the steady-state
[ca2+]er levels, cells were stimulated with 100 mm atp (arrows in the left panel). the left panel shows representative traces of [ca2+]er measurements
from control and bcl-2-er-transfected cells, and the right panel shows mean ± sem of [ca2+]er changes after atp addition from greater than seven
traces from two independent experiments.
(f) effect of bcl-2-er on atp-induced ca2+ release. mcf-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cytaeq probe alone (control) or with er bcl-2-
er. cells were perfused with krb containing 1 mm cacl2 and stimulated with 100 mm atp as indicated. the left panel shows representative traces of
[ca2+]c measurements. the right panel shows mean ± sem of [ca2+]c peaks after atp addition from greater than seven traces from two separate
experiments.
receptor-regulated ca2+ channels in the er, (3) tg that
inhibits er ca2+-atpase, and (4) ionomycin that allows
ca2+ ﬂuxes from both the extracelluar space and the er
(ferrari et al., 2002; kao, 1994; mathiasen et al., 2002).
importantly, the accumulation of autophagosomes in-
duced by all ca2+ mobilizing agents was accompanied
by a signiﬁcant increase in the degradation rate of long-
lived proteins that reﬂects functional autophagy. thus,
the increase in the number of autophagosomes in cells
treated with ca2+ mobilizing agents is due to the in-
creased formation of autophagosomes rather than their
defective turnover.
even though the existing autophagy literature frequently
lists ca2+ as a putative second messenger, the experi-
mental challenging of this hypothesis has been very lim-
ited. consistent with our data, seglen and coworkers
have shown that calcium chelators (bapta/am, egta,
and edta) suppress constitutive autophagy in hepato-
cytes as analyzed by the sequestration of lactate dehydro-
genase (ldh) into cytosolic vesicles (gordon et al., 1993).
based on the inhibitory effect of ca2+ mobilizing agents in
their model system, they concluded, however, that ldh
autophagy depends on intracellular ca2+ stores rather
than the increase in the [ca2+]c. this controversy may be
due to the differences in experimental set ups. first, the
ldh autophagy in hepatocytes was analyzed 3 hr after
the stimuli, whereas the increase in atp-, ionomycin,
tg-, and eb1089-induced autophagosome formation
was ﬁrst evident after a lag time of 24–72 hr. second,
the inhibitory effect of tg on ldh sequestration was de-
tected only at micromolar concentrations, whereas the
formation of autophagosomes in our model system was
molecular cell 25, 193–205, january 26, 2007 ª2007 elsevier inc. 201
evident at 100 nm. we have earlier shown that tg is an ef-
fective inducer of lysosomal membrane permeabilization
(høyer-hansen et al., 2005), an event that could explain
the autophagy inhibitory effect of high concentrations of
tg. third, the ldh sequestration assay may measure mi-
croautophagy in addition to macroautophagy analyzed in
this study. finally, bapta/am, which is hydrolyzed to
a membrane-impermeable form by cytosolic esterases
and thereby arrested in the cytosol, inhibited autophagy
in both model systems. thus, the increased [ca2+]c rather
than ca2+ in other cellular compartments appears respon-
sible for the autophagy induction. this conclusion is
further supported by the identiﬁcation of a cytosolic
ca2+-activated kinase, camkk-b, as an essential media-
tor of ca2+-induced autophagy, as well as by the ﬁnding
that inhibition of autophagy by targeted bcl-2 constructs
was related to their effect on agonist-induced ca2+
release from the er and not on the steady-state [ca2+]er.
ca2+ induces autophagy via a signaling pathway
involving camkk-b and mtor
our data show that ca2+ mobilizing agents induce auto-
phagy via a signaling pathway involving camkk-b,
a ca2+-activated kinase that was recently identiﬁed as
a direct activator of ampk (hawley et al., 2005; woods
et al., 2005). these data suggest that akin to the other
known ampk kinase, lkb1, that triggers the repression
of mtor under low atp conditions in an ampk- and
tsc2-dependent manner (shaw et al., 2004), camkk-b
may activate a similar pathway in response to an
increase in the [ca2+]c (figure 7). the existence of such a
pathway is strongly supported by our data showing that
camkk-b and ampk are required for the ca2+-induced
the ca2+-
autophagosome formation. furthermore,
induced camkk-b-dependent activation of ampk to-
gether with the mounting evidence implicating ampk in
the negative regulation of mtor points to ampk-tsc2-
rheb pathway as a possible link between camkk-
b and autophagy (sarbassov et al., 2005). it remains to
be studied whether camkk-b-mediated suppression of
mtor is sufﬁcient to trigger autophagy or whether ca2+
mobilizing agents trigger parallel signaling pathways
required for the process.
er-localized bcl-2 affects ca2+ handling in the er
and inhibits ca2+-mediated autophagy
concordant with our data showing that bcl-2 has to locate
to the er membrane in order to inhibit eb1089- and atp-
induced autophagy, levine and coworkers have recently
shown that er-localized, but not mitochondrial, bcl-2 in-
hibits starvation-induced autophagy (pattingre et al.,
2005). based on data suggesting that the autophagy in-
hibitory effect of bcl-2 depends on the direct binding of
bcl-2 with beclin 1, they speculated that the er-localized
bcl-2-beclin 1 complex blocks a signal that is essential for
the formation of the autophagy promoting beclin 1-class
iii pi3k complex. we could, however, not detect any be-
clin-1 associated with the er in untreated mcf-7 cells

figure 7. schematic presentation of the suggested signaling
cascade from the increase in the [ca2+]c to autophagy

leading from the increase in the free intracellular ca2+ to increased au-

or in cells treated with eb1089 or ionomycin. instead, we
found beclin 1 in granular dots throughout the cytosol in
control cells as well as in cells expressing ectopic bcl-
er or beclin 1 (figure s3). furthermore, expression of ec-
topic beclin 1 in mcf- 7 cells did not have any effect on
steady-state [ca2+]er or atp-induced increase in [ca2+]c
(data not shown). thus, our data suggest that er-located
bcl-2 inhibits autophagy induced by ca2+ mobilizing
agents by regulating the ca2+ homeostasis in a beclin 1-
independent manner.
if the antiautophagy function of
bcl-2 was solely mediated by its effect on the steady-state
[ca2+]er, wild-type bcl-2 should confer at least partial pro-
tection against eb1089- and atp-induced autophagy in
mcf-7 cells. this was, however, not the case. instead,
the ability of the bcl-2 mutants to inhibit autophagy corre-
lated with their ability to reduce the amount of agonist-in-
duced ca2+ release from the er. these results, together
with the inhibitory effect of bapta/am and the cytosolic
induction of camkk-b, strongly argue for the involvement
of [ca2+]c changes in the autophagy induction.
the effect of bcl-2 on the [ca2+]er is controversial, and
the literature contains conﬂicting data showing both in-
creased and decreased [ca2+]er in bcl-2 expressing cells,

control of autophagy by ca2+, camkk-b, and bcl-2
depending on the cell type and the methods used (annis
et al., 2004; ferrari et al., 2002; oakes et al., 2006). the
studies in which [ca2+]er has been measured directly by
er-targeted ca2+-sensitive photoproteins support the
view that bcl-2 mainly acts on [ca2+]er by increasing the
ca2+ permeability of the er membrane (foyouzi-yousseﬁ
et al., 2000; pinton et al., 2000; vanden abeele et al.,
2002). consistent with this view that is compatible with
bcl-2 functioning as an ion channel or a modulator of an
ion channel, bcl-2 reduced the steady-state [ca2+]er in
the mcf-7 cells. this effect was even more prominent in
cells expressing er-located bcl-2 and absent if bcl-2
was targeted to mitochondrial membranes or cytosol,
suggesting that bcl-2 has to physically interact with the
er in order to reduce the [ca2+]er. indeed, recent work
put forward a potential mechanism to explain the effect
of bcl-2 family members on [ca2+]er, including their direct
interaction with and phosphorylation of the er resident
ca2+ release channel ip3r (pinton and rizzuto, 2006).
along these lines, we cannot exclude that direct interac-
tion of bcl-er with er membrane protein complexes
may provide a mechanism to regulate autophagosome
formation, which may function parallel to [ca2+]c regula-
tion of camkk-b, described in this work.
surprisingly, bcl-mito enhanced the eb1089-induced
depletion of [ca2+]er. even though we do not have direct
data to explain this phenomenon, two observations may
provide some clue. first, er stress, which is induced by
lowering the [ca2+]er, augments the colocalization of the
er and mitochondrial networks, rendering bcl-mito in
physical contact with the er (m. chami, b. oules, g.s.,
and p. paterlini-brechot, unpublished data). second, the
em images show that eb1089-treated bcl-mito cells
have signiﬁcantly more dark electron-dense precipitates
in their autophagosome-surrounded mitochondria (fig-
ure 5a). similar precipitates appear after vast ca2+ load
into mitochondria (pasquali-ronchetti et al., 1969), sug-
gesting that ca2+ released by eb1089 in bcl-mito
expressing cells is preferentially transported to the mito-
this ca2+ load may
chondrial matrix. consequently,
induce mitochondrial stress and thereby enhance autoph-
agy. in conclusion, by localizing to er and mitochondria,
respectively, bcl-2 might inhibit the autophagy response
by lowering the amount of free er ca2+ available for
release and increase it via the enhanced mitochondrial
uptake of ca2+. such a combined anti- and proautophagy
function of bcl-2 may help to maintain autophagy at a level
that is compatible with cell survival, rather than death.
experimental procedures
cell culture and treatments
the mcf-7s1 breast carcinoma and hela cell cervix carcinoma cells
were cultured in rpmi 1640 with glutamax (life technologies) supple-
mented with 6% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (fcs, biological
industries) and antibiotics. nih3t3 murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts
were grown in d-mem (life technologies) with 10% heat-inactivated
fcs and 0.1 mmol/l nonessential amino acids (invitrogen). mcf10a
breast epithelial cells expressing an ecotropic receptor were kindly

boston, ma, usa) and grown in dmem-f12 (life technologies) with
10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 mg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epider-
mal growth factor, 100 ng/ml choleratoxin, 500 ng/ml hydrochorti-
sone, and antibiotics.
eb1089 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 were kindly provided by lise
binderup (leo pharmaceuticals) and human tnf by anthony cerami
(kenneth warren laboratories, tarrytown, ny, usa). ionomycin, tg,
and 3-ma were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo),
bapta/am and compound c from calbiochem, and sto-609 from
tocris bioscience.
transfections
plasmids containing cdnas for wild-type bcl-2 and its organelle-
speciﬁc mutants were kindly provided by b. leber and d.w. andrews
(mcmaster university, hamilton, ontario, canada) and subcloned into
the episomal vector pcep4 (invitrogen). rat lc3 inserted into pegfp-
c1 (clontech) and pbabe-puro vectors was a generous gift from
g. kroemer. the plasmid encoding er-aeq was described previously
(pinton et al., 2000). cells were transfected by electroporation essen-
tially as described before (ja¨ a¨ ttela¨ et al., 1995) with fugene hd
(roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. mcf10a-ecor
cells were infected with indicated retrovira as previously described
(fehrenbacher et al., 2004).
sirnas corresponding to the human cdna sequence for beclin-1
(50-cagtttggcacaatcaata-30) and a control sirna (50-cgacc
gagacaagcgcaag-30) were from dharmacon research, for atg7
(50-caguggaucuaaaucucaaacugau-30)
from invitrogen, and
for camkk-a (50-ggaagcuuucccuacaggatt-30) and camkk-b
(50-ggaucugaucaaaggcauctt-30) from ambion. mcf-7 and hela
cells were transfected with 50 and 25 nm sirna, respectively, employ-
ing oligofectamine (invitrogen).
autophagy and apoptosis detection
percentages of cells with egfp-lc3 translocation into dots (a mini-
mum of 100 cells/sample) were counted in egfp-lc3 expressing cells
ﬁxed in 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.19% picric acid (vol/vol) applying
zeiss axiovert 100 m confocal laser scanning microscope.
protein degradation and transmission em were evaluated as
described previously (høyer-hansen et al., 2005). for quantifying
autophagic cells in em images, a minimum of 30 cells was counted
in each sample.
cell death was analyzed by determining dna fragmentation
(cytosolic histone-bound dna) employing the cell death detection
elisaplus kit (roche) or by ﬂow cytometry (becton dickinson, san
jose, ca) of cells stained with sytox green (s-7020, molecular
probes) as described previously (høyer-hansen et al., 2005).
immunodetection
the primary antibodies used for immunoblot analysis included murine
antibodies against bcl-2 (clone 124, boehringer mannheim), beclin 1
(clone 20, bd transduction laboratories), gapdh (biogenesis), and
p-p70s6k (thr389) (#9206, cell signaling technology, inc, danvers,
ma); rabbit antibodies against p70s6k (#9202), ampk (#2630), and
p-ampk (#2535) from cell signaling technology; atg7 from prosci
incorporated (poway, ca, usa; #3617); and p-acc (#07-303) from
upstate and hsc70 from stressgen. the appropriate peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies were from dako a/s and ecl
immunoblotting reagents from amersham biosciences. the imagej
and image gauge (fuji) densitometry software was used to quantify
the proteins level.
for immunocytochemistry, the cells were ﬁxed with 3.7% formalde-
hyde and permeabilized in 0.2% triton x-100. after blocking in 5%
donkey or goat serum, the slides were incubated with murine anti-
bodies against cytochrome c (clone 6h2.b4 form pharmigen), serca
(calbiochem), and beclin 1 (clone 20, bd transduction laboratories)
as well as rabbit anti-bcl-2 (stressgen). the appropriate ﬂuorescent
molecular cell 25, 193–205, january 26, 2007 ª2007 elsevier inc. 203
secondary antibodies were from molecular probes. pictures were
taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (zeiss axiovert
100m equipped with lsm510 system).
rt-pcr
the quantitative rt-pcr using porphobilinogen deaminase (pbdg)
as an internal control was preformed essentially as described (rohde
et al., 2005). the following primers were applied: camkk-a, 50-
gacatcaagccatccaacct-30 and 50-gggcacttcccatagaca
aa-30; camkk-b, 50-agaccaggcccgtttctact-30 and 50-gaa
gatcttgcgggtctcag-30.
dynamic in vivo [ca2+] measurements with targeted aequorin
probes and fura-2
for [ca2+]er measurements, er-aeq-transfected cells were reconsti-
tuted with coelenterazine after er ca2+ depletion in a solution contain-
ing [ca2+], 600 mm egta, and 1 mm ionomycin, as described (szabad-
kai et al., 2004). cells were transferred to the perfusion chamber, and
light signal was collected in a purpose-built luminometer and cali-
brated into [ca2+] values (chiesa et al., 2001). all aequorin measure-
ments were carried out in krb containing 1 mm cacl2 (krb/ca2+,
krebs-ringer modiﬁed buffer: 135 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm
mgso4, 0.4 mm k2hpo4, 1 mm cacl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm
hepes [ph 7.4]). kinetic imaging of [ca2+]c transients in fura-2-loaded
cells was performed as previously described (szabadkai et al., 2004).
statistical analysis
independent experiments were pooled when the coefﬁcient of
variance could be assumed identical. statistical signiﬁcance was
evaluated by using one or two sample t tests. a p value of less than
0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
