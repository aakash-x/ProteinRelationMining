abstract apoptosis  as  well  as  autophagy  have  been
implicated  in  the  death  of  cerebellar  purkinje  cells
(pcs) in the lurcher (lc/+) mutant mouse and at least
two  diverent  apoptotic  pathways  participate  in  the
transsynaptic death of granule cells (gc) and inferior
olivary  (io)  neurones.  the  relative  contribution  of
these  pathways  can  only  be  assessed  from  their
momentary  involvement at  any stage of the complete
course of  neurodegeneration. here  we used  quantita-
tive labelling for activated caspase-3 (casp-3) and flu-
oro-jade  b  (fj-b)  to  investigate  the  spatio-temporal
pattern  of  neuronal  death  from  p6  to  p67  in  lc/+
mutants. activated casp-3 was present only in narrow
time intervals (p14 to p22 in pcs; p14 to p28 in gcs)
and in small subpopulations of pcs, gcs, and io neu-
rones.  fj-b  positive  pcs  were  detected  during  a
broader period (p14 to p28), and outnumbered casp-3
labelled pcs by a factor exceeding eight. nevertheless,
fj-b labelling was restricted to pcs and never found in
either  gc  or  io  neurones.  in  conclusion,  we  present
the  wrst  complete  time  course  and  extent  of  casp-3
activation in lc/+ mutants and show that the majority
of  dying  neurones  in  lc/+  mutants  undergo  casp-3
independent  cell  death.  the  cellular  overload  pro-
duced by the initial gene defect in lc/+ mutants appar-
ently activates a variety of apoptotic and non-apoptotic
pathways within the same neuronal population. more-
over,  we  present  the  wrst  evidence  for  the  ability  of

introduction
in  the  lurcher  (lc/+)  mutant  mouse  [39],  a  point
mutation in the ♥2 glutamate receptor (glur♥2) gene
[58]  leads  to  the  degeneration  of  almost  all  purkinje
cells (pcs), about 95% of which die between postnatal
day (p) 8 and p25 [6, 18, 48, 52, 53]. the lc/+ mutation
causes large constitutive inward currents in cerebellar
pcs  leading  to  their  chronic  depolarisation  [58]  and

death  [6].  apparently,  the  excitotoxic  processes  that
characterise this type of mutation make lc/+ mice suit-
able  to  serve  as  an  animal  model  for  investigating
excitotoxicity in a variety of human neurodegenerative
conditions [8, 21, 23, 51].
recent evidence suggests that more than one singu-
lar  mechanism  accounts  for  the  death  of  pcs  in  lc/+
mutants  because:  (a)  deletion  of  bax  expression
altered  the  pattern  of  caspase-3  activation  and  also
delayed but not prevented cell death of lc/+ pcs [11,
45]. this implies  not  only  that lc/+ pcs can  die by  a
bax-independent pathway but also that bax is involved
in activating caspase-3 during the normal course of pc
death in lc/+ mutants [11, 45, 51]. (b) the overexpres-
sion of bcl-2, that can also delay the death of lc/+ pcs,
provides  a  further  argument  for  apoptosis  being
involved in lc/+ pc death [56, 57]. (c) a delay in the
death of lc/+ pcs was also observed after elimination
of  the  serine  protease  tissue  plasminogen  activator
(tpa) [37], suggesting that a receptor-mediated apop-
totic  pathway  normally  may  also  contribute  to  the
death  of  lc/+  pcs.  (d)  on  the  other  hand,  glur♥2lc
can induce autophagy in pcs via a signalling pathway
mediated by this mutated receptor and a novel isoform
of  a  pdz  domain-containing  protein  (n-pist)  and
beclin1 [55]. as dying lc/+ pcs also contain autopha-
gic  vacuoles  in  vivo  [55],  the  autophagic  mechanisms
probably contribute to the death of lc/+ pcs.
the  primary  loss  of  pcs  in  the  lc/+  cerebellum  is
followed  by  a  secondary,  target-related  transsynaptic
degeneration of cerebellar granule cells (gc) and infe-
rior  olivary  (io)  neurones.  apoptosis-related  death
avects  about  56%  of  gcs  between  p8  and  p12,
whereby almost 90% of all gcs are lost at p60 [6, 37].
target-related death of io neurones, already apparent
at p11, comprises about 70% of the complete neuronal
population in adult lc/+ mutants [6, 9, 20]. in contrast
to observations made in case of pcs, the elimination of
bax expression rescued lc/+ gcs but not io neurones.
bcl-2  overexpression,  on  the  other  hand,  rescued  io
neurones without avecting the survival of gcs [11, 45].
this  implies  that  gcs  and  io  neurones  perish  via
diverent apoptotic pathways [51].
despite  these  diverences,  casp-3  activation  has
been observed in all these three cell types [29, 44, 49].
however, the relative contribution of casp-3 mediated
apoptosis to the general cell death can only be assessed
from the full time course of degeneration in the  lc/+
mutant  and  the  regional  analysis  of  neuronal  types
avected.  it  was  our  intention  to  examine  the  parallel
time  courses  of  casp-3  activation  and  fluoro-jade  b
(fj-b)  labelling  in  lc/+  mutants  during  the  complete
period of degeneration proceeding in pcs, gcs and io
123
neurones. fj-b was selected for its ability to label only
dying  neurones,  and  the  presumed  low  selectivity  for
any particular mode of death process [42]. fj-b appar-
ently labelled neurones dying from various causes such
as  neurotoxicity  [13,  16,  22,  41],  excitotoxicity  [5,  14,
19], and ischaemia [26, 30, 38].
to  allow  parallel  comparison  of  cell  loss  with  the
pattern of casp-3 and fj-b staining, the progression of
cell  loss  was  also  monitored  with  nissl-staining  and
with antibodies against calbindin d-28 k (calb), which
is a reliable marker for the identiwcation of cerebellar
pcs and io neurones [3, 4, 31]. finally, our main objec-
tive was to examine whether cell death in lc/+ mutants
may follow various routes and whether the chronologi-
cal correlation of staining patterns produced by the cell
death  markers  used  in  the  study  may  allow  a  better
insight into the diversity of death pathways.
materials and methods
animals
experimental  animals  were  wild  type  (+/+)  mice
(b6cba)  and  the  ovspring  of  lc/+  breeder  pairs
(b6cbacaaw-j/a-grid2lc) purchased from the jack-
son  laboratories  (bar  harbor,  usa).  mice,  kept
under a daily light period of 12 h, consumed food and
water ad lib. the lc/+ mutants, aged from p14 to p67,
were phenotypically recognised by their ataxia and his-
tologically  conwrmed  by  their  atrophic  cerebellum.
younger animals (<p14), where the above procedure is
insuycient to unequivocally determine the presence of
the  lc-allele,  were  genotyped  according  to  a  method
described  previously  [37]  (for  details  see  below).  in
total, 62 murine brains (30 +/+ and 32 lc/+) were dis-
sected  on  postnatal  days  p6,  p8,  p14,  p16,  p19,  p22,
p28, p32, p52 and p67. all experiments were approved
by  the  local  “animal  care  and  use  committee”  and
conform to nih guidelines.
genotyping
genomic  dna  of  the  lc/+  ovspring  was  extracted
(dneasy  tissue  kit,  qiagen,  hilden,  germany)  from
tails at p2, according to the method of lu and tsirka
[37]. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the lc-allele
of  the  glutamate  receptor  ionotrophic  delta  2  gene
(grid2)  was  performed  by  an  acii-mediated  diges-
tion,  using  a  forward  primer  [5⬘-primer  (5⬘-cggg
tgatagtgaggaaag-3⬘, mwg-biotech)] and a
reverse  primer  (5⬘-cgggtgatagtgaggaaa
g-3⬘, mwg-biotech). pcr was conducted with 200 ng
acta neuropathol (2006) 112:691–702
693
of  genomic  dna  (taq  pcr  core  kit,  qiagen)  in  a
total  volume  of  50 ♯l.  reactions  included  an  initial
denaturation  at  94°c  for  3 min  and  subsequent  30
cycles  of  denaturation  at  94°c  for  30 s,  annealing  at
55°c for 45 s, and extension at 72°c for 60 s. the pcr
product  was  puriwed  with  a  minielute  pcr  puriwca-
tion  kit  (qiagen)  and  digested  with  acii  restriction
enzyme  (neb,  uk).  samples  of  the  digested  pcr
product were subjected to electrophoresis (3% gena-
garose tiny, genaxxon, stazangen, germany). bands
were visualised with ethidium bromide and compared
with a dna-marker (puc 19/mspi, roth, karlsruhe,
germany).  the  wild  type  and  the  lc-allele  yielded
respective 90 and 108 bp bands (fig. 1).
tissue preparation and histology
after  a  lethal  dose (1.75 g/kg body weight)  of chloral
hydrate, all mice were transcardially perfused. initially,
the  perfusion  proceeded  with  a  warm  saline  at  37°c
and  subsequently with 4% paraformaldehyde in po4-
buver  (0.1  m,  ph  7.4)  at  4°c  for  a  total  of  30 min.
fixed brains were immediately dissected, embedded in
agar and cut parasagitally in ice-cold po4-buver with a
vibratome  (series  1000;  tpi  inc.,  st.  louis,  usa)  at
50 ♯m  intervals.  consecutive  sections  were  either
mounted on gelatine-coated slides and dried on a slide
warmer  for  10–30 min  at  about  50°c  (for  fj-b  and
nissl-stain)  or  further  processed  for  free-xoating
immunohistochemistry  as  follows:  section  1 = nissl-
stain,  section  2 = fj-b 
labelling,  section  3 = anti-
cleaved  casp-3,  section  4 = anti-calb.  staining  for
nissl-substance  conformed  to  a  standard  thionin-
staining protocol.

staining  proceeded  according  to  the  protocol  of
schmued and hopkins [42]. solution of fj-b (histo-
chem  inc.  jeverson,  ar,  usa)  was  always  freshly
prepared from 0.01% stock solution, normally stored
at 4°c in the dark for up to 2 months. the  wnal dye
concentration  was  0.0004%  in  0.1%  acetic  acid.
slides  with  mounted  sections  were  immersed  in  1%
naoh in 80% etoh for 5 min, followed by 2 min in
70%  etoh  and  2 min  in  dh2o.  slides  were  then
transferred  to  freshly  prepared  0.06%  kmno4  in
dh2o.  they  remained  in  the  solution,  under  gentle
shaking, for 10 min. then the slides were washed for
2 min  in  dh2o,  subsequently  stained  in  the  fj-b
staining  solution  for 20 min  in  the  dark on a  shaker
and  wnally  washed  three  times  in  dh2o  for  1 min.
after the removal of excess water, the sections were
dried  for  10 min  in  the  dark  on  a  slide  warmer  at
about 50°c. dry slides were immersed in xylene for
at least 1 min and cover slipped with dpx mounting
medium (ems, washington, usa). all sections were
examined  with  a  zeiss  epixuorescent  microscope
equipped  with  a  xuorescein  isothiocyanate  (fitc)
wlter.
immunohistochemistry
alternate  brain  sections  of  mutant  and  wild  type
mice, matched for age, were simultaneously immuno-
incubated  with  either  mouse  monoclonal  antibodies
against calb (clone 300, swiss antibodies, bellinzona,
switzerland)  or  with  rabbit  monoclonal  antibodies
against cleaved casp-3 (asp 175 5a1, cell signalling
technology, beverly, ma, usa). anti-calb is one of
the  most  frequently  used  markers  for  the  selective
and golgi-like labelling of cerebellar pcs [7, 17, 27].
anti-cleaved casp-3 is directed against amino-termi-
nal  residues  adjacent  to  (asp175)  in  human  casp-3.
the speciwcity of this antibody for the activated form
of  casp-3  has  been  widely  documented  in  western
blot,  immunocytochemical  and  immunohistochemi-
cal approaches [25, 33]. preabsorption of anti-cleaved
casp-3 with blocking peptide (#1050, cell signalling
technology,  usa)  for  2 h  prior  to  immunoincuba-
tion  as  well  as  excluding  the  primary  antiserum
completely  prevented  all  immunostaining  in  both
conditions.  prior  to  immunoincubation  endogenous
peroxidase  was  blocked  with  2%  h2o2  and  10%
methanol in phosphate-buvered saline (pbs; 0.01 m,
ph 7.5) for 20 min. after washing twice for 5 min in
dh2o and for 5 min in tris-buvered saline (tbs; 0.05
m,  ph  7.6),  non-speciwc  binding  was  minimised  by
123

preincubation  in  a  solution  containing  10%  rabbit
(for  calb)  or  goat  (for  casp-3)  serum,  1%  bovine
serum  albumin  (bsa)  and  0.5%  triton-x-100  in
tbs.  the  calb-antibody  was  used  at  a  dilution  of
1:10,000 and anti-casp-3 at 1:100. brain sections were
incubated  overnight  under  gentle  shaking  with  the
primary antisera at 4°c in a humid chamber. immu-
nohistochemistry  followed  a  standard  protocol  for
the  peroxidase-antiperoxidase  (pap)-method  [47].
unconjugated  rabbit  anti-mouse  (for  calb)  or  goat
anti-rabbit (for casp-3) secondary antibodies (dako,
denmark),  diluted  at  1:100  were  incubated  under
gentle shaking  for 2 h at room temperature. after  a
3 £ 5 min  wash  in  tbs,  the  sections  were  incubated
at  room  temperature  for  1 h  in  pap-mouse  (calb,
dako)  or  pap-rabbit  (casp-3,  dako)  solutions,
diluted  1:50.  after  three  additional  washing  steps  in
tbs, the binding sites were visualised by reacting the
peroxidase  with  0.05%  diaminobenzidine  (sigma,
germany) in tbs containing 0.03% h2o2 for 5 min.
finally,  the  sections  were  washed  again  in  tbs  and
dh2o, then mounted on gelatine-coated glass-slides,
dried on a hot plate, dehydrated in a graded series of
etoh and xylene and cover slipped.
quantiwcation
we  performed  cell  counts  in  50 ♯m  thick  parasagittal
sections in each of at least three mice at each pertinent
postnatal age to gain some quantitative estimate on the
relative  incidence  of  casp-3-  and  fj-b-labelled  pcs
and gcs in lc/+ mutants. to minimize the inxuence of
latero-medial diverences in the cross-sectional area of
the  cerebellar  cortex  between  diverent  sections,  sec-
tions  were  sampled  systematically  from  all  brains.
beginning  with  the  lateral  most  section  that  included
cerebellar  cortex,  we  counted  labelled  cells  in  every
fourth  section  up  to  the  midsagittal  level.  this  sam-
pling strategy provided a mean of 18 sampled sections
from an average of about 75 sections per hemicerebel-
lum.  to  avoid  a  possible  bias  from  potential  regional
diverences in the density of labelled neurons, counting
was performed over the complete cross-sectional area
of  all  sampled  sections.  only  those  stained  neurons
with  a  clearly  discernible  cell  body  were  counted.
finally, cell counts from all sampled sections of a given
brain were summarized and divided by the number of
sampled sections to obtain the number of positive cells
per section.
the  signiwcance  of  the  diverence  in  cell  counts  for
lc/+ mutants at diverent ages was calculated with the
wilcoxon  test  for  independent  samples  (mann–whit-
ney u test).

results
progression of cell death in the cerebellar cortex
of lc/+ mutants
the  time  course  of  neuronal  degeneration  in  lc/+
mutants, together with the extent of cell loss in the var-
ious  neuronal populations  has  been extensively  docu-
mented [6, 9, 12, 18, 20, 37, 48, 52, 53]. hence, we did
not  attempt  to  replicate  these  studies,  as  quantifying
the  absolute  cell  loss  at  each  postnatal  age  selected
would  have  been  beyond  the  scope  of  this  investiga-
tion.  in  this  study,  we  quantitatively  evaluated  the
extent and time course of neuronal death with casp-3
immunohistochemistry and fj-b labelling. in parallel,
we used also nissl-staining (fig. 2a, e, f, g) to qualita-
tively  assess  the reduction  of the  granule cell  popula-
tion and calb-immunohistochemistry (fig. 2b, c, h–m)
to monitor pc loss. in wild types, the normal postnatal
development of the cerebellum was virtually complete
by  the  end  of  the  second  postnatal  week  (fig. 2a,  b).
the wrst signs of degeneration in lc/+ mutants, such as
axonal swellings and torpedoes in pc-wbres, appeared
at  around  p8  (not  shown  here  at  this  age,  but  see
fig. 2 k–m,  [12]).  even  at  p14,  the  cell  loss  in  lc/+
mutants is barely visible, because the gc layer appears
normal  and  the  pc  layer  has  only  few  interruptions
(compare  fig. 2a,  b  with  e,  h).  however,  even  at  p14
there  must  be  some  cell  loss,  because  the  cross  sec-
tional area of the lc/+ cerebellum is only about 45% of
the area seen in the age matched wild type. a higher
magniwcation revealed that almost all pc-axons of lc/
+ mutants show axonal swellings [12]. these swellings,
never seen in age-matched wild types (compare fig. 2k
with  c),  are  signs  of  impending  cell  death.  by  p22
(fig. 2f, i, l), large proportions of gc and pc popula-
tions in the cerebellar cortex have already disappeared.
concomitant to the loss of pc-bodies, the majority of
pc-wbres and axonal varicosities have also disappeared
by  p22  (fig. 2l).  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  postnatal
week (p28), only remnants of gcs, pcs (fig. 2g, j), and
axonal swellings (fig. 2m) remain in the cerebellar cor-
tex. although further progression of cell loss could be
observed from p28 until around p52 (not shown), the
small number of remaining neurones at p28 precludes
a high rate of cell death during this period.
chronology of caspase-3 activation in the cerebellum 
of lc/+ mutants
from  the  above  histologically  documented  neuronal
loss,  we  expected  that  the  highest  rate  of  cell  death
should  appear  during  the  third  and  fourth  postnatal

tonic boundaries are delineated by dots (d, q–s). nissl-staining in
lc/+ mutants (e–g) documents a massive gc loss between p14
and p28, when compared to a wild type (a) at p14. anti-calbindin
d-28k  demonstrates  the  disappearance  of  the  majority  of  pcs
from p14 to p28 in lc/+ mutants (h–j), compared to the wild type
(b). higher magniwcation of calbindin d-28k labelled pcs (k–m)
exhibits numerous swellings and torpedo-like structures (arrow-
heads)  in pc-axons of lc/+ mutants, not usually present in the
wild type (c). caspase-3 (n, o) is activated in pcs (arrows) and in
gcs (arrowheads) of lc/+ mutants at p14 and p22, whereas only
some gcs but no pcs are labelled at p28 (p). fj-b staining in wild
types (d) resulted in the lack of intense xuorescence signals in any
cerebellar cell type or structure. fj-b selectively highlights pcs
(arrows) in lc/+ mutants (q–v), including their cell bodies, den-
dritic trees and axonal swellings (arrowheads) in the white sub-
stance. this is apparent at all ages examined (t–v). no gcs were
stained with fj-b. gcl granule cell layer, ml molecular layer, p

tion bars provide the scale as follows: 100 ♯m (d, n, o, p, q, r, s)

weeks. this expectation was met by patterns of casp-3
activation  observed 
in  pcs  and  gcs  (fig. 2n–p;
table 1).  casp-3  positive  pcs  and  gcs  were  present
only  in  the  two  narrow  periods  ranging  from  p14  to
p22,  and  from  p14  to  p28.  approximately  three  such
casp-3  labelled  pcs  and  about  ten  gcs  per  section
could  be  detected  at  p14  in  the  lc/+  cerebellum
(table 1).  during  the  third  postnatal  week  (i.e.  from
p14  to  p22),  the  number  of  casp-3  labelled  pcs
increased slightly. it reached its maximum value of 4.2
pcs per section at p22 (level of signiwcance: p = 0.19).
in  contrast,  the  number  of  casp-3  labelled  gcs
increased  about  20-fold  (p < 0.0005)  during  the  third
postnatal week, with a maximum of 183 labelled gcs
per section observed at p22. the most prominent rela-
tive increase of labelled pcs occurred between p14 and
p16, whereas the strongest increase in the percentage
of casp-3 positive gcs was about 3 days later. in older
lc/+  mice,  the  incidence  of  casp-3  positive  cells
decreased  in  both  populations,  in  fact,  not  a  single
immunolabelled pc and very few immunopositive gcs
(p < 0.0005; fig. 2p, table 1) could be detected in any
of the three animals at p28. in summary, the chronol-
ogy  of  casp-3  activation  closely  parallels  the  time
course of  degeneration  as determined  from  the  histo-
logical observations described in the previous section.
the  period  of  highest  prevalence  of  dying  pcs  and
gcs  at  p14  to  p28  coincides  with  that  of  casp-3
positive  pcs  and  gcs.  the  apparent  cell  death  rate
peaks at around p22.
fj-b labelling in the cerebellum of wild types 
and lc/+ mutants
in  all  sections  and  at  all  postnatal  ages  investigated
(shown  only  for  p14  in  fig. 2d),  the  cerebella  of  wild
types showed only very faint background labelling but no
discernible xuorescence signal that could be attributed to
a neuronal phenotype. apart from the neuronal staining

in lc/+ mutants described below, fj-b also appeared to
label meninges, red blood cells and the choroid plexus.
this we observed in both mutant and wild type mice of
any age and independent of the state of neurodegenera-
tion, thus conwrming earlier reports [42, 43].
in lc/+ mutants, fj-b labelling was restricted to pcs
and  their  processes.  it  was  never  found  in  gcs  at  any
age investigated (fig. 2q, r, s). this is in a sharp contrast
to  casp-3  immunohistochemistry,  which  labelled  many
gcs  in  the  progressively  thinning  gc-layer  within  the
period from p14 to p28 (fig. 2e–g; table 1).
fj-b  positive  pcs  became  wrst  visible  at  p14
(fig. 2q) and their incidence was very similar to that of
casp-3  labelled  pcs  (table 1).  the  number  of  fj-b
stained  pcs  continuously  increased  between  p14  and
p22  before  reaching  the  maximum  at  p22,  which
exceeded  the  number  at  p14  more  than  tenfold
(p < 0.0005;  table 1).  in  older  animals,  the  rate  of
labelled pcs at p28 declined below seven pcs per sec-
tion (p < 0.0005) (fig. 2s; table 1). this rate continued
declining  until  not  a  single  positive  pc  could  be
detected in the cerebellum at p32.
chronological incidence and morphology of casp-3 
and fj-b labelled pcs
the number of fj-b stained pcs exceeded that of casp-
3  labelled  pcs  at  any  postnatal  age  investigated.  this
diverence in incidence has increased with age, reaching
a  maximum  at  p22  where  the  ratio  of  casp-3  positive
pcs  to fj-b  labelled pcs reached 1:8.5. the postnatal
period in which pcs activated casp-3 appeared earlier
and  was  shorter  than  the  period  characterized  by
observable fj-b positive pcs. not a single casp-3 posi-
tive pc was detected at p28, where less than 5% of pcs
still remain in the cerebellum of lc/+ mutants [6, 18, 48,
52,  53]  (fig. 2j).  however,  at  p28  the  number  of  fj-b
stained pcs remained higher than that of casp-3 stained
pcs at their peak of incidence around p22.
fj-b  stained  pc  somata  and  dendrites  appeared
swollen  and  these  pcs  frequently  showed  signs  of
disintegration (fig. 2t–v, q–s), reminiscent of the mor-
phology that is characteristic for an advanced phase of
degeneration. in many cases, fragmented or detached
pc  dendrites  and  somata  were  labelled  by  fj-b.  we
identiwed these fragments as of pc origin on the basis
of their locality and spatial arrangement in the molecu-
lar layer (fig. 2q–s). signs of fragmentation were virtu-
ally  absent  in  casp-3  labelled  pcs  (fig. 2n,  o),  which
were  morphologically  similar  to  calb-positive  pcs
(fig. 2k–m). in contrast to casp-3, which failed to rec-
ognise axonal processes or varicosities of degenerating
pcs,  fj-b  stained  not  only  pc-bodies  and  dendrites
acta neuropathol (2006) 112:691–702
697
but  also  axons  together  with  their  characteristic
swellings  (arrowheads  in  figs. 2q–s,  3).  transpassing
pc-wbres  were  also  seen  in  the  gc-layer.  only  occa-
sionally  did  these  wbres  show  one  or  more  of  the
varicosities characteristic for lc/+ pcs.
fj-b labelling in the projection pathways and targets 
of purkinje cells
fj-b stained degenerating pc-axons along their com-
plete  route  from  the  cerebellar  cortex  through  the
white substance (fig. 3a) to the deep cerebellar and the
vestibular  nuclei.  this  staining  also  included  terminal
arborizations  and  synaptic  boutons  in  the  pc  projec-
tion targets of the deep cerebellar (fig. 3c) and vestib-
ular  nuclei  (fig. 3e).  fj-b  positive  wbres  and  axonal
swellings were most abundantly labelled in the cerebel-
lar  white  substance  (fig. 3a)  and  the  deep  cerebellar
nuclei (fig. 3c) but much less so in the vestibular nuclei
(fig. 3e).  although  the  density  of  these  wbres  succes-
sively decreased with the increasing extent of the pc-
loss in the cerebellar cortex, some fj-b labelled axonal
segments and varicosities were still present in the white
substance and in the cerebellar projection targets long
after  all  the  somata  in  the  pc-layer  had  disappeared.
this observation indicates a protracted form of axonal
degeneration in lc/+ mutants. the route, morphology
and  chronological  appearance  of  fj-b  labelled  wbres
and  swellings,  together  with  their  close  similarity  to
calb-immunolabelled  pc-axons  on  adjacent  sections
(fig. 3b,  d,  f),  strongly  suggest  that  these  wbres  origi-
nate from degenerating pcs.
cell loss, casp-3 activation and fj-b labelling 
in the inferior olive of lc/+ mutants
an atrophy of the io complex, characterised with calb
labelling in age-matched wild types and lc/+ mutants,
became apparent already at  p14 (compare fig. 4a, c).
cell  death  of  io-neurones  proceeded  after  p14,  dra-
matically reducing the  size of the io complex by p22
(fig. 4b, d).
however, activation of casp-3 was detected only in
few io-neurones. their incidence never exceeded one

reduction at p22 (b, d). repre-

immunopositive neurone per section at any age studied
(fig. 4e, f). similarly, fj-b seemed to be even less par-
tial for staining dying io-neurones in adjacent sections.
in  fact,  fj-b  failed  to  label  any  single  io-neurone  in
lc/+ mutants at any postnatal age between p6 and p67
(representative sections are shown in fig. 4 for p14 and
p22).
casp-3 activation and fj-b labelling during 
developmental cell loss
to examine whether fj-b can label neurones that per-
ish  as  a  result  of  normal  postnatal  development,  we
attempted  to  label  adjacent  sections  taken  from  the
brains  of  wild  types  and  lc/+  mutants  with  fj-b  and
anti-cleaved-casp-3 at p6. neurones densely immuno-
labelled by antibodies against cleaved casp-3 appeared
not  only  in  the  cerebellum  (fig. 5d,  e)  but  were  also
scattered  throughout  other  brain  areas  (fig. 5a–c)  of
wild types as well as lc/+ mutants. fj-b, on the other
hand,  failed  to  label  any  neurones  in  the  equivalent
brain areas at p6 in any of the three wild types and lc/
+ mutants.
discussion
here  we  present  the  wrst  complete  time  course  of
casp-3 and fj-b labelling in the lc/+ mutant from the
beginning (at p6) to the cessation (at p67) of neurode-
123
generation in the cerebellum and inferior olive. this is
also the wrst comparative study documenting the selec-
tive ability of these two markers to label dying neuro-
nes under neurodegenerative conditions with a known
time  course  and  extent  of  degeneration  in  identiwed
cell populations. moreover, we demonstrated the abil-
ity of casp-3 and fj-b to label neurones that are sorted
out  during  the  course  of  normal  development  in  the
murine brain.
the clear diverences among the patterns and chro-
nologies of labelling obtained with casp-3 and fj-b in
the  lc/+  mutant  over  several  new  insights  into  the
diversity  and  relative  importance  of  the  diverent
modes  of  cell  death  operative  in  the  cerebellum  and
brainstem of this mutant as well as into the speciwcity
of  the  markers  for  any  of  the  major  cell  death  path-
ways.
the narrow time window in which casp-3 labelling
was  present  in  the  cerebellum,  the  scarcity  of
labelled pcs and gcs and the almost total absence of
labelled  io  neurones  indicates  that  this  protease  is
not activated in all degenerating neurons in the lc/+
mutant. these results agree with, as well as augment
previous  observations,  that  during  the  phase  of  the
most pronounced degeneration (p15 to p20) in lc/+
mutants there is an increased expression of pro-cas-
pase-3 in the minority (about 25%) of pcs and acti-
vated  casp-3  is  detectable  in  even  fewer  pcs  [44].
hence,  casp-3  activation  does  not  predominantly
mediate the primary cell death in the pc population

all images were adjusted for 
brightness and contrast
in lc/+ mutants. nor does it play any major role dur-
ing  secondary  transsynaptic  degeneration  of  gcs
and io neurones.
this  low  incidence  of  casp-3  labelled  pcs  sharply
contrasts  with  more  plentiful  pcs  labelled  with  fj-b.
the ability of fj-b to label pcs also extended beyond
the  p14  to  p22  period,  where  no  pcs  could  be  evec-
tively stained with antibodies against activated casp-3.
despite  the  apparent  multitude  of  fj-b-positive  pcs,
in comparison to the evidence for the death of the com-
plete pc population in lc/+ mutants, the stained cells
may  not  represent  all  dying  pcs  at  that  period.  this
possibility is also indicated by the diverent morphology
of casp-3 and fj-b labelled pcs. the evidence for this
apparent scarcity of labelled cells leads to the inevita-
ble conclusion that neither casp-3 nor fj-b is able to
highlight  all  pcs  undergoing  degeneration.  the  same
conclusion can be made about the transsynaptic degen-
eration of gcs and io neurones, because the number
of casp-3 labelled gcs is very low in comparison to the
degeneration of 90% of the complete gc population.
furthermore, in the io, casp-3 labelled neurones were
almost  completely  absent.  from  these  observations  it
appears  that  the  diversity  of  death  mechanisms  that
operate  in  the  lc/+  mutant  is  higher  than  hitherto
assumed.
the  death  of  pcs  was  recently  attributed  to  the
operation  of  autophagic  mechanisms  in  lc/+  mutants
[55]  because  of  the  linkage  of  the  mutated  glur♥2lc
with beclin1 and the presence of autophagic vacuoles
in lc/+ pcs in vivo [55]. however, pcs in lc/+ mutants
are insulted at least twice, by activation of autophagy
via the glur♥2lc [55] and by excitotoxicity, caused by
the  gain-of-function  of  this  receptor  [58].  moreover,
beclin1  has  also  been  suggested  as  a  potential  link
between autophagy and apoptosis [32, 55], pointing to
the possibility that autophagic and apoptotic pathways
may be interrelated.
in  synopsis  with  the  chronological  incidence  of
casp-3 and fj-b labelled pcs, gcs and io neurones,
the implication of the above observations is that multi-
ple  cell-death  pathways  are  activated  in  parallel  and
that a substantial number of pcs and gcs, and virtu-
ally  all  io  neurones,  die  via  pathways  that  neither
123
700
acta neuropathol (2006) 112:691–702
necessitate  casp-3  activation  nor  provide  the  targets
necessary for fj-b binding.
contrary to prevailing assumptions that fj-b stains
all degenerating neurones, irrespective of their death
pathway [41, 42], only a small portion of all dying neu-
rones could be labelled by fj-b in lc/+ mutants. the
apparent  scarcity  of  fj-b  labelling  may  rexect  its
selectivity for various modes of cell death rather than
for a particular cell type because fj-b is a very evec-
tive  label  for  dying  pcs  and  gcs  of  leaner  mutants
[15]  and  3-acetylpyridine  treated  necrotic  io  neuro-
nes  [28].  from  the  available  reports  it  appears  that
fj-b is in certain cases unable to stain apoptotic neu-
rones as documented in the rat spinal cord damaged
by a moderate mechanical contusion [1, 10, 40] and in
the  dorsal  root  ganglia  after  acrylamide  treatment
[28] that is known to cause degeneration of peripheral
nerve wbres [34].
in  the  present  study,  the  apparent  lack  of  fj-b
labelling in lc/+ gcs and io neurones, both consid-
ered  to  die  via  apoptotic  pathways  (for  review  see
[51]), and the subtotal labelling of the dying pc popu-
lation,  indicate  that  the  selectivity  of  fj-b  appears
higher  than  previously  assumed.  in  particular,  those
apoptotic neurons that undergo cell death via casp-3
activation seem to be spared from fj-b labelling. this
assumption is further supported by extensive casp-3
labelling and the absence of any fj-b labelled neu-
rones  in  the  normal  murine  brain  at  p6,  where  the
normal  developmental  cell  death  is  well  in  progress
[36, 51, 54].
the outstanding question is what type of molecular
targets,  expressed  only  by  dying  neurones,  is  actually
labelled by fj-b. apparently, the vast majority of stim-
uli leading to fj-b positive degeneration entails neuro-
toxicants, ischaemia, excitotoxicity, surgical trauma, or
neuronal  overactivation  (for  references  see  introduc-
tion). such noxious stimuli interfere with intracellular
homeostasis and the eventual bioenergetic breakdown
triggers apoptosis [50]. the loss of intracellular integ-
rity and/or a homeostatic imbalance are consequences
of lysosomal self-degradation in the course of hyperac-
tivated autophagy [2, 35, 46] but are also observed dur-
ing necrosis [35]. the  potential binding sites for  fj-b
with  aynity  for  molecules  with  multiple  positive
charge groups [42] are almost certainly cationic. con-
ceivably,  the  intracellular  availability  of  such  binding
sites increases as cell death or cell defence mechanisms
produce  more  positively  charged  molecules.  other
options such as a disruption of intracellular homeosta-
sis possibly altering the intracellular ph or the redox-
state  of  latent  targets  may  also  provide  the  substrate
for fj-b binding.
123
however,  such  extreme  conditions  are  unnecessary
for  activating  apoptotic  pathways  in  the  transsynaptic
degeneration of gcs and io neurones in lc/+ mutants,
where the withdrawal of retrograde trophic interactions
in  otherwise “healthy” neurones is suycient to trigger
the  event  [58].  the  subsequent  lysosomal  degradation
in transsynaptic degeneration proceeds via phagocytosis
rather than via autolysis [2, 24, 46]. hence, this mode of
apoptosis, similar to the mechanism supposedly operat-
ing during development [59], probably removes cells by
phagocytosis  in  the  absence  of  any  major  homeostatic
and/or biochemical imbalance.
fj-b labelling in lc/+ pcs includes cell bodies, den-
drites  and  axonal  arborizations,  terminating  in  the
deep  cerebellar  and  vestibular  nuclei,  all  of  which
exhibiting the typical swellings. this property of fj-b
not  only  revealed  a  protracted  loss  of  innervation  in
the pc projection targets in lc/+ brains but also indi-
cates that cellular disintegration may represent a pre-
requisite for the binding of this compound.
the advanced morphological signs of degeneration,
in particular an apparent cell fragmentation, that cha-
racterise  fj-b  positive  lc/+  pcs  but  not  casp-3
labelled pcs indicate that fj-b predominantly binds to
non-apoptotic,  i.e.  necrotic  and  autophagic  neurons.
this  diverence  in  the  morphology,  together  with  the
much  higher  incidence  of  fj-b  labelled  pcs,  implies
that the majority of fj-b labelled pcs undergoes casp-
3 independent death. thus, fj-b appears to preferen-
tially bind molecular targets in those pcs that are in a
terminal stage of death and this particular death stage
is apparently absent in the casp-3 dependent apoptotic
pathway.
in  conclusion,  only  a  minority  of  dying  pcs,  gcs
and io neurones may undergo casp-3 mediated apop-
tosis in lc/+ mutants. the majority of pcs, a fraction
of  the  gc  population,  and  almost  all  io  neurones
therefore  must  die  via  other  pathways.  this  casp-3
independent  cell  death  can  be  highlighted  by  fj-b
labelling in a portion of the pc population but not in
the  transsynaptically-degenerating  gcs,  io  neurones
or in those neurones that are sorted out during devel-
opmental cell death. this diverential pattern of casp-3
and fj-b labelling in lc/+ mutants shows that fj-b is a
much more selective marker than previously assumed
and suggests that cellular overload and disintegration,
as observed in excitotoxicity, autophagy and necrosis,
may provide important prerequisites for fj-b binding.
moreover, the failure of both markers to reveal the full
extent  of  degeneration  caused  by  the  lc/+  mutation
points  out  the  heterogeneity  and  multitude  of  death
pathways active in each of the degenerating cell popu-
lations.
