abstract while the apoptotic and necrotic cell death path-
ways have been well studied, there lacks a comprehen-

tophagic cell death. we examined the potential roles of
the apoptosis-linked caspase-3 and the necrosis/apoptosis-
linked calpain-1 after autophagy induction under prolonged
amino acid (aa) starvation conditions in pc-12 cells. au-
tophagy induction was observed as early as three hours fol-
lowing amino acid withdrawal. cell death, measured by
lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-

introduction
cell death, a highly regulated and well orchestrated pro-
cess, is classiﬁed into three types: apoptotic (type i), au-
tophagic (type ii) and necrotic/oncotic (type iii) [1, 2].
while mechanisms underlying apoptotic cell death have been
well documented [3], autophagic cell death is still poorly
understood. autophagy occurs under stress conditions and
aids in replenishing amino acids by degrading intracellular
macromolecules [4]. it is characterized by the presence of
double membrane vesicles found in the cytoplasm termed
“autophagosomes.” autophagosomes sequester cytoplasmic
constituents including organelles and transport them to lyso-
somes where they are degraded and the amino acids recycled
for rebuilding cellular machinery. deprivation of nutritional
support factors for prolonged periods has been reported to
culminate in autophagic cell death [5, 6].
growth factor or nutrient deprivation mediated autophagic
cell death has been documented in neuronal cell culture sys-
tems [7, 8]. autophagic cell death, a conserved integral path-
way involved in mammalian cell development [9], is also
activated under certain pathological conditions such as the
neurodegenerative diseases [10]. a recent study observed
springer
1574
apoptosis (2006) 11:1573–1582
an upregulation of beclin-1 (atg6), one of the proteins re-
quired for the autophagic process, at the cortical site of injury
in mouse brains following closed head injury [11]. other
recent studies suggest there is evidence for the protective
role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders that are
characterized by aggregate proteins such as huntington’s,
creutzfeldt-jakob and alzheimer’s disease [12–14].
it has long been believed that the two prime protease
families involved in cell death are the calpains [calpain-
1(µ-calpain) and calpain-2 (m-calpain)], activated in both
apoptosis and oncosis, and the caspases, especially caspase-
3, believed to be strictly activated in apoptosis [2,15–
17]. recently there has been increased interest in caspase-
independent cell death pathways [18]. apoptosis and au-
tophagy appear to share certain common regulatory mech-
anisms and may interact in a variety of ways depending
upon the cellular environment and treatments undertaken.
autophagy may play a role in apoptosis either by preceding
and eventually initiating it or by delaying its onset [19, 20].
in other circumstances both pathways may be mutually ex-
clusive [21]. despite the progress made in understanding the
precise molecular mechanisms in autophagy, the processes
that regulate autophagic cell death and its relation to apopto-
sis are still poorly understood [22]. in the present study we
evaluated the activation of caspases and calpains following
amino acid (aa) starvation-induced autophagic cell death in
pc-12 cells.
materials and methods
materials
dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle medium (dmem), earl’s bal-
anced salt solution [(ebss) without calcium or magnesium
fetal bovine serum and horse serum were obtained from
gibco laboratories (carlsbad, ca). staurosporine (sts),
maitotoxin (mtx), monodansylcadaverine (mdc), and
3-methyl adenine (3-ma) were purchased from sigma-
aldrich laboratories (st. louis, mo). prolong antifade
was from molecular probes (eugene, or) while the broad
spectrum caspase inhibitors zvad-fmk (z-val-ala-asp
(ome)-ﬂuoromethyl ketone) and boc-d-fmk (boc- asp ﬂu-
oromethyl ketone) and the calpain inhibitor sja-6017 were
purchased from calbiochem (san diego, ca). serum free
medium (sfm) was comprised of penicillin (60,000 u/l),
streptomycin (60 mg/l) and amphotericin b (250 µg/ml) in
dmem.
cell culture and aa starvation treatment
pc-12 cells were incubated in dmem supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 10% heat-inactivated horse
springer
serum (hs), penicillin (60,000 u/l) and streptomycin
c with
(60 mg/l) and amphotericin b (250 µg/ml) at 37
5% co2. for experimental purposes the cells were plated
in complete medium then at 75–80% conﬂuency they were
washed twice with pbs and incubated in serum free medium
(sfm) with or without maitotoxin (mtx, 0.3 nm), stau-
rosporine (sts, 0.5 µm), or in amino acid deprived medium
earl’s balanced salt solution (ebss), (a starvation media and
autophagy inducer) for the different time points as discussed
for each assay. mtx is a calcium channel opener known to
induce oncosis while sts is a broad spectrum inhibitor of
protein kinases inducing apoptosis [23].
mtt assay
cell death was assayed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. pc-12
cells were plated in 96-well plates equally and incubated at
c for 48 h prior to treatment. at respective time points,
37
the wells were incubated with 15 µl of the dye solution
available in the kit (cell titer 96 r(cid:1)
non-radioactive cell
proliferation assay, promega, madison, wi) for 4 h. after
incubation, 100 µl solubilizing solution available in the kit
was subsequently added to solubilize the formazan crystals
formed in the previous incubation. following the solubiliza-
tion of the formazan crystals, absorbance was read at 570 nm.
lactate dehydrogenase release assay (ldh assay) of
cell death
lactate dehydrogenase release assay was performed to assess
cell death by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase
in the medium from damaged cells due to necrosis and sec-
ondary necrosis following apoptosis [24, 25] or autophagic
cell death. the cells at 80% conﬂuency were incubated in
sfm (control), mtx or sts in sfm or ebss (starvation)
media for a period of 5 days in a 24-well plate. culture
medium, 25 µl, was collected after 0, 3, 6, 12 h and 1, 2, 3
c in 96-well ﬂat bottom plates.
and 5 days and stored at –20
detection reagent (cytotox one reagent, promega) 25 µl
was added to each well containing the culture medium and
incubated for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. fluo-
rescence was measured (excitation wavelength: 560 nm and
emission wavelength: 590 nm) using a ﬂuorescent microplate
reader (spectramax gemini, molecular devices, sunnyvale,
ca). six replicates for each time point per experiment were
assayed and three such experiments were performed. the ar-
bitrary ﬂuorescent unit values were plotted against time. in
a separate set of experiments cells at 80% conﬂuency were
pre-incubated for an hour with and without the following in-
hibitors: 3-ma (10 mm; autophagy inhibitor), z-vad-fmk
(30 µm; caspase inhibitor), boc-d-fmk (30 µm; caspase
inhibitor) and sja-6017 (50 µm; calpain inhibitor) before

incubation in ebss supplemented with the inhibitors. the
samples were then tested by the ldh assay after 12 and 24 h.
six replicates for each time point and for each treatment were
assayed.
mdc labeling of autophagosomes and nuclear
morphology using hoechst 33258 staining
the pc-12 cells were stained with 0.05 mm monodan-
sylcadaverine (mdc) in pbs after 3, 6, 12 h and 1 day
time points at room temperature (rt) for 10 min [26]. the
cells were washed 2x with phosphate buffered saline (pbs),
mounted using antifade solution (prolong antifade, molec-
ular probes) and immediately observed using the zeiss ﬂuo-
rescence microscope. to assess nuclear morphology, the cells
were treated with the appropriate media for either 1 day (sts,
starvation, control) or 3 h (mtx). they were washed twice
with 1x pbs and incubated with hoechst 33258 (0.5 mg/ml)
in pbs at room temperature for 10 min. following incuba-
tion, the cells were washed twice with 1x pbs and observed
under the zeiss ﬂuorescence microscope. apoptotic cells
were characterized by condensed nuclei morphology.
immunocytochemistry
pc-12 cells were plated on collagen i coated coverslips
and at 80% conﬂuency the cells were treated with ebss.
at various experimental time points the cells were ﬁxed
c, washed with
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4
pbs, blocked for 30 min in 5% normal goat serum (ngs)
in tbst and then incubated overnight with lc-3 antibody
c. the bound antibody was subse-
(1:100) in 5% ngs at 4
quently detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit alexa
red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000). the cells were
rinsed twice with 1x pbs and subsequently mounted us-
ing the mounting medium for ﬂuorescence containing dapi
(vectashield, vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) and
viewed under the zeiss ﬂuorescent microscope.
western blot analysis
the pc-12 cell lysates were collected at different time
points after treatment with the appropriate media using lysis
buffer containing 1% triton-x, 5 mm egta, 5 mm edta,
150 mm nacl and 20 mm tris hcl (ph 7.4). the pro-
tein content was determined using dc protein assay (bio-
rad laboratories, hercules, ca) and the protein concen-
tration was standardized to 1 µg/µl. twenty micrograms
of lysate were subjected to sds-page gel electrophore-
sis on 4–12% or 6% tris-glycine gels (invitrogen, carls-
bad, ca) and then transferred onto pvdf membrane on a
semi-dry electro transferring unit (bio-rad laboratories).
following the transfer, the membranes were blocked in 5%
nonfat dry milk in tbst for an hour at room temperature and
c. the
then incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4
primary antibodies included monoclonal mouse anti-αii-
spectrin (afﬁniti, plymouth meeting, pa), polyclonal rabbit
anti-cathepsin b (upstate biotechnology inc., lake placid,
ny) and polyclonal rabbit anti-activated caspase-3 (cell sig-
naling technology, danvers, ma) used at 1:4000 and 1:1000
dilutions, respectively. the sbdp120 and sbdp150 and
the activated calpain-1 antibodies were designed and then
generated by immunizing rabbits against a synthetic pep-
tides corresponding to the amino acids in the n-terminal
with an additional cysteine (sveal-c6-c, gmmpr-c6-
c and lgrhenac respectively). anti-lc-3 antibody was
raised by immunizing rabbits against a klh-coupled syn-
thetic peptide corresponding to amino acids in the n-terminal
with an additional cysteine (psdrpfkqrrsfadc). the
following day, the membranes were washed with 1x tris
buffered saline with tween-20 (tbst) and probed with
either secondary peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit or bi-
otinylated anti-mouse antibody for one hour (1:1000). im-
munoreactivity was detected by either using streptavidin al-
kaline phosphatase conjugate tertiary antibody (1:1000) or
enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) reaction (amersham
biosciences, piscataway, nj). densitometric quantiﬁcation
of the bands was performed using imagej software (version
1.29x; nih, bethesda, md).
caspase-3 activity assay
pc-12 cells were incubated in ebss (starvation) and sfm
(control) treatment conditions for set periods of time to de-
termine the caspase-3 activity. caspase-3 activity was per-
formed using a apo-one r(cid:1)
caspase-3 activity assay kit
(promega). the cells were incubated in the apo-one r(cid:1)
caspase-3 reagent for 2 h and ﬂuorescence was read at excita-
tion wavelength of 485± 20 nm and an emission wavelength
of 530± 25 nm.
statistical analysis
pairwise comparisons were made using the student’s t-test
while one-way anova with tukey post hoc test was used
to draw comparisons between multiple groups. data was
plotted as means± sem (standard error of the mean). a
value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.

balanced salt solution (ebss; aa deprived cells) for 3, 6,
12 h, were subsequently incubated with monodansycadaver-
ine (mdc; 0.05 mm), a ﬂuorescent marker for autophago-
somes [26] and analyzed for autophagosomes using ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy (fig. 1(a)). the starved cells showed
mdc labeled autophagosomes as early as 3 h and these per-
sisted for at least 12 h while the sfm treated cells showed
little to no mdc incorporation. this is consistent with pre-
viously reported results [27] demonstrating autophagy in-
duction under aa starvation conditions. to further conﬁrm
autophagy, immunostaining with lc-3, a mammalian homo-
logue of yeast atg8 which associates with autophagosome
membranes [28] was performed (fig. 1(b)). lc-3 expression
appeared more intense in aa starved cells when compared
to control cells at the various time periods examined. these
results conﬁrm induction of autophagy in pc-12 cells under
aa starvation conditions.
prolonged amino acid starvation induces cell death and
evidence of αii-spectrin breakdown
having established autophagy induction following aa de-
privation, we hypothesized that prolonged aa starvation
would eventually lead to autophagic cell death. to assess
cell death, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release assay was
performed and the ﬂuorimetric readings at different time
points were plotted (fig. 2(a)). amino acid deprived cells
incubated in ebss (starv) were able to survive the initial pe-
riods of starvation. however, amino acid deprivation, when
prolonged for 24 h or more, resulted in an increase in cell
death when compared to controls. the cell death time course
was similar to that induced by sts treatment. in contrast
cells treated with mtx showed rapid cell death peaking as
early as 3 h. also observed was an upward trend in cell death
in the control cells after approximately 80 h of incubation.
these results suggest that aa deprived cells are protected
from cell death at earlier time points by the induction of
autophagy but prolonged starvation results in cell death. to
conﬁrm the ldh data we also performed the mtt assay
for cell viability. the cell death pattern observed among
the amino acid deprived cells (starv) was similar to that in-
duced by sts treatment and coincided with the ldh data
(fig. 2(b)).
to study the possible activation of caspases and calpains
in starvation induced autophagy, cell lysates for the differ-
ent treatments were collected at various time points and
analyzed by western blot analysis. we examined the cy-
toskeletal protein, αii-spectrin, a well established substrate
cleaved by both calpains and caspases under cell death con-
ditions [29]. when compared to control, lysates from the
aa starved cells showed an increase in spectrin breakdown
products 120 kda (sbdp120) and 150 kda (sbdp150) day
1 through day 5 (fig. 2(c)). while the observed sbdp150
band can be representative of either calpain (sbdp150) or
caspase-3 (sbdp150i) mediated proteolysis, the sbdp120
proteolytic fragment is caspase-3 speciﬁc [29]. the mtx
and sts treated cell lysates used as positive controls for cal-
pain and caspase-3 speciﬁc spectrin proteolysis showed cal-
pain speciﬁc sbdp150 and 145 and caspase speciﬁc bands
sbdp120 and sbdp150i, respectively (fig. 2(c)).

further examined the roles of calpain-1 and caspase-3 in

death, respectively. the expressed values are the mean ± sem (n =
6). (b) cell death was also conﬁrmed using mtt assay. the expressed
αii-spectrin breakdown and autophagy. the cell lysates ob-
tained from the different treatments were probed with an
antibody speciﬁc for sbdp150 which in our previous stud-
ies have shown to be calpain speciﬁc [29, 30]. there was no
detectable increase in the sbdp150 levels in the starved cells
even at the time points when cell death was observed. the
mtx (3 h) and sts (1 day) treated positive controls showed
that the antibody is able to detect the calpain-mediated
sbdp150 (fig. 3(a)). subsequently, the antibody speciﬁc
for activated calpain-1 was used to directly determine its pos-
sible activation in aa starved cells as compared to cells incu-
bated in sfm. as expected, activated calpain-1 was clearly
detected after mtx and sts treatment, as positive controls.
in contrast, aa deprived treatment conditions showed the
complete absence of calpain-1 activation (fig. 3(b)).
caspase-3 activation under aa starvation conditions was
also assessed indirectly by measuring the levels of sbdp120
using a caspase-3 speciﬁc anti-sbdp120 antibody [29, 30].
increases in sbdp120 levels were ﬁrst observed to be sig-
niﬁcant by densitometric analysis in aa starved cells at 12 h
and this signiﬁcance persisted for the 2 days (p < 0.005;
student’s t-test), the time limit of our study, when com-
pared to the untreated controls. a signiﬁcant increase in the
values are the mean ± sem (n = 4). (c) representative blots (n =

respectively. sbdp150i is the breakdown product mediated by caspases

ment (starv) and control conditions (ctrl). there was no sbdp150

positive controls

conditions. (a) densitometric analysis of immunoblots of sbdp120
indicates caspases play a statistically signiﬁcant role in spectrin break-
down under amino acid starvation (starv) versus control (ctrl) condi-
tions as evaluated from 12 h to 2 days. staurosporine (sts) treated cells
represent positive control for caspase-3 mediated spectrin breakdown.
student’s t-test was performed to evaluate statistical signiﬁcance,
< 0.005; mean ± sem; n = 3. (b) densitometric analysis of ac-
tivated caspase-3 showed signiﬁcant increases under amino acid star-
intensity of sbdp120 was observed in sts treated cells
when compared to controls and this increase was compara-
ble to the intensities observed in the aa starved cells (1 day)
(fig. 4(a)).
the direct approach to examine caspase-3 activation in
starved cells was by immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates
for activated caspase-3. activated caspase-3 bands (19 kda,
17 kda) were detectable in starved cells from 12 h on-
ward and densitometry analysis showed a signiﬁcant in-
crease (p < 0.005) by day 2. the expression levels at day
1, while showing a notable upward trend was not statisti-
cal signiﬁcant. the activated caspase-3 levels were com-
parable between the sts treated and aa starved cells (1
day) (fig. 4(b)). to further substantiate the presence of
springer
vation (starv) versus control (ctrl) conditions by 2 days. sts treated
cells represent positive control for activated caspase-3 expression (17
and 19 kda). student’s t-test was performed to evaluate statistical
p < 0.005; mean ± sem; n = 3). β-actin acts as a
signiﬁcance,
protein loading control indicating even protein loading. (c) caspase-

caspase-3, following prolonged starvation, caspase-3 ac-
tivity was assayed using the apo-one r(cid:1)
caspase-3 assay.
caspase-3 activity in starved cells was signiﬁcantly higher
than the control cells (fig. 4(c)). it peaked at day 1 fol-
lowing starvation which correlates with the immunoblot
data.
activation of cathepsins following starvation
cathepsin b activation had previously been shown to translo-
cate into the cytosol during apoptosis [40]. canu et al. (2005)
recently demonstrated that the cathepsin b translocation into
the cytosol was not due to a compromise in the lysosomal
membrane integrity or function but was rather cathepsin b
apoptosis (2006) 11:1573–1582
1579
fig. 5 activation of cathepsin b following starvation. representative
immunoblot shows that the cleaved activated form of cathepsin b
(30 kda) from whole lysates of cells peaks at 3 and 6 h following
starvation prior to returning to normal. cells treated with sfm were
employed as controls (n = 2)
independent. since autophagy involves lysosomal enzyme
activation, the activation of cathepsin b, a lysosomal hydro-
lase, during the process of starvation was investigated. we
observed activation of activation of cathepsin b at the earlier
stages of starvation (3 and 6 h). this activation appeared to
cease at the later time periods when cell death was observed
(fig. 5).
prolonged amino acid starvation induced nuclear
morphology and autophagosome abnormalities
to assess nuclear morphology as a measure of cell death
following aa starvation, pc-12 cells were maintained un-
der the different conditions for 1 day and then stained with
the hoechst 33258 nuclear dna stain. both sts treated
and aa starved cells demonstrated the characteristic dna
condensation accompanied by the collapse and shrinkage of
the nucleus. control cells, on the other hand, maintained
the well deﬁned oval nuclear morphology of a healthy cell
with diffused dna. in the mtx treated cells a more non-
speciﬁc disintegration of the dna was observed (fig. 6(a)).
furthermore, in the cells deprived of aa, mdc-positive
autophagosomes were seen at day 1. this indicates that au-
tophagy is still taking place in the cells even though cell
death is occurring (fig. 6(b)). the autophagosomes that
were previously well deﬁned punctuate stains (fig. 1(a))
were observed as intensely stained aggregates mostly sur-
rounding the shrunken nucleus at day 1. cells incubated in
sfm or treated with sts for the same time periods did not
show a comparable density of mdc positive cells (fig. 5(b)).
these results are consistent with previous studies that have
implicated apoptotic processes in cell death as a conse-
quence of autophagic induction under certain stress stimuli
[20, 31].
amino acid starvation mediated cell death is suppressed
by autophagy inhibitors but not caspase or calpain
inhibitors
to further evaluate the role of autophagy and caspases and
calpains in starvation-induced cell death, we incubated pc12
cells in ebss with and without 3-methyladenine (3-ma; au-
tophagy inhibitor), zvad-fmk and boc-d-fmk (two broad
spectrum caspase inhibitors), and sja-6017 (calpain in-
hibitor). the ldh assay performed at 12 and 24 h post
treatment showed that starvation-induced cell death signiﬁ-
cantly decreased with 3-ma treatment (p < 0.05) (fig. 7(a)
fig. 6 hoechst 33258 nuclear and mdc staining of cells under differ-
ent treatment conditions. (a) hoechst 33258 staining was performed
to observe the nuclear morphology at day 1 for cells incubated under
amino acid starvation (starv), control (ctrl), sts and mtx (3 h) treat-
ment conditions. apoptotic nuclear morphology is represented by sts
(1 day) treated cells while mtx (3 h) treatment represents positive con-
trol for necrosis. arrows indicate condensed dna. (b) mdc stained

cation and scale bar represents 20 µm. insert represent (2x) the region

and (b)). surprisingly, the protective effects of caspase in-
hibitor z-vad was marginal (less than 10%) and not statis-
tically signiﬁcant following prolonged aa starvation. the
other broad spectrum caspase inhibitor boc-d fmk failed to
show any protection. also, there was no protection from cal-

suggest that calpain is not involved in cell death due to aa
starvation. also, the treatment with 3-ma (10 mm) alone and
in combination z-vad resulted in a robust and signiﬁcant
protection against cell death following aa starvation. cell
lysates analyzed for sbdp120 by immunoblotting showed a
complete loss of sbdp120 expression in cells treated with
broad spectrum caspase inhibitors, ma treatment and a com-
bination of both 3-ma with z-vad (fig. 7(c)). since cell
death was strongly inhibited with the 3-ma treatment alone
and considering the morphological data in fig. 5 it appears
that cell death occurring under aa starvation conditions in
pc-12 cells is mediated through autophagy and can be clas-
siﬁed as type ii autophagic cell death.
discussion
autophagy has been described as a cellular response to
stressful stimuli like starvation. one of its primary functions
is to recycle amino acids from degraded proteins for cellular
survival under nutrient deprived conditions [32–34]. pc-12
cells have been acknowledged as a neuronal cell line since
they respond reversibly to nerve growth factor (ngf) stimu-
lation and acquire sympathetic neuronal phenotype capable
of producing cathecholamines as neurotransmitters [8]. in
this study we demonstrated autophagy induction in pc-12
cells under amino acid starvation conditions (fig. 1). also,
we showed that prolonged starvation resulted in 3-ma sen-
sitive autophagic cell death (fig. 7) a process that shares
certain common features with the apoptotic pathway (fig. 4
and 6).
autophagosomes, double membrane vesicles, have been
considered to be one of the hallmark features of autophagy.
these autophagosomes induced under conditions of stress,
are responsible for engulﬁng cytosolic organelles and fusing
with lysosomes where the engulfed proteins are dismantled
into their constituent amino acids. the amino acids are then
recycled within the cell [35]. autophagosomes, previously
reported to accumulate mdc, an autophagolysosome marker
[36, 37], were detected as early as 3 h in amino acid starved
cells but were not found in the control cells or cells treated
with either sts or mtx. while the autophagosomes were
observed as punctuate stains at earlier time periods following
starvation, these punctuate markers were later transformed
into condensed aggregates around the perinuclear region of

the cells. these changes in the morphology of the mdc
positive autophagosomes were coincident with the increases
observed in cell death and the breakdown of αii-spectrin
(fig. 2). autophagosome formation was substantiated by
the co-localization of mdc with a processed form, lc3-
ii, of microtubule-associated protein lc-3, a mammalian
homologue of yeast atg8 which also associates with outer
membrane of the autophagosomes [28, 36]. the lc-3 la-
beling of phenotypically normal autophagosomes was like-
wise observed as early as three hours following starvation
(fig. 1(b)).
to determine the involvement of caspases and calpains,
following aa starvation mediated cell death, the proteolytic
fragments of αii-spectrin were studied. the αii-spectrin
fragmentation pattern is used as a biomarker to speciﬁcally
identify the role of calpains and caspase-3 in cell death [29].
calpain-1 was of interest due to its role as one of the prime
proteases responsible for oncotic cell death and to a lesser
extent of apoptotic cell death [17]. calpain-1 has also previ-
ously been found to induce cleavage and release of apoptosis
inducing factor (aif), in a caspase independent fashion, trig-
gering the apoptotic pathway [38]. in examining the role of
calpains in aa starvation mediated cell death, there was no
increase of calpain-speciﬁc spectrin breakdown product of
150 kda (sbdp150) (fig. 3(a)). this was conﬁrmed by the
lack of increase of the activated form of calpain-1 (fig. 3(b)).
cells treated with mtx, as positive control for oncotic cell
death, showed strong calpain activation. these observations
pose some interesting questions and the need for further in-
vestigation as the cellular concentration of calcium appears
to be adequate to activate these proteases. it should be noted
that the ebss starvation media does not provide extracel-
lular ca2+
) and this may play a role in the lack
of calpain activation under starvation conditions. this may
suggest that the release of internal stores of ca2+
, if involved,
is insufﬁcient to generate sustained calpain activation in aa
starvation induced cell death.
(or mg2+
to address the involvement of caspases in cell death after
prolonged aa starvation, additional tests were performed.
the caspase-3 activity assay showed there was considerable
caspase-3 activity (fig. 4(c)) and this was conﬁrmed by im-
munoblots for caspase-3 mediated sbdp120 and activated
caspase-3 (fig. 4(a) and (b)). these results initially sug-
gested caspase-3 activation may play a role in autophagic cell
death. in addition, nuclear morphology changes highlighted
by hoechst 33258 staining were comparable between the aa
starved cells and those treated with sts (a known apoptosis
inducer) at the same time point the aggregated mdc positive
autophagosomes were observed in the cells (fig. 6). while
cathepsin b activation was observed at the early stages in the
cytoplasm following starvation, the leaking of the lysosomal
protease into the cytoplasm was limited to starvation periods
up to 6 h but not later suggesting that the lysosomal hydro-
lase is not a participant in the cell death process [39]. also
the lysosomal membrane integrity appears to remain intact,
as the protease was not observed in the cytosol following
prolonged periods of starvation. taken together, these data
imply that starvation induced autophagic cell death shares
common features with classic apoptosis.
the ldh assay studies of inhibitor treated cell cultures
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in cell death in the presence of
the inhibitor 3-ma. the data also showed a robust decrease in
the levels of caspase-3 mediated sbdp120 following 3-ma
treatment suggesting that autophagy precedes caspase-3 ac-
tivation. these ﬁndings appear to be in agreement with a pre-
vious study which had demonstrated inhibition of apoptotic
markers following 3-ma treatment [20]. the two broad spec-
trum caspase inhibitors, zvad and boc-d, however, did not
show signiﬁcant protection from cell death under starvation
conditions within the time frame examined. this is consis-
tent with previous ﬁndings [8] which demonstrated that treat-
ment of nerve growth factor deprived sympathetic neurons
treated with pan-caspase inhibitors prevented the morpho-
logical changes that are characteristic of apoptosis, but did
not prevent cell death nor did they affect autophagic activity.
our data shows that both broad spectrum caspases inhibitors
fully suppressed the formation of sbdp120 band (fig. 7(c).
the results suggest there is an activation of caspase-3 in
autophagic cell death, but the inhibition of caspase-3 is not
sufﬁcient by itself to protect against this form of cell death.
while we and others have demonstrated that concurrent with
caspase-3 activation there is calpain activation in most forms
of classical apoptosis including sts treatment (fig. 4) and
ngf deprivation in pc-12 cells [29], our results demon-
strated that autophagic cell death following aa starvation
does not activate calpain nor does it seem to be required
(fig. 3). the data suggests a subtle but important differ-
ences between apoptosis (type i) and autophagic cell death
(type ii).
conclusion
in summary, prolonged aa starvation induces autophagic
cell death in a rat neuronal-like cell type (pc-12). while
beneﬁcial early following stress activation, at some point,
autophagy unchecked will begin to damage the cellular mi-
tochondria and other vital organelles necessary for its con-
tinued survival resulting in cell death. the neural cell au-
tophagic cell death paradigm described in this study will
allow for further exploration of this form of cell death in
neurological disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain
injury, and neurodegenerative conditions like alzheimer’s
disease.
