abstract
the lysosomal membrane proteins lamp-1 and lamp-2 are estimated to contribute to
about 50% of all proteins of the lysosome membrane. surprisingly, mice deﬁcient in either
lamp-1 or lamp-2 are viable and fertile. however, mice deﬁcient in both lamp-1 and
lamp-2 have an embryonic lethal phenotype. these results show that these two major lyso-
somal membrane proteins share common functions in vivo. however, lamp-2 seems to have
more speciﬁc functions since lamp-2 single deﬁciency has more severe consequences than
lamp-1 single deﬁciency. mutations in lamp-2 gene cause a lysosomal glycogen storage dis-
ease, danon disease, in humans. lamp-2 deﬁcient mice replicate the symptoms found in danon
patients including accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in heart and skeletal muscle. in embry-
onic ﬁbroblasts, mutual disruption of both lamps is associated with an increased accumulation
of autophagic vacuoles and unesteriﬁed cholesterol, while protein degradation rates are not
aﬀected. these results clearly show that the lamp proteins fulﬁl functions far beyond the ini-
tially suggested roles in maintaining the structural integrity of the lysosomal compartment.

1. introduction to lysosomal membrane proteins
lysosomes are acidic, membrane-bound organelles rich in hydrolytic enzymes.
lysosomes are responsible for the degradation of macromolecules derived from
the extracellular space through endocytosis or phagocytosis, as well as from the cyto-
plasm through autophagy. one crucial role of the membrane limiting late endosomes
and lysosomes is to separate the potent activities of lysosomal acid hydrolases from
other cellular constituents. protein components of the lysosomal membrane also
mediate a number of essential functions of this compartment, including the acidiﬁ-
cation of the lysosomal lumen, transport of amino acids, fatty acids, and carbohy-
drates resulting from the hydrolytic degradation, as well as other nutrients
generated by lysosomal hydrolases (eskelinen et al., 2003). in addition, lysosomal
membrane proteins may be involved in the interaction and fusion of the lysosomes
with themselves as well as with other cell components, including endosomes, phago-
somes, and the plasma membrane (fukuda, 1991). several highly glycosylated pro-
teins of the lysosomal membrane have been identiﬁed (hunziker et al., 1996; peters
and von figura, 1994) but their speciﬁc functions are largely unknown. the most
abundant glycoproteins of this membrane were identiﬁed about twenty years ago
as antigens to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. the lysosomal membrane glyco-
proteins lamp-1 and lamp-2 were ﬁrst described by the groups of mellman
(lewis et al., 1985), august (chen et al., 1985), fambrough (lippincott-schwartz
and fambrough, 1986) and sandoval (barriocanal et al., 1986).
lysosome associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1) and lamp-2 are major
protein components of the lysosomal membrane. they are type i transmembrane
proteins with a large luminal domain, one transmembrane domain and a c-terminal
cytoplasmic tail. the conserved cytosolic tails of lamp-1 and lamp-2 are 11 res-
idues long and contain necessary information for their intracellular targeting after
biosynthesis (hunziker et al., 1996). despite their 37% amino acid sequence homol-
ogy, lamp-1 and lamp-2 are distinct proteins which most likely diverged rela-
tively early in evolution as
localisation on diﬀerent
chromosomes (fukuda, 1991). the molecular mass of the polypeptide backbone
of human lamp-1 and lamp-2 is 40–45 kda, however after glycosylation the mass
of the glycoproteins is approximately 120 kda (carlsson et al., 1988; mane et al.,
1989). n-glycosylation seems to be important for the stability of the proteins in

the lysosomal membrane (barriocanal et al., 1986; kundra and kornfeld, 1999). in
addition, both lamps have o-linked carbohydrates in the ‘‘hinge’’ region of the
luminal domain (carlsson et al., 1993). lamp-1 and lamp-2 are estimated to con-
tribute to about 50% of all proteins of the lysosomal membrane (hunziker et al.,
1996). the presence of lamp molecules is one of the major deﬁnitions of the lyso-
somal compartment (kornfeld and mellman, 1989). both lamps were originally
thought to protect the lysosomal membrane against the action of the hydrolytic
enzymes.
lamp-2 undergoes alternative splicing which leads to the isoforms lamp-2a, b,
and c (reviewed in eskelinen et al., 2005). interestingly, the expression of lamp-2
shows a tissue-speciﬁc pattern (konecki et al., 1995). the diﬀerent lamp-2 splice
variants also show tissue speciﬁc expression (konecki et al., 1995; lichter-konecki
et al., 1999). in humans, mutations in the gene encoding lamp-2 are the cause of
danon disease, a fatal cardiomyopathy and myopathy associated with mental retar-
dation. the disease is characterized by the accumulation of late autophagic vacuoles
in the heart and skeletal muscle (nishino, 2003; nishino et al., 2000). most of the
detected mutations lead to complete of nearly complete absence of lamp-2 protein
in tissue. a mutation aﬀecting the lamp-2b isoform only causes full danon syn-
drome (nishino et al., 2000). in agreement with this, lamp-2b is the principal iso-
form in skeletal muscle (konecki et al., 1995).
2. consequences of lamp deletion in mice
to address the speciﬁc functions of lamp-1 and lamp-2, we generated mice
deﬁcient in each of these proteins. lamp-1 deﬁcient mice were viable and fertile.
apart from a mild regional astrogliosis and altered immunoreactivity against anti-
cathepsin d in the brain, all tissues of these mice were normal (andrejewski et al.,
1999). although lamp-1 is an abundant protein component of the lysosomal mem-
brane, lysosomal properties including enzyme activities, ph, osmotic stability, den-
sity, morphology, subcellular distribution, and lysosomal enzyme processing were
similar to controls in lamp-1 deﬁcient cells. an upregulation of lamp-2 protein
was observed in kidney, spleen and heart of lamp-1 deﬁcient mice, while the levels
of another lysosomal membrane protein, limp-2, were unaﬀected. this upregula-
tion was also evident in tissues lacking only one lamp-1 allele, which suggests com-
pensation of lamp-1 deﬁciency by lamp-2 upregulation.
in contrast to the relatively mild phenotype in lamp-1 knockout mice, deﬁciency
of lamp-2 caused a severe phenotype. fifty percent of the mice died at the age of
20–40 days (tanaka et al., 2000). electron microscopy revealed a massive accumu-
lation of autophagic vacuoles in several tissues including liver, pancreas, spleen, kid-
ney, skeletal muscle, heart, capillary endothelium, intestinal wall, lymph nodes, and
neutrophilic leukocytes. both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells showed an accumula-
tion of large autophagic vacuoles. interestingly, autophagic vacuoles containing sin-
gle mitochondria were abundant
in cardiomyocytes (stypmann et al., 2006),
suggesting mitochondria are frequently degraded by autophagy in this tissue. the
498

relative and absolute size of the heart was increased in the lamp-2 knockout ani-
mals (stypmann et al., 2006). in spite of this, the force developed by the heart was
clearly weaker than in the control mice (tanaka et al., 2000). these ﬁndings are in
agreement with the fact that cardiomyopathy is frequently observed in danon dis-
ease patients (nishino et al., 2000).
in lamp-2 deﬁcient hepatocytes we showed that retarded consumption, rather
than increased formation, of autophagic vacuoles was the cause for their accumula-
tion. this was experimentally tested by measuring degradation of long-lived pro-
teins, which mainly occurs via autophagy, and by quantitative
electron
microscopy (eskelinen et al., 2002; tanaka et al., 2000).
3. lamp-1 and lamp-2 double deﬁcient phenotype
we also generated mice double deﬁcient in lamp-1 and lamp-2 (eskelinen
et al., 2004). lamp-1/lamp-2 double deﬁcient mouse embryos exhibited a variable
macroscopic phenotype, ranging from virtually normal to a complex pattern of pre-
dominantly craniofacial abnormalities. the general microscopic appearance of the
organs was essentially similar in controls and double knockouts. on the cellular
level, however, double-knockouts showed a much higher frequency of cytoplasmic
vacuoles, which could often be identiﬁed as autophagic vacuoles. these vacuoles
were most regularly seen in vascular endothelium and schwann cells; furthermore
they occurred in the neuroepithelium and occasionally in hepatocytes, whereas they
were not detected in the myocardium. the double deﬁcient mice died between
embryonic days 14.5 and 16.5.
we also checked whether the autophagic accumulation observed in situ is also
preserved in ﬁbroblast cells derived from lamp-double deﬁcient embryos. quanti-
tative electron microscopy revealed that after 2 h of starvation in serum and amino
acid free medium, about 2.5 times more autophagic vacuoles accumulated in the
double deﬁcient cell lines when compared to control cell lines or single deﬁcient cell
lines (figs. 1 and 2) (eskelinen et al., 2004). also without starvation the number of
autophagic vacuoles was higher in the double deﬁcient cells as compared to lamp-2
single knockout and control cells (fig. 2). in the double deﬁcient cells the amount of
early autophagic vacuoles was comparable to control cells, but the amount of late
vacuoles, containing partially degraded cytoplasmic material and also a ﬂuid-phase
endocytic marker, was increased. this suggests that although initial maturation of
autophagosomes including fusion with endosomes is functional, the ﬁnal maturation
step of the late autophagic vacuoles, probably including fusion with lysosomes, is
retarded. in agreement with this proposition, we showed that recruitment of the
small gtpase rab7 to autophagosomes was retarded in lamp double deﬁcient
cells (ja¨ger et al., 2004). rab7 is needed for autolysosome formations (gutierrez
et al., 2004; ja¨ger et al., 2004). further, we showed that fusion of late endosomes/
lysosomes with autophagosomes was reduced in lamp double deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts
and hela cells depleted of lamp-2 or both lamp-1 and lamp-2 using rna
interference (gonzales-polo et al., 2005).

incubated in serum and amino acid free medium for 2 h. numerous early/initial autophagic vacuoles (avi)
and late/degradative autophagic vacuoles (avd) are seen in the cytoplasm. avi contain morphologically
intact, and avd partially degraded, cytoplasmic material.

deﬁcient (la1/la2 / ), lamp-2 single deﬁcient (la2-/-), and wild type (mef+/+) mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts were ﬁxed without treatment (fcs), or incubated in serum and amino acid free medium for 2 h
(ebs 2 h). the cells were prepared for electron microscopy and the volume fraction of early and late
autophagic vacuoles (avi and avd) was estimated by point counting.

to clarify the eﬀect of lamps on total protein degradation, we analysed the deg-
radation of long lived proteins in starved and non starved mefs (eskelinen et al.,
2004). surprisingly, lamp deﬁciencies did not aﬀect the overall rates of protein deg-
radation. lysosomal enzyme activities were also unaltered in lamp-single and dou-
ble deﬁcient mefs. acidiﬁcation of the lysosomal compartments appeared also
normal as judged by vital staining with the acidotropic drug, lysotracker red.
the rate of 3-methyladenine sensitive protein degradation in amino acid starved
cells, which represent autophagic degradation, was also unaltered in the lamp dou-
ble deﬁcient cells. this is surprising, taking into account the reduced fusion of auto-
phagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes in the double knockout cells (see
above). microautophagy is not dependent on autophagosome–lysosome fusion (esk-
elinen, 2005). it is possible that in lamp double deﬁcient cells microautophagy is
activated and compensates for the loss of protein degradation due to reduced lyso-
some fusion. on the other hand, it is possible that in lamp double deﬁcient cells the
increased amount of
late, degradative autophagic vacuoles compensates for
decreased protein degradation per vacuole. the autophagosomes in the double
knockout cells are still able to fuse with endosomes, which probably deliver some
hydrolytic enzymes (eskelinen et al., 2004).
filipin staining (fig. 3) and a biochemical cholesterol assay revealed that uneste-
riﬁed cholesterol accumulated in the lamp double deﬁcient cells (eskelinen et al.,
2004). the ﬁlipin-stained vesicles in double deﬁcient cells showed a partial colocal-
isation with the late endosomal marker lysobisphosphatidic acid (lbpa), rab7,

and npc1, as well as with cathepsin d and limp-2/lgp-85, indicating that choles-
terol accumulated in endo/lysosomal compartments. the connection of lamp deﬁ-
ciency and cholesterol accumulation is currently under investigation.
4. conclusions
in conclusion, the viability of mice deﬁcient in either lamp-1 or lamp-2, as
well as the embryonic lethal phenotype of lamp-1/lamp-2 double deﬁcient mice
proves that these two major lysosomal membrane proteins share common functions
in vivo. however, since lamp-2 single deﬁciency has more severe consequences
including accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in heart and skeletal muscle,
lamp-2 seems to have more speciﬁc functions than lamp-1. the phenotype of
the lamp-2 deﬁcient mice and the symptoms of danon disease patients suggest that
autophagic degradation has an important role in the physiology of heart and skeletal
muscle cells, most likely in the turnover of mitochondria. in embryonic ﬁbroblasts,
mutual disruption of both lamps is associated with an increased accumulation of
autophagic vacuoles, altered lysosomal appearance, and disturbed cholesterol
metabolism, while protein degradation rates are not aﬀected. these results clearly
show that the lamp proteins fulﬁl functions far beyond the initially suggested roles
in maintaining the structural integrity of the lysosomal membranes.
