indictate 
structural analyses have shown that the bind-
ing of p53 and mdm2 to hausp was mutually 
exclusive12,13, although both proteins are rec-
ognized by the same domain within hausp. 
whether  foxo  proteins  also  bind  hausp 
in the same region and contain the consen-
sus  hausp  binding  motif  present  in  other 
interacting partners of hausp has yet to be 
determined. it is also possible that the uniden-
tified e3 ligase for foxo monoubiquitination 
may be a substrate for hausp deubiquitina-
tion, which would parallel hausp-dependent 
regulation of p53 stability through preferential 
deubiquitination  and  stabilization  of  the  e3 
ligase mdm2 (fig. 1b).
another  major  question  left  unanswered 
by  this  study  is  how  monoubiquitination  of 
foxo targets the protein to the nucleus? it 
is likely that the monoubiquitinated form of 
foxo can interact with protein partners in 
the nucleus that function as ubiquitin recep-
tors. alternatively, monoubiquitinated foxo 
may allow its association with a nucleo–cyto-
plasmic shuttling protein or receptor that can 
bring foxo to the nucleus. this would enable 
the selective entrapment of monoubiquitinated 
foxo to activate gene transcription. although 
modification by the small ubiquitin-like modi-
fier sumo is known to target substrates to the 
nucleus, it is not a general feature for ubiquiti-
nated proteins to confer a targeting advantage 
for the nuclear compartment.
protein modifications, such as phosphoryla-
tion, acetylation and monoubiquitination are 
reversible cellular processes. ubiquitin modi-
fying  enzymes  and  dubs  counteract  each 
other in much the same way that kinases are 
antagonized by phosphatases and acetylases 
are antagonized by deacetylases. the emerg-
ing  theme  in  signal  transduction  pathways 
is  that  many  positive  regulators  will  often 
closely associate with their negative regula-
tors in a spatial and temporal manner. this 
enables rapid and reversible changes in their 
signalling output. consistent with this theme, 
recent  studies  have  shown  that  monoubiq-
uitination  in  dna  repair  pathways  is  often 
antagonized by specific dubs6. this has been 
demonstrated in the fanconi anaemia dna 
repair and the pcna-dependent translesion 
synthesis  pathways14,15.  the  study  by  van 
der horst et al.5 explores another interesting 
nuclear pathway where monoubiquitination 
and deubiquitination are critical regulators of 
cell-fate decisions.

atg5: more than an autophagy factor
patrice codogno1,3 and alfred j. meijer2
atg5 has been previously characterized as a protein specifically required for autophagy, a lysosomal catabolic pathway for proteins 
and organelles. however, it has now been shown that, in addition to its role in the formation of autophagosomes, an atg5 fragment 
produced by calpain cleavage has pro-apoptotic properties.
macroautophagy  (hereafter  referred  to  as 
autophagy)  is  an  evolutionarily  conserved 
process for lysosomal recycling of cytoplasmic 
material1. depending on the cellular context, 
autophagy  can  promote  cell  survival  or  cell 
death. atg proteins are required for the forma-
tion of the autophagosome, the initial vacuole 
that sequesters cytoplasmic material before its 
delivery to the lysosome. sixteen atg proteins 
function in a hierarchical manner during the 
different stages of autophagosome biogenesis. 
atg5,  first  discovered  in  yeast,  is  a  protein 
involved in the early stages of autophagosome

formation2 (fig. 1). on page 1124 of this issue, 
yousefi et al.3 report that, independent of its 
function  in  autophagy,  atg5  is  a  pro-apop-
totic molecule targeted to mitochondria after 
being cleaved by calpain, a calcium depend-
ent protease (fig. 1). yousefi et al.3, have thus 
uncovered a novel calpain substrate, a novel 
posttranslational modification of atg5 and a 
hitherto unknown link between the molecular 
machinery of autophagy and apoptosis.
two ubiquitin-like modification systems are 
involved in the formation of autophagosomes. 
during attachmentof atg12 to atg5, the car-
boxy-terminal glycine of atg12 forms an iso-
peptide bond with the ε-amino group of a lysine 
residue in atg5 (ref. 2). this linkage is required 
for the atg8 (also known as lc3) modification 
to the polar head of phosphatidylethanolamine, 
a  component  of  the  phospholipid  bilayer, 
to occur4. both modification systems depend 
on the activity of other atg proteins, which have 
a similar role to that of the e1 and e2 enzymes 
in the ubiquitination cascade. the formation 
of the atg12 modified atg5 is constitutive and 
occurs soon after the individual proteins have 
been synthesized.
previous  work  inactivating  atg5  in  mice 
provided elegant evidence in support of the 
cytoprotective role of basal autophagy during 
brain  degeneration5,6.  furthermore,  inhibit-
ing starvation-stimulated autophagy by atg5 
knockdown has also been shown to make cells 
more sensitive to apoptosis7. yousefi et al.3 have 
now shown that atg5 overexpression sensitizes 
tumour cells to various apoptotic stimuli. they 
also demonstrate the death-promoting activity 
of atg5 in vivo after implantation of breast can-
cer cells expressing increased levels of atg5 in

figure 1 partners of atg5 and their role in autophagy and apoptosis. the ubiquitin-like attachment of 
atg12 and atg5 requires the activity of atg7 and atg10 which function in a similar manner to e1 and e2 
enzymes in the ubiquitin system. the lysine residue at position 130 in atg5 forms an isopeptide bond 
with the c-terminal glycine residue in atg12. together with other atg proteins, atg5–atg12 contributes 
to the formation of the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic material before lysosomal delivery. 
autophagy in the basal state, or after stimulation by nutrient starvation, is a survival and cytoprotective 
process. in certain settings, for example in response to death inducers, autophagosomes are part of the 
autophagic cell death process. in response to interferon-γ (ifn-γ), atg5–atg12, through atg5, interacts 
with fadd to trigger autophagic cell death. atg5 is also a substrate for calpains. the truncated form 
of atg5 generated by calpain-dependent cleavage at position thr 193 is a pro-apoptotic molecule 
that translocates to mitochondria. the pro-apoptotic activity of the truncated form of atg5 could be 
attributable to bcl-xl inactivation as result of binding.
immunodeficient nude mice; tumour growth 
was reduced and a high frequency of apoptosis 
and/or necrosis cells were observed3.
various data indicate a potential intercon-
nection  between  autophagy  and  apoptosis8. 
common regulators of both pathways can con-
trol the level of autophagy to keep it in a range 
compatible with cell survival, as recently dem-
onstrated for the interaction between bcl-2 and 
the autophagy protein beclin 1 (ref. 9). several 
studies have also previously hinted at the pos-
sible  involvement  of  atg5  in  the  crosstalk 
between autophagy and cell death. for exam-
ple, the interaction between atg5 and fadd 
(fas-associated protein with death domain, a 
mediator of death receptor-dependent apop-
tosis) has been shown to have a crucial role in 
interferon-γ induced cell death10 (fig. 1). pyo 
et al.10 have shown that the attachment of atg12 
to atg5, and very probably the involvement of 
the  atg12-modified  atg5  in  autophagy,  are 
required to trigger cell death. in another study, 
shimizu et al.11 showed that, in cells depleted 
of  bax–bak  proteins  (the  core  executors  of 
apoptosis) knockdown of atg5 by small inter-
ference rna (sirna) inhibits autophagy and 
the autophagic cell death pathway triggered in 
response to apoptotic inducers.
interestingly,  yousefi  et  al.3  have  now 
identified a fragment of atg5 with a relative 
molecular mass of 24,000 (mr 24k) in human 
neutrophils cultured in the absence of sur-
vival factors. this fragment is produced from 
the full-length 33k atg5. the appearance of 
this short fragment has also been observed in 
various cell lines exposed to apoptotic stim-
uli. sequence analysis and proteolytic assays 
have shown that the generated fragment cor-
responds to the amino-terminal part of atg5, 
cleaved from the full-length protein by cal-
cium-dependent proteases calpain 1 and 2. 
calpain inhibition by pharmacological agents 
or knockdown via rna interference (rnai) 
blocked  atg5  cleavage  in  cells  undergoing 
apoptosis. atg5 can thus be added to the list 
of calpain substrates that included apoptotic 
effectors such as members of the bcl-2 fam-
ily, aif and p53 (ref. 12). one characteristic 
of atg5 is that this protein is barely detect-
able in its free state. in fact, atg5 and atg12 
mostly exist in an attached form and so far 
no demodifying enzyme has been described 
for this system. moreover, cleavage mediated 
by  the  calcium-dependent  calpains  1  and 
2  occurs  at  position  thr 193,  and  lys 130 
is  engaged  in  the  attachment  with  atg12. 
this  would  suggest  that  calpain  cleavage 
occurs  soon  after  atg5  synthesis,  a  point 
deserving further investigation.
yousefi et al.3 have also investigated if the 
short  atg5  fragment  produced  by  calpain 
cleavage regulates apoptosis. they found that 
enforced expression of the truncated form of 
atg5 induces hallmarks of apoptosis. a high 
level of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein pro-
tects  cells  from  the  death-inducing  activity 
of the truncated form of atg5, but it does not 
affect the cleavage of endogenous atg5. this 
suggests that the cleavage occurs in a pro-apop-
totic pathway upstream of bcl-2 activation and 
precedes the involvement of the mitochondria 
in  apoptosis.  in  fact,  the  truncated  form  of 
atg5,  in  contrast  with  the  full-length  atg5, 
was translocated to the mitochondria, indicat-
ing that cleavage is an early apoptotic event. 
in apoptotic cells, the truncated form of atg5 
associates with bcl-xl, which normally inacti-
vates the pro-apoptotic protein bax. it remains 
to be shown whether the truncated form of 
atg5 inactivates bcl-xl and thus leads to the 
bax activation. a previous study has shown 
that the expression of a form of atg5 truncated 
at residue 170 did not induce cell death10. as 
the atg5 (1–193) reported here3 induces cell 
death, it can be surmised that the atg5 region 
spanning from residue 170–193 is responsible 
for the apoptotic potential of the atg5 fragment 
generated by calpain cleavage.
the death-inducing activity of the truncated 
form of atg5 (1–193) is observed in the absence 
of autophagy, suggesting that either this form 
cannot be a substrate for the attachment with 
atg12 or alternatively, that the modified form 
is not active in autophagy. in previous work10, 
atg5 overexpression in hela cells was shown to 
stimulate autophagy and cell death. however, 
expression of a mutant atg5k130r, which could 
not be modified by atg12, did not stimulate 
autophagy and increased death was observed10. 
further studies are required to find out whether 
this mutant is able to generate the pro-apop-
totic, truncated fragment of atg5.
yousefi  et  al.3  have  identified  a  hitherto 
unknown  crosstalk  between  the  autophagic 
machinery and apoptosis which is mediated 
through  a  calpain-dependent  cleavage  of 
atg5 and that is independent of its function 
in autophagy. how atg5 cleavage is regulated 
remains  to  be  elucidated,  as  does  its  poten-
tial involvement in the control of autophagy. 
it  seems  unlikely  that  the  calpain-mediated 
cleavage of atg5 is a mechanism for limiting

the induction of cytoprotective autophagy in 
response to apoptotic stimuli, because only a 
small fraction of atg5 is required for formation 
of the autophagosome to occur13.
these new findings are conceptually impor-
tant as they demonstrate that atg-dependent 
cell  death  is  not  necessarily  associated  with 
autophagosome formation. it will be interest-
ing to determine whether the function of atg 
proteins (other than atg12 and atg8 ubiquitin-
like attachment systems) can also be modulated 
by posttranslational modifications.

how wandering cells 
make a perfect eye
formation of the vertebrate optical lobe is a model system for studying 
organogenesis. the cellular mechanisms leading to the emergence of 
the optical lobe are unknown. rembold et al. have now shown that 
migration of single retinal progenitors is essential for growth of the 
optical lobes (science 313, 1130–1134; 2006).
to follow retinal progenitors at the time of neural tube formation, 
rembold et al. used medaka fish embryos expressing a fluorescently 
tagged version of the retinal-specific transcription factor rx3. they 
observed that the most medially and ventrally localized retinal pro-
genitors only exhibit short range movements, thus defining a wide 
domain at the site of future eye emergence. however, neural cells and 
laterally localized retinal progenitors converge more actively to the 
middle of the embryo. once there, the neuronal progenitors elongate 
the neural tube, whereas the lateral retinal cells join the most stable 
retinal progenitors population. all retinal cells then move outwards 
to form one optical lobe on each side of the future head. by visual-
izing the membranes of the migrating retinal cells in the embryo, the 
researchers found that similarly to single migrating cells, lamellipodia 
and filopodia form at their front and they are also able to move over 
their neighbours.
to understand whether this behaviour was biologically important, 
the researchers examined rx3 mutants, which lack eyes despite hav-
ing retinal progenitors. in rx3 mutant embryos, all retinal progenitors 
behave like neural cells, such that they only move towards the mid-
dle of the embryo and are integrated in the neural tube, leading to 
during eye formation, evaginating rx3 positive cells (green) define a wide 
domain and then emerge on each side of the embryo (nuclei; red).
eyeless animals. thus, both the movements of retinal progenitors to 
form a wide domain, as well as their migration outwards from the 
neural ridge, are necessary for optical lobe formation. when wild-type 
retinal progenitors are transplanted in an  rx3 eyeless mutant embryo, 
they have the same migratory properties as those of a wild-type animal 
and are able to form an optical lobe. rx3 expression is therefore neces-
sary and sufficient to specify the migratory characteristics of the retinal 
progenitors and the directional cues for migration are still intact in an  
rx3 mutant embryo.
although demonstrating that cell autonomous migration of retinal 
progenitors is essential for eye formation, these findings also raise new 
questions. for example, why do medial and lateral retinal progenitors 
exhibit different patterns of movement and what causes cells to change 
direction and migratory characteristics at a given time during develop-
ment? future in vivo studies of migration dynamics during develop-
ment will be critical for resolving these intriguing problems.
