abstract
to discover the evolutionary logic of intracellular endosymbiosis, we investigated a theoretical model (simultaneous ordinary
differential equations) of a material-cycling system inside a host cell. in the model, we introduced a recently developed cell biology
concept called ‘‘autophagy’’, which is a decomposing–recycle process of self-compiled materials found universally among eukaryote cells.
our model is based on traditional simultaneous ode for natural ecosystems that involve producing, grazing, and decomposing processes
in material cycling. in the basic intracellular metabolic system, several enzymes regulate metabolism by synthesizing and converting
metabolites into biomolecules that are precursors for enzymes involved in the producing process. symbionts are involved in grazing
processes and autophagosomes that degrade materials are involved in decomposing recycles. we compared and analyzed the local
stability of ode systems in three cases: (1) the independent, free-living cell (the basal state of a cell), (2) the case where symbionts invade
and exploit macrobiomaterials as parasites inside a host cell, and (3) the combination where symbionts assist the host’s metabolism. we
conclude that: (i) as consumers, symbionts are required to have a growth rate that is higher than the rate of autophagosome
decomposition, (ii) the host cell with a biomass larger than the threshold size would realize the mutualistic relationship with its symbiont,
and (iii) this partnership accelerates the biomaterial turnover ﬂow on the basis of biomaterials.

is
universally recognized in nature (buchner, 1965). in the
evolution of endosymbiosis, a new mutualistic system
emerges from phylogenetically distinct organisms, often
generating wide adaptive radiation. endosymbiosis is
considered one of
the major transitions in evolution
(margulis, 1981; maynard-smith and szathma´ ry, 1995).
the emergence of integrated organisms has been investi-
gated as the ‘‘hypercycle’’ of prebiotic evolution, in which
each of the subunits can provide some adaptive beneﬁt to
its partner (eigen and schuster, 1979). however, because

genetically unrelated organisms rarely start a mutualistic
relationship but usually end up in parasitism (an exploi-
ter–exploitee relationship) (axelrod, 1984; nowak and
sigmund, 1992, 1993), the evolution of cooperation should
be viewed as having greater cooperative trait value than a
threshold that provides something advantageous to its
partner (frank, 1995).
from an evolutionarily ecological point of view,
mutualism is expected to originate from parasitism at the
beginning. two important factors have been targeted here:
decrease in virulence and vertical transmission. as long as
the host and the parasite coexist in a long-term relation-
ship, parasites should evolve to decrease the level of
exploitation and virulence on their host because too
much exploitation and virulence would lead to extinction
of the host and, consequently, the parasite itself. for
example, myxoma virus induced artiﬁcially into the rabbit

population in australia was highly lethal at ﬁrst, but the
virus evolved rapidly to lessen its virulence within a couple
of decades, and the host and its parasites ﬁnally established
coexistence without
extinction (fenner, 1965, 1983;
maynard-smith, 1989). levin and pimentel (1981) and
may and anderson (1983) analyzed the rabbit—myxoma
coexistence theoretically.
ewald (1987) compared transmission modes of parasites
between horizontal and vertical and concluded that the
ﬁtness of parasites with vertical transmission should be
reﬂected directly by the host’s ﬁtness and that such
parasites are likely to exhibit low virulence. herre (1993)
showed that nematode parasites exhibit low virulence in a
ﬁg wasp species which has nearly vertical transmission.
based on the early ess model for the evolutionary shift
from parasitism to mutualism (roughgarden, 1975),
matsuda and shimada (1993) and yamamura (1993,
1996) showed that parasites could shift their transmission
mode from horizontal to vertical. these models suggest
that a mutualistic relationship can be selected for if the
symbionts and their host can make use of metabolic wastes
exerted by their partner (nonzero-sum game).
however, these ess models were constructed to max-
imize particular strategic parameters reﬂecting the ﬁtness
(survivorship or reproduction), and none of the models
considered metabolism as a whole within a cell. we took a
novel approach by formulating a mathematical model that
introduces the recently developed cell biology concept of
‘‘autophagy’’ (levine and klionsky, 2004; lum et al., 2005;
mizushima, 2005). almost all eukaryotic cells use the
decomposing process of autophagy in intracellular meta-
bolism, by which a cell recycles and renews the materials of
its own organelles. the outline of this process is as follows.
first, an autophagosome, a vesicle surrounded by a lipid
membrane, is formed in the cytoplasm to enclose organelles
or other structures or molecules. next, the autophagosome
fuses with the lysosome. finally, the components in the
cytoplasm are decomposed together with the autophago-
some inside the lysosome (yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005).
empirical research also shows that the autophagic machin-
ery can act as an innate defense system against invading
pathogens (nakagawa et al., 2004; deretic, 2005; schmid
et al., 2005; seay et al., 2006). ogawa et al. (2005) found that
an invader that can escape from autophagy can succeed as
a parasite. it appears plausible that symbionts were, at the
beginning of endosymbiosis, microbial invaders of their
host cell and were able to be degraded by autophagy.
we incorporated the process of autophagic decomposing
into the model of endosymbiosis by referring to and
drawing on the idea of ecosystem ecology. in nature, the
material cycle in the ecosystem is described on terms of the
roles of the producer, the consumer, and the decomposer
(margalef, 1963; odum, 1971, 1983; ulanowicz, 1983). in
natural ecosystems, plants that assimilate carbon and
inorganic minerals using photoenergy act as the producer,
animals grazing on plants act as the consumer, and fungi or
bacteria reducing dead organic matter to nutrient minerals
act as the decomposer. lotka (1922) suggested that natural
selection should tend to make the energy ﬂow through the
ecosystem a maximum; loreau (1995) analyzed the impact
of adding the consumer and concluded that consumption
itself reinforces the turnover rate of material cycling when
its consumption is moderate.
similarly,
the cell’s metabolic system, consisting of
biomaterial substances and enzymes, plays a self-production
role in an autocatalytic way. symbionts exploiting metabo-
lites from a host cell are recognized as the consumer. various
cellular components, including the host cell’s enzymes and
symbionts, are decomposed by the autophagic process, which
operates as the decomposer structurally or as the predator–
recycler functionally (andersen, 1997).
in this paper, we analyze the simultaneous ordinary
differential equations (ode) based on material cycling in
the ‘‘cytological ecosystem’’, and we attempt to answer the
following questions. first, what is the theoretical condition
under which symbionts can exist in the host cell? second,
what determines the bifurcation between parasitism and
mutualism? finally, are there any common characteristics
between endosymbiosis and ecosystem development?
2. model and analysis
2.1. a free-living cell with no invader [case 1]
because a cell consists of a huge number of organic
components and metabolic processes,
it is difﬁcult to
describe all the elements and reactions in the metabolic
pathways. we focus on low molecular weight organic
substances in a cell, such as amino acids and sugars, to
construct a simple scheme of metabolism, as illustrated in
fig. 1. this cell-metabolism model maintains metabolites
n 1 and biomaterials n 2 by enzymes
that are
synthesized from biomaterials n 2 themselves. metabolites
ðn 1þ correspond to metabolic intermediate substances to be
transformed into other chemicals such as pyruvic acid or
glucose-6-phosphate, which are used to produce amino
acids or nucleotides. the model also includes biomaterials
ðn 2þ existing as monomers, such as amino acids or
nucleotides, which are used to synthesize functional
polymers such as proteins or transfer rnas.
(e)
for simplicity, we assume that catalytic reactions by
enzymes take the ﬁrst-order, linear interaction terms in this
simultaneous ode system. because we are not interested
in the quantitative behavior of the components in the
system, the interactions are adopted as simply as possible,
although we could set nonlinear forms as michaelis–men-
ten reactions. as shown in fig. 1, enzymes catalyze to
produce n 2 from n 1 with efﬁciency a1 and a2 for the
reverse reaction. enzymes (e) are decomposed by autop-
hagy at a constant rate d 1. autophagosomes (a) are also
assumed to be synthesized from biomaterials n 2 and to be
destroyed by d 2. in reality, the synthesis of both e and a
should be under genetic control, but we assume simply that
they are made from n 2 at constant rates b1 and b2,

to analyze the impact of endosymbiogenesis, we ﬁrst
consider the situation where the symbiont is absent. when
this cell is closed (e  h  0 in fig. 1), all components in
the host cell in model eqs. (1)–(4) reach the following
steady state (superscripted by an asterisk):

which are made from n 2 at constant rates b1 and b2, respectively.
metabolites and biomaterials are transformed bilaterally by the catalytic

decomposed by autophagy with a rate d 1, and their elements return to

respectively. the cell obtains the resource (r) from the
surrounding environment outside the cell and converts it to
metabolites n 1 with e and uses biomaterials n 2 at a rate h
for growth of the cell itself.
we have assumed that the timescale is much shorter for
the metabolic equilibrium state than for cell growth, and it
gives coefﬁcients e and h, which are much smaller than
other reaction parameters. we focus on the maintenance of
the cell metabolic system, which is presumed closed
ðe  h  0þ.
although the metabolic regulation is maintained by
different enzymes in different pathways for each direction,
we have combined these as one pathway to simplify the cell
system, as depicted in fig. 1.

the steady state can be analyzed by the local stability
condition by seeking the eigenvalue ð8reðlþo0þ of the
characteristic equation and shows the stability for this
metabolic system (see appendix a). this means that the
metabolic system maintains homeostasis in the sense that
the system returns to its steady state after perturbation
caused by the variability of abiotic (e.g., temperature, etc.)
and biotic (e.g., food resource) factors in the host cell.
2.2. with invaders (symbionts)
in this section, we address the essential issue that the
host cell holds symbionts inside it. we call the symbionts
within the host cell ‘‘invaders’’ regardless of the relation-
ship they construct. the model is shown in fig. 2 and is

the invaders (p) exploit metabolites n 1 or biomaterials
n 2, or both, as the resource from the host cell with an

case 1, we did not set nonlinear interactions for the
functional response, and the ﬁrst-order linear interactions
are supposed simply as follows:
f iðn i; pþ ¼ r  n i  p.
(12)
invaders exploit several types of molecules from their host
cell according to their needs. instinctively, the invaders act
parasitically for the ﬁrst time because they exploit resources
from their host cell as a necessity for survival instead of
feeding by themselves. autophagy works to defend against
invaders by decomposing them at a constant rate d 3, and the
components from invaders that are decomposed return to its
host cell as biomaterials n 2.
in our model, we assume that the invaders exploit either
metabolites n 1 or biomaterials n 2 from their host cell in two
extremely simple cases. as in case 1, we also assume that the
summation of all components including the invaders is
constant, q, as the cell biomass at equilibrium as follows:
n 1 þ n 2 þ e þ a þ p ¼ q.

2.2.1. invaders without metabolic assistance (exploiting
only n 2) [case 2]
first, let us consider case 2 where invaders exploit only
biomaterials n 2. in a mathematical sense, the interaction

because all components are the same as in case 1, the
invader cannot have a positive p, but this value is 0 and is
excluded from this system. with respect to these solutions

the stability given in appendix b is
implemented by the following inequation:
(14)–(18),
d 3

(19)
the left side of inequation (19), the invader growth rate
(r) divided by its mortality rate (d 3), indicates the relative
increase in the rate of the invader. the right side gives the
relative synthesis rate of autophagosomes in the same
sense. hence, the boundary stability (p ¼ 0) is attained
when the growth rate of the invader is lower than the
synthesis
rate of autophagosomes. we checked the
dynamics numerically to determine when the invader can
thrive faster than the host defense against it. as shown in
fig. 3(a), the host cell will no longer survive because it
lacks n 2 absorbed by the invader. we have conﬁrmed the
existence of this dead stationary state, that is, the set of
solutions
illu-
strated in fig. 3(a). we also checked the local stability of
this state. thus, the host cell could not keep the invaders
stably in this metabolic system, and the relationship
between the host and the invaders is regarded as parasitic
or pathogenic.

3. discussion
3.1. the condition for coexistence
we demonstrated mathematically the conditions deter-
mining whether invaders can coexist within their host cell.
invaders that do not assist their host through exploiting n 1
metabolically cannot establish a stable coexistence in
equilibrium. such invaders will either be excluded by their
host’s autophagy or burst out of the host cell as parasites
or pathogens. in the former, the host cell can digest the
invaders if the synthesis rate of autophagosomes is greater
than the invader’s growth rate. otherwise, invaders persist
inside the host cell if their metabolic performance is better
than the host’s or if their growth rate is high enough to
escape from autophagy.
fig. 4. material cycling ﬂow (j) and the compartment sizes in equilibrium
as a function of the growth rate of the symbiont, r, when the symbiont
assists its host with effective metabolic advantage. (a) the total biomass is
larger than the threshold, and the host–symbiont relation should be
mutualistic. (b) the total biomass is smaller, and the relation can still be
parasitic. parameter values: a1 ¼ a2 ¼ b1 ¼ b2 ¼ d 1 ¼ d 2 ¼ d 3 ¼ 1:0, the
0 ¼ 4:0 in both cases; total biomass q ¼ 10:0 in (a), and
threshold value q
q ¼ 2:5 in (b).
whereas for qoq
(fig. 4(b)), j decreases. because the
value q can correspond to the total amount of host cell
components (is equal to the total host cell size), we
conclude that evolution to either parasitism or mutualism
depends on the host cell size. metabolites n 2 follow the
same two distinct patterns as j with increasing r.
these tendencies are proved by their partial derivatives

for example, at
the evolutionary beginning of
the
eukaryotic cell a couple of billion years ago, ancestors of
the mitochondrion were likely to have had a higher atp
productivity than the ancestral pre-eukaryotic host cells
(andersson et al., 2003; john and whatley, 1975). in the
case of the insect, the beneﬁt to the host insect through its
symbiotic bacteria originates from the bacterial product
(ishikawa, 1985; bourtzis and miller, 2006), which the host
cannot synthesize by itself. this situation corresponds to
the low performance of catalytic activity for n 1 to n 2
reaction by enzymes or the lack of enzymes in the host cell
in our model, where it is easier to establish a symbiotic
relationship between the host and its invader because the
threshold, q
, is quite low. in other words, this resembles a
process of complete niche differentiation between the
enzymes and the invader.
our assumption that the invader exploits either n 1 or n 2
from the host is extremely simple and may be far from the
reality of nature. however, the metabolic assistance from
the invader to its host cell should be indispensable for
generating the mutualistic symbiosis relationship regardless
of how the invader exploits particular substances from its
host. from the ecological perspective,
the coexistence
cannot be maintained and the competitive exclusion should
occur without differentiating the invader from the autop-
hagosome and its niche.

3.2. evolution to parasitism or mutualism?
once the invader enters the host cell and a new
combination of metabolic cycles starts, one may ask
whether the new metabolic system is advantageous. as
illustrated in fig. 4, the invader numbers (p) increase by
increasing the growth rate (r) monotonically, and the
metabolite n 1 decreases because of exploitation of n 1 by
the invaders as the resource, and vice versa. the transition
into biomaterials (n 2) depends on the host biomass q,
which corresponds to the host cell size. when the host cell
has a large biomass ðq4q
0þ, n 2 increases with increasing
r. in the case with a large cell biomass, the host cell can
suppress its symbionts adequately and return to n 2
efﬁciently, and this results in abundant production of n 2.
thus, endosymbiosis promotes mutualistic evolution to
produce a combination that beneﬁts the organism.
viewed from a different angle, the resilience of this
metabolism should strengthen in sync with the enhance-
ment of the material ﬂow along with an increase in r. it is
plausible that the host cells cannot feed their resource
constantly under a changing environment. in such a
situation,
the metabolic system which is disordered
seriously depending upon the surrounding is not survive,
hence the cell must adjust its own state quickly. therefore,
it is conceivable that the enhancement of the material ﬂow
inside the cell, which increases the resilience, is advanta-
geous for the cell. in the natural ecosystem, resilience is an
important concept because of its stability against environ-
mental perturbation (pimm, 1991); the relation between the
resilience and the ﬂow through the system has been
discussed previously (deangelis, 1992).
is
smaller
than the threshold q
on the other hand, n 2 decreases gradually if the host cell
ðqoq
0þ.
biomass
autophagosomes may not be synthesized sufﬁciently in a
small cell, and the symbionts are not depressed severely by
the host’s autophagosomes. therefore, the decrease in n 2
delays the cell’s growth, and this delay turns to disadvan-
tage for the host cell’s ﬁtness. in other words,
the
symbionts will be ‘‘parasites’’ here.
the present study differs completely from previous
symbiosis models that have studied the dynamics of
coevolution between an infectious disease agent and its
host,
leading to the balance or the arms race between
parasite attacks and host defenses (frank, 1993; van
baalen, 1998; sasaki and godfray, 1999). in contrast,
our model is based on autophagy, the universal process of
eukaryotes in which any host can use its immune system to
defend against pathogens or parasites. our conclusions can
also be applied to an organism that does not have a highly
developed immune system such as a single-cell organism as
the host.
our model
leads to a new scenario in which the
mutualistic relationship originates from the efﬁcient meta-
bolic assistance by the symbiont but does not originate
from any decrease in exploitation, as suggested by rough-
garden (1975) and yamamura (1993). the parasites that
exploit only their host without giving any assistance to it
never participate in mutualistic symbiosis in our model. in
addition, for the emergence of mutualism, our model
requires the host to have a large cell size initially, which is
coincident with frank’s (1995) claim that a pair of
organisms can start mutualistic evolution if they have a
value of cooperative trait greater than the threshold at the
beginning.
3.3. the common properties between a metabolic system and
the ecosystem
at the ecosystem level in nature, consumers contribute
to the system when they have a growth rate greater than
some threshold, and more importantly, the material cycling
ﬂow is accelerated by adding the consumers (loreau,
1995). otsuka (2004) showed a similar pattern when the
ecosystem is complicated by adding carnivores to increase
the number of trophic levels. this tendency is recognized
widely in theoretical ecosystem models (odum, 1969;
loreau, 1998). the reason why material cycling accelerates
is that decomposers such as bacteria can decompose dead
animal bodies faster than they can decompose dead leaves.
also, loreau (1995) claimed that the total quantity of
nutrients in the ecosystem must be higher than some
threshold value when the consumer enhances the circular
ﬂow.
even though the cytological metabolic system in which
autophagosomes decompose elements in a cell
is con-
structed in a different way from the natural ecosystem, we
note that the two systems share some common character-
istics: (i) symbionts as consumers are required to have a
higher growth rate than the rate of autophagosome
decomposition, (ii) the host cell must be larger than a
certain threshold size to establish a mutualistic relationship
with its symbiont, and (iii) this partnership accelerates the
biomaterial turnover ﬂow.
the present results are based on steady-state analysis of
the systems and, as a result, we have several subjects to
address in future. first, the effects of nonlinear interactions
of the functional response must be taken into account to
focus on the evolution from parasitism to mutualism
because these strongly inﬂuence the host–parasite dynamics
(hassell, 1978). second, from an evolutionary perspective,
we should examine whether symbiont-containing cells as
‘‘mutants’’ can spread into a free-living host-cell popula-
tion. numerical simulations will provide insights into the
evolutionary population dynamics of the host–symbiont
system.

appendix a. the local stability in case 1
the local stability of the case 1 system described by
eqs. (1)–(4) can be analyzed proving that the eigenvalues of
its jacobian matrix are negative for their real parts.

therefore, we obtain the characteristic equation as follows:
2þ ¼ 0.
ðl þ a1  e
(b.2)
the local stability requires the term ðd 3  a
2þ to be
positive. assigning parameters (15) to the equilibrium
solution a
, we can easily obtain the necessary and
sufﬁcient condition for local stability (the inequation (19)).

we can reduce the rank of the jacobian matrix about the
simultaneous equations (1)–(4), because eq. (2) consists of
the linear combination of the other equations. the local
stability of the subsystem at equilibrium is then determined
by the eigenvalues of its jacobian matrix as follows:

(a.2)
þðl þ d 1  a
þðl þ d 2þ ¼ 0.
setting the eigenvalues as l’s, we derive the
then,
characteristic equation from this jacobian matrix (a.1) like
ðl þ a1  e
obviously,
the eigenvalues are negative because all
coefﬁcients are positive, and this system maintains the
steady state locally.
we can also connect the idea of stability to ﬂux intensity
ðj 1þ expressed by eq. (10). the resilience, one index of
system stability, is measured by the inverse of the dominant
eigenvalue. if we consider eq. (10), the ﬂux intensity ðj 1þ
consists of three terms, each of which includes the three
eigenvalues. therefore, we can expect a positive correlation
between the resilience of the system and the ﬂux intensity.
in addition, let us consider the case where the metabolic
system is not closed completely ðe  h40þ, but the system
keeps its total biomass over the metabolic reaction time-
scale ðe  r ¼ h  n
2þ. although we need to reformulate the
ode to include the terms ðe  rþ into eq. (1) and ð h  n
2þ
into eq. (2), the jacobian matrix is the same as (a.1), and
the analysis of the local stability obtains the same result as
that in the closed one.

and (11) can be analyzed in the same manner as in case 1.
first, let us consider the case where the invader does not
assist the host at all, that is, the solutions of this system in
(14)–(18).
we can derive the jacobian matrix of the system to
include parasites as follows:

(b.1)
appendix c. the local stability in case 3
there are two different states when the invader exploits
n 1, meaning that the solutions are expressed as either
(14)–(18) or (20)–(24). to check the local stability for each
case, we begin by deriving the jacobian matrix of the
system.

we obtain the characteristic equation as follows:
ðl þ d 1  a
ðc:2þ
ðl þ d 3  a
the characteristic equation can be reduced into three
terms; the ﬁrst and second terms show that the eigenvalues
are negative. the local stability is, therefore, determined
according whether the last term can have a negative
eigenvalue.
first,
let us consider the case when the invader can
coexist with the host. assigning the parameters to the
equilibrium solutions except for n 2, which is given as
(20)–(23),
the last quadratic equation is expressed as
follows:
 l þ b1
d 1

if the coefﬁcients are positive for the quadratic equation,
reðlþ becomes negative, and the last term in (c.3) must be
positive to assure the local stability determined by the
routh–hurwitz criteria (gantmacher, 1960). therefore,
the condition for the local stability is equivalent to meet the
inequation (25).
furthermore, we can refer to an effect of the symbiont’s
growth rate on the system’s local stability, and, in turn, on
the resilience of the metabolic system. as the growth rate r
increases, at the steady state the invader’s population ðpþ
also increases within the host cell, which should increase
the ﬂow intensity (j). considering the characteristic
equation (c.3),
the increase in r has an important
implication for the system’s resilience. the absolute value
of the solution of eq. (c.3) changes in proportion to the
754

article in press
coefﬁcient of the second term. then, as the parameter r
increases, the eigenvalue becomes the dominant one, and
the system should return to its steady state more quickly
after environmental perturbation. in other words, if the
symbionts grow faster in the host cell, the metabolic system
of the host cell results in a more resilient one.
second, we can derive the condition for boundary
stability at p ¼ 0. the quadratic equation which assigns
p ¼ 0 as the parameters given as (14)–(18) is as follows:
1þ ¼ 0.
ðl þ a1  e
(c.4)
local stability requires the term ðd 3  a
1þ to be
positive. by assigning parameters given as (15) and (16) to
the equilibrium solutions, we can easily show that the
condition for local stability is synonymous with meeting
the inequation (26).
