results
the purpose of this study was to investigate whether stent-based delivery of an inhibitor of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mtor) can selectively clear macrophages in rabbit atherosclerotic plaques.
current pharmacologic approaches to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques have only partially reduced the incidence
of acute coronary syndromes and sudden death. macrophages play a pivotal role in plaque destabilization,
whereas smooth muscle cells (smc) promote plaque stability.
stents eluting the mtor inhibitor everolimus were implanted in atherosclerotic arteries of cholesterol-fed rab-
bits. in addition, in vitro experiments using explanted atherosclerotic segments and cultured macrophages as
well as smc were performed.
stents eluting everolimus led to a marked reduction in macrophage content without altering the amount of smc
compared with polymer control stents. in vitro studies showed that everolimus treatment induced inhibition of
translation in both cultured macrophages and smc. however, cell death occurred only in macrophages and was
characterized by bulk degradation of long-lived proteins, processing of microtubule-associated protein light chain
3, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, which are all markers of autophagy. everolimus-induced autophagy was medi-
ated by mtor inhibition, because cell viability was not affected using tacrolimus, an mtor-independent everoli-
mus analog. moreover, mtor gene silencing was associated with selective induction of macrophage cell death.
autophagic macrophage cell death was conﬁrmed by transmission electron microscopy both in cultured cells
and in atherosclerotic explants.
conclusions
stent-based delivery of everolimus selectively cleared macrophages in rabbit atherosclerotic plaques by autoph-
agy, an mtor inhibition-dependent and novel mechanism to induce cell death in mammalian cells.

atherosclerotic plaque destabilization and rupture are
one of the main causal events of acute coronary syn-
dromes, including myocardial infarctions (1,2). on an-
giography, “vulnerable” rupture-prone plaques are often
not considered to be at risk, because they seem not to be
ﬂow limiting before destabilization occurs (3). macro-

plaques, play a pivotal role in the destabilization process,
whereas smooth muscle cells (smc) contribute to plaque
stability (4). as a consequence, it is generally assumed
that macrophage removal stabilizes the plaque (5). yet,
mechanisms whereby macrophages can be eliminated
from plaques without inﬂuencing other cell types, includ-
ing smc, are unknown. systemic therapy with statins
has been shown to reduce but not eliminate macrophages
from atherosclerotic plaques (6). suzuki et al. (7) re-
ported that stent-based delivery of rapamycin (sirolimus),
a potent mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) in-
hibitor, had a profound effect on inﬂammatory cell
activity and cytokine release in nonatherosclerotic por-
cine arteries. in the present
study, we investigated
whether implantation of stents eluting everolimus [40-
o-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin], a rapamycin derivative,
could selectively clear macrophages from atherosclerotic
plaques.

methods
in vivo experiments. twelve new zealand white rabbits
(merelbeke, belgium) were fed a 0.3% cholesterol-
supplemented diet for 40 weeks to induce atherosclerotic
plaques in the aorta (8). experiments were approved by the
local ethical committee. procedures were performed on
anesthetized rabbits using sterile techniques. at the index
procedure, the marginal ear vein was cannulated, and the
rabbit was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30
mg/kg intravenously). the right carotid artery was dissected
under sterile conditions and a 6f sheath was introduced.
under ﬂuoroscopy, a 0.014-inch guide wire (guidant
whisper; advanced cardiovascular systems, santa clara,
california) was positioned in the right or left iliac artery,
and a single dose of aspirin (60 mg/kg) as well as heparin
(100 iu/kg) was administered. two stainless steel stents
(guidant multi-link penta, 3.5/13 mm) coated with either
everolimus or durable polymer only were deployed (1
inﬂation at 9 atm during 15 to 20 s) in the infrarenal aorta
of each animal after randomization. stents were deployed at
a minimum distance of 1 cm from each other. all rabbits
were continued on 0.3% cholesterol-supplemented diet for 4
weeks to evaluate the response to drug-eluting stents.
the rabbits were then killed, the aortas were ﬂushed with
saline, and all sections were harvested and placed in 4%
formalin. the specimens were immersion-ﬁxed for 24 h
before processing. stented vessels underwent plastic embed-
ding (1:1 butyl methacrylate:methyl methacrylate; techno-
vit), and sections were obtained by saw-and-grinding using
standard techniques. stented segments were cut into one
midsection. nonstented segments were embedded in paraf-
ﬁn blocks for processing. all specimens were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin for histopathologic analysis. immuno-
histochemical detection of macrophages (ram-11, dilution
1/1000; dako, glostrup, denmark) and smc (monoclonal
anti–␣-smooth muscle actin, dilution 1/2000; sigma, st.
louis, missouri) were carried out by the indirect peroxidase
antibody conjugate technique (9–11). the sections were
incubated with a goat antimouse peroxidase-labeled anti-
body (jackson laboratory, bar harbor, maine) as secondary
antibody for 45 min.
analysis was performed by two experienced and blinded
operators. the percentage of the stent strut circumference
surrounded by macrophages or smc was assessed for each
single strut, using ram-11 or ␣-smc actin staining
respectively. the ram-11 positive area in the plaque was
assessed for all stented and nonstented segments.
in vitro experiments. cell culture. the murine macro-
phage cell line j774a.1 was grown in rpmi 1640 medium
(invitrogen, san diego, california) supplemented with 100
u/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, 50 ␮g/ml genta-
mycin, 20 u/ml polymyxin b, and 10% fetal bovine serum.
alternatively, peritoneal macrophages were isolated 4 days
after injection of brewer’s thioglycolate medium into the
peritoneal cavity of c56bl/6 mice as reported previously

from transfected cells using the fastlane cell cdna kit
(qiagen). taqman gene expression assays for mtor
(assay id mm00445015_m1; applied biosystems, foster

abiprism 7300 sequence detector system (applied biosys-
tems) in 25 ␮l reaction volumes containing 1⫻ universal

polymerase chain reaction (pcr) ampliﬁcation were 50°c
for 2 minutes, 95°c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 1 min. relative expression of
mrna species was calculated using the comparative thresh-

tured cells (106) were lysed in 0.5 ml hypotonic lysis buffer
supplemented with 250 ␮g proteinase k. lysates were
incubated for 1 h at 50°c, then supplemented with 5-␮l
volumes of dnase-free rnase a (2 mg/ml) and incubated
for an additional hour at 37°c. the samples were precipi-
tated overnight with 1/10 volume of 3 mol/l sodium acetate
and 1 volume of isopropanol. the dna pellets were air
dried and dissolved in te buffer (10 mmol/l tris, 1 mmol/l
edta, ph 7.4). after electrophoresis in 2% agarose, dna
laddering was visualized under uv light by staining the
agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
for western blot analyses, cultured cells were lysed in an
appropriate volume of laemmli sample buffer (bio-rad;
hercules, california). cell lysates were then heat-denatured
for 4 minutes in boiling water and loaded on a sds
polyacrylamide gel. after electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to an immobilon-p transfer membrane (mil-
lipore; bedford, united kingdom) according to standard
procedures. membranes were blocked in tris-buffered sa-
line containing 0.05% tween-20 (tbs-t) and 5% nonfat
dry milk (bio-rad) for 1 h. after blocking, membranes
were probed overnight at 4°c with primary antibodies in
antibody dilution buffer (tbs-t containing 1% nonfat dry
milk), followed by 1 h of incubation with secondary anti-
body at room temperature. antibody detection was accom-
plished with supersignal west pico or supersignal west
femto maximum sensitivity substrate (pierce, rockford,
illinois) using a lumi-imager
(roche, mannheim,
germany).
the following mouse monoclonal primary antibodies
were used: anti–caspase-3 (clone 19) from bd transduc-
tion laboratories (lexington, kentucky) and anti–␤-actin
(clone ac-15) from sigma. rabbit polyclonal antibodies
included anti–fk506-binding protein 12 (fkbp12) (ab-

lesterol diet (17). subsequently, ring segments of these
cuffed arteries were incubated in serum-free f10 ham
medium at 37°c with or without everolimus (10 ␮mol/l;
novartis, basel, switzerland). everolimus was stored light
protected at ⫺20°c as a 10 mmol/l stock solution in
ethanol. we used only fresh dilutions of the everolimus
stock in serum-free culture medium. because everolimus is
unstable in aqueous solution, culture medium containing
everolimus was refreshed every 12 h. after 3 days, the ring
segments were prepared for transmission electron micros-
copy.

smc, or explanted atherosclerotic segments were ﬁxed in

the percentage strut circumference surrounded by macro-

plaque, de novo protein synthesis, cell viability, and degra-
dation of long-lived proteins, and the data of the in vitro
effect of everolimus on the mtor pathway and protein
synthesis in cultured macrophages and smc were com-
pared among groups by using one-way analysis of variance
(anova) followed by the dunnett test. if the variances
were unequal (levene test for homogeneity of variances;
p ⬍ 0.05) then logarithmically transformed values (with
homogenous variances) were analyzed. the relative expres-
sion of mtor mrna and the viability of macrophages and
smc were compared between mtor sirna- and
sicontrol-treated cells by using unpaired student t test. the
spss software package 12.0 (spss inc., chicago, illinois)
was used for these purposes.
results
in vivo experiments. polymer control and everolimus-
eluting stents were implanted in atherosclerotic arteries of
cholesterol-fed rabbits. after 1 month, plaques treated with
polymer control stents were characterized by the presence of
macrophages and smc (figs. 1a, 1c, and 1e). in contrast,
in plaques treated with everolimus-eluting stents the mac-
rophage content around the stent struts was signiﬁcantly
(⬎90%) reduced without changing the smooth muscle cell
content (figs. 1b, 1d, and 1e). moreover, macrophages
were also effectively cleared throughout the atherosclerotic
plaque (fig. 1f).

in vitro experiments. western blot experiments showed

the everolimus receptor protein fkbp12 as well as phos-
phorylated (ser2448) and total mtor, which binds the
everolimus-fkbp12 complex (fig. 2a). everolimus treat-
ment resulted in dephosphorylation of the downstream

tive data are presented in table 1. everolimus also inhibited

death was obtained not only with everolimus but also with
the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (figs. 3e and 3f).
to ensure an involvement of mtor in everolimus-induced
cell death, gene-silencing experiments with mtor-speciﬁc
sirna were performed. down-regulation of mtor gene
expression was demonstrated at the mrna (fig. 4a) and
protein (fig. 4b) levels in both cell types after transfection
with mtor-speciﬁc sirna but not with sicontrol non-
targeting sirna. the mtor gene silencing was associated
with selective induction of macrophage cell death (fig. 4c),
indicating that mtor is the primary target of everolimus,
leading to macrophage-speciﬁc cell death.
cycloheximide-induced macrophage cell death was asso-
ciated with cleavage of caspase-3 and internucleosomal
dna fragmentation (fig. 5a). however, the type of cell
death induced by everolimus was not characterized by these
features, notwithstanding that levels of procaspase-3 in
macrophages decreased during treatment (fig. 5a). bulk
degradation of long-lived proteins occurred in macrophages
after treatment with everolimus but not in smc (fig. 5b).
moreover, everolimus-treated macrophages showed conver-
sion of the 18-kda protein lc3-i into the 16-kda protein
lc3-ii (fig. 5c), resulting in an increased lc3-ii/lc3-i
ratio. the ratio of lc3-ii to lc3-i in smc remained
unaffected during everolimus administration. nonetheless,
smc underwent bulk degradation of long-lived proteins, as
well as processing of lc3 in response to amino acid
deprivation by using earle’s balanced salt solution (ebss)
(figs. 5b and 5c).
transmission electron microscopy. everolimus-treated
macrophages in culture showed an intact nonpyknotic
nucleus and numerous vacuoles in the cytoplasm (figs. 6b
to 6d), whereas control macrophages did not display
vacuolization (fig. 6a). transmission electron microscopy
of everolimus-treated macrophages in explanted atheroscle-
rotic segments derived from collar-treated rabbit carotid
arteries showed cell shrinkage, depletion of organelles, and
presence of large autophagosomes containing membranous
whorls and remnants of cytoplasmic material (figs. 7a and
7b). these ﬁndings were not observed in everolimus-treated
smc, either in culture (figs. 6e and 6f) or in explanted
atherosclerotic segments (figs. 7c and 7d).
discussion
the major ﬁnding of this study is that mtor inhibition by
everolimus led to a selective removal of macrophages within
rabbit atherosclerotic plaques without inﬂuencing the via-
bility of smc. this observation is important in the context
of plaque stabilization, because it is generally assumed that
presence of macrophages triggers plaque destabilization (5).
although it has been reported that statins can reduce
macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques (6), they do not
reduce mortality for several months (18). therefore, there is

(a) western blot analysis of everolimus-binding protein fkbp12 and phosphory-
lated (ser2448) and total mtor. ␤-actin served as a loading control. (b) western
blot analysis of phosphorylated and total p70 s6 kinase in cells treated with
everolimus (10 ␮mol/l) for 0 to 12 h showed dephosphorylation of the down-
stream mtor target p70 s6 kinase at site thr389 and to a lesser extent at sites
thr421/ser424. everolimus treatment also resulted in an increased expression of
the downstream mtor target 4e-bp1 without changing its phosphorylation at site
thr37/46. this corresponds to a relative reduction of 4e-bp1 phosphorylation. in
contrast, phosphorylation of initiation factor eif2␣ and elongation factor eef2
increased. all of these effects were similar between m⌽ and smc. all protein
bands correspond to their molecular weight (size markers not shown). (c) adminis-
tration of everolimus (10 ␮mol/l) resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of de novo pro-

make it possible to “buy time” until systemic therapies
confer signiﬁcant protection (18).

rapidly decreased, indicating a cell type-speciﬁc initiation
of cell death.
everolimus binds with high afﬁnity to fkbp12; this
complex subsequently binds to mtor, inhibiting its func-
tion. to examine whether the observed induction of cell
death in macrophages by everolimus is related to the
inhibition of mtor and is not merely a consequence of
binding to fkbp12, additional experiments with tacrolimus
(fk506; a rapamycin analog) were performed. although
tacrolimus also binds to fkbp12, only the everolimus-
fkbp12 complex but not the tacrolimus-fkbp12 complex

likely attributed to the lipophilic properties of everolimus,
because the drug may pass easily through cell membranes,
enabling mural distribution.
the mechanism of selective macrophage clearance by
everolimus-eluting stents was subsequently unraveled in
in vitro experiments. because mtor controls translation
(19), the effect of everolimus on the protein synthesis
effectors p70 s6 kinase, 4e-bp1, eif2␣, and eef2 was
examined in both macrophages and smc. these exper-
iments showed a dephosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase and
4e-bp1 as well as a hyperphosphorylation of eif2␣ and
eef2, all strongly indicating inhibition of protein trans-
lation via mtor inhibition. moreover, de novo protein
synthesis was signiﬁcantly inhibited by everolimus. these
effects occurred in both macrophages and smc. how-

death induced by cycloheximide and everolimus
(a) macrophages and smooth muscle cells (smc) were treated with cyclohexi-
mide (10␮g/ml) or everolimus (10 ␮mol/l) for 0 to 24 h. to characterize the
type of cell death induced by both compounds, cleavage of procaspase-3
(procasp-3) and internucleosomal dna fragmentation (both apoptosis markers)
were analyzed using western blotting (upper panel) and agarose gel electro-
phoresis (lower panel), respectively. smc treated with the combination of
tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha (30 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (chx, 20
␮g/ml) for 12 h served as a positive control. (b) assaying degradation of long-
lived proteins as a biochemical marker for autophagy was studied by treating
cells with everolimus (10 ␮mol/l) or earle’s balanced salt solution (ebss) for
12 h. versus control: **p ⬍ 0.01; ***p ⬍ 0.001. (c) western blot analysis

representative of 3 independent experiments.

is a highly speciﬁc inhibitor of mtor (20). tacrolimus, at
the same concentration as everolimus, did not result in
macrophage cell death in culture, conﬁrming that the
induction of cell death in macrophages by everolimus is a
consequence of mtor inhibition. this is in accordance
with a recent report showing that in vivo treatment with
tacrolimus did not affect the amount of macrophages in
atherosclerotic plaques of collared apoe⫺/⫺ mice, either in
de novo (developing) atherosclerosis or in pre-existing
lesions (21). additional evidence for an involvement of
mtor in everolimus-induced cell death was provided by
gene-silencing experiments with mtor-speciﬁc sirna.
the mtor gene silencing was associated with selective
induction of macrophage cell death, further indicating that
mtor is the primary target of everolimus leading to
macrophage-speciﬁc cell death.
massive cell type-speciﬁc initiation of cell death was
obtained not only with everolimus but also with the trans-
lation inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that inhibition of
protein translation suppresses normal macrophage function,
which in turn leads to macrophage cell death. in contrast, it
has been reported that inhibition of translation in smc
induces a modulation towards a differentiated, quiescent,
contractile phenotype (22) which renders the cells less
sensitive to cell death mediated by inhibition of protein
translation. in this context, it is important to note that
macrophages are metabolically highly active whereas smc
are not. cycloheximide-induced macrophage cell death
corresponded with apoptosis, as shown by cleavage of
caspase-3 and internucleosomal dna fragmentation. how-
ever, the type of cell death induced by everolimus was not
characterized by these apoptotic features, notwithstanding
that levels of procaspase-3 in macrophages decreased during
treatment as a result of nonspeciﬁc protein degradation.
therefore, induction of nonapoptotic cell death such as
autophagy was considered.

autophagy is a major intracellular degradation process
ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells. in normal conditions, auto-
phagy contributes to the turnover of cellular components by
delivering portions of the cytoplasm and organelles to
lysosomes (23). continuous stimulation of this cellular
degradation process leads to autophagic cell destruction,
also known as type ii programmed cell death (23,24).
induction of autophagic cell death by inhibition of mtor
is tightly controlled in eukaryotic cells. experiments in yeast
showed that the tor pathway regulates phosphorylation of
atg13, a protein important for autophagy (25). the atg13
protein is phosphorylated in healthy cells but rapidly de-
phosphorylated upon inhibition of tor, stimulating its
afﬁnity to atg1. this atg1-atg13 association is required for
induction of autophagy, because it is part of a putative
complex that regulates preautophagosomal membrane for-
mation. autophagy was detected by bulk degradation of
long-lived proteins in everolimus-treated macrophages but
not in smc and by an increased lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio, a
reliable marker of autophagosome formation (26). the ratio
of lc3-ii to lc3-i in smc remained unaffected during
everolimus administration, suggesting absence of autoph-
agy. these biochemical hallmarks of autophagy were con-
ﬁrmed by transmission electron microscopy, which is con-
sidered the gold standard for morphologic assessment of
autophagy (26). autophagic features include an intact non-
pyknotic nucleus and numerous vacuoles in the cytoplasm.
similar ﬁndings were observed in explanted atherosclerotic
segments derived from collar-treated rabbit carotid arteries
incubated with everolimus.
the consequences of autophagy in macrophages of hu-
man atherosclerotic plaques are currently unknown. how-

ever, autophagy rather than apoptosis is likely to be the
preferred type of cell death to clear macrophages from
atherosclerotic plaques. massive apoptotic cell death of
macrophages is associated with depletion of phagocytes and
with the production of a large number of apoptotic bodies in
the atherosclerotic plaque. the accumulation of apoptotic
bodies in a condition of defective phagocytic clearance
eventually results in secondary necrosis of the apoptotic
bodies, which contributes to necrotic core formation, in-
ﬂammation, and thrombosis. these phenomena may fur-
ther promote plaque instability and increase the risk of acute
atherothrombotic clinical events (27).
although experimental plaques do not represent a human
“vulnerable” situation, the present results are novel in that
the drug-induced autophagy in macrophages is an addi-
tional strength of stents eluting an mtor inhibitor, on top
of their well-described reduced rate of in-stent restenosis
(28), the latter being beyond the scope of the present study.
in conclusion, mtor inhibition by everolimus leads to a
selective, clean, and safe removal of macrophages within the
atherosclerotic plaque without inﬂuencing the viability of
smc. this selective clearance of macrophages occurred by
autophagy due to everolimus-induced inhibition of mtor,
which is a novel mechanism to induce cell death in mam-
malian cells. therefore, stent-based delivery of an mtor
inhibitor is a promising method to selectively remove
macrophages from the atherosclerotic plaque without affect-
ing viability of smc, favoring plaque stability.
