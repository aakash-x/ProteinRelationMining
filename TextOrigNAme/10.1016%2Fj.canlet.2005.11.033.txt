abstract
the proteasome-mediated protein degradation is critical for regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle, cell
death, differentiation and immune response. proteasome inhibitors have recently been shown to be potent anti-cancer agents
against a variety of cancer cells. our study demonstrated that proteasome inhibitor mg132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyle-l-leucyl-l-
leucinal) was a potent death-inducing agent for pc3 prostate cancer cells. mg132-induced cell death was partially inhibited by
pan-caspase inhibitor zavd-fmk and translational inhibitor cycloheximide. to understand the signaling pathways of proteasome
inhibitor-induced cell death, we performed gene proﬁling study using affymetrix human dna microarrays to identify the genes
whose expression was affected by proteasome inhibitor mg132 in pc3 cells. the genes with more than threefold increased
expression induced by mg132 were functionally categorized into the following groups: heat shock and chaperone proteins,
ubiquitination and protein degradation, transcription/translation factors, cell death and cell cycle arrest, signaling molecules and
enzymes, and secreted cytokines. among them, heat shock proteins and anti-oxidant enzymes may promote cell survival, while
pro-death proteins such as gadd45b and stk17a may promote cell death. interestingly, expression of a few autophagic genes
was elevated by mg132 treatment. furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partially inhibited mg132-induced cell
death, indicating that autophagic cell death may contribute to mg132-induced cell death. taken together, our results demonstrated
that proteasome inhibition elicits activation of multiple signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells.

1. introduction
the ubiquitin–proteasome system (ups) is the
principal non-lysosomal system for degradation of
intracellular protein [1]. it is instrumental to a variety
of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell cycle

regulation, gene expression, cell differentiation and
immune response [1,2]. inhibition of the proteasome
pathway results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
thereby making the proteasome a novel anti-cancer
target [3,4]. bortezomib (millennium pharmaceuticals,
inc., also known as velcade or ps-341) is the ﬁrst
proteasome inhibitor to be approved for treatment of
relapsed multiple myeloma (mm) [5,6]. the promising
anti-cancer activity by bortezomib in mm and other
malignancies has further proved that the proteasome is
a legitimate target in cancer treatment.

the molecular mechanism of proteasome inhibitor-
mediated anti-cancer activity has recently been under
extensive study in mm and other cancer cells.
inhibition of the normal function of the proteasome
usually leads to cell cycle arrest and cell death in
various types of cells. in mm cells, inhibition of the
nf-kb pathway appears to be one of the main
mechanisms by which proteasome inhibitors induce
apoptosis and overcome drug resistance [6]. nf-kb is
the major transcription factor in the rel/nf-kb family
that plays critical roles in cell growth and survival, and
induction of various cytokines and adhesion molecules
[7]. inhibition of the proteasome prevents ikb, the
inhibitor of nf-kb, from proteasome-mediated degra-
dation, which in turn results in cytoplasmic retention of
inactive nf-kb [7]. inhibition of nf-kb transcriptional
activity leads to the decreased expression of survival
factors such as bcl-2 and ciap-2, and blocks micro-
environmental changes favorable for tumor growth,
including adhesion of mm cells to stroma, angiogenesis
and nf-kb-mediated induction of growth factors such
as il-6 [8]. furthermore, the gene expression proﬁling
study in mm cells treated with bortezomib demon-
strated that
the drug activated both extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways [9].
to further elucidate the signaling pathways of
proteasome inhibitor-induced cell death in other types
of cells, here we report our gene proﬁling study of
prostate cancer cell pc3 treated with mg132 (carbo-
benzoxy-l-leucyle-l-leucyl-l-leucinal), a potent pro-
teasome inhibitor. in this study, we demonstrated that
proteasome inhibition led to activation of multiple
signaling pathways in pc3 cells.
2. results
2.1. mg132-induced cell death in both caspase-
dependent and -independent manners
previous studies have demonstrated that proteasome
inhibitors are potent apoptosis-inducing agents for
cancer cells. as shown in fig. 1, proteasome inhibitor
mg132 (1 and 10 mm) induced massive cell death of
sv40-transformed mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (mef)
cells as well as prostate cancer pc3 cells, indicated by
shrunken cell body and condensed dna (fig. 1a and
b). interestingly, cycloheximide (1 mg/ml) remarkably
inhibited cell death induced by mg132 (1 mm) (81.3 vs
13.7% for mef, and 76.1 vs 27.2% for pc3) (fig. 1c
and d). this result indicates that continuous protein
synthesis is required for mg132-induced cell death.
caspases play critical roles in the initiation and
execution of apoptotic cell death [10]. to investigate
the role of caspase in mg132-induced cell death, we
tested if zvad-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-vad-ﬂuor-
omethyl ketone), a potent pan-caspase inhibitor, was
capable of inhibiting mg132-induced cell death. as
shown in fig. 1, zvad-fmk (100 mm) partially
inhibited mg132-induced cell death of mef (81.3 vs
22.8% for 1 mm mg132, and 87.7 vs 44.5% for 10 mm
mg132), and pc3 cells (76.1 vs 32.5%) (fig. 1c and
d). this result indicates that both caspase-dependent
and -independent pathways are activated by inhibition
of the proteasome.
2.2. gene expression proﬁle of mg132-treated pc3
cells
in an attempt to deﬁne the signaling pathway of
mg132-induced cell death, we used oligonucleotide
microarray analysis to examine the gene expression
proﬁle of mg132-treated pc3 cells. to examine the
immediate effect of mg132 treatment, we treated pc3
cells with mg132 (1 and 10 mm) for 6 h when no
apparent cell death was observed (data not shown). the
gene expression proﬁle of treated cells was compared to
the one of untreated cells using affymetrix u133a
chipset that covers more than 30,000 human genes. in
agreement with previous proﬁling studies, inhibition of
the proteasome by mg132 elicited distinct changes in a
number of signaling pathways [9,11]. according to
reported gene functions, we categorized the genes
whose expression displayed more than three-fold
increase after mg132 treatment
into a number of
functional groups (table 1).
2.2.1. heat shock proteins and co-chaperones
heat shock response was one of the major responses
to inhibition of the proteasome. as shown in table 1,
most of chaperone protein families including hsp70,
hsp40, hsp110 and hsp27, and chaperone-binding
protein including bag3, and hsp90 co-chaperones
(aha1 and chp-1), were up-regulated. heat shock
response is also activated in bortezomib-treated mm
cells, and is generally believed as a pro-survival
mechanism [9].
2.2.2. protein ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like proteins
brap2 is a brca1-associated protein containing
ubiquitin-like domains [12], while sequestosome 1
(p62) is a polyubiquitin chain binding protein involved
in ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated protein degradation
[13]. highly induced by mg132, these two proteins are
probably involved in protein ubiquitination and

up-regulation of the genes induced by mg132 treatment. pc3 cells were treated with mg132 (1 mm or 10 mm) for 6 h. the gene expression proﬁle
was characterized by microarray analysis using affymetrix u133 chip sets. the control was untreated pc3 cells. the data were the average of three
independent experiments. the table showed the genes with more than threefold increased expression by mg132 (10 mm) treatment. similar groups
of genes were induced to less extent by lower concentration of mg132 (1 mm) (our unpublished data).
degradation. interestingly, a few ubiquitin-like proteins
including gaba(a) receptor-associated protein like 1
(gabarap1) and microtubule-associated protein
1-light chain 3 (map1-lc3) were also up-regulated,
indicating that other protein modiﬁcations mediated by
ubiquitin-like proteins may occur.
2.2.3. proteins involved in regulation of transcription
and translation
our data showed that a number of proteins involved
in regulation of transcription and translation were up-
regulated by mg132 treatment (table 1). atf3
(activation transcription factor 3) was identiﬁed as
one of the early transcription factors induced by
proteasome inhibition [11]. fork head-like protein
foxo3a is a transcription factor involved in multiple
signaling pathways including apoptosis [14]. endo-
thelial pas domain protein (epas1) is also known as
hypoxia-inducible factor 2a, which plays a role in stress
response and angiogenesis [15]. eif5 (eukaryotic
initiation factor 5) was identiﬁed by proteomic analysis
as a protein that accumulates during inhibition of the
proteasome and plays an important role in apoptosis
induced by proteasome inhibitors [16]. transcriptional
up-regulation of eif5 may be one of the mechanisms
for eif5 accumulation upon proteasome inhibition.
2.2.4. signaling molecules and metabolic enzymes
apoptosis-inducing kinase 17a (also know as
stk17a or dap kinase-related apoptosis-inducing
protein kinase 1 or drak1) [17] and phosphatase 1
were up-regulated by mg132 treatment. mg132 also
increased the transcription of gadd34 and gadd45b
that mediate growth arrest and apoptosis induced by
uv radiation and chemotherapy [18,19]. interestingly,
a number of metabolic enzymes involving in regulation
of amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress,
including xct (cystine/glutamate transporter), gclm
(glutamate–cysteine ligase, modiﬁer subunit), hmox1
(heme oxygenase 1) and got1 (glutamic-oxaloacetic
transaminase 1), were induced upon mg132 treatment,
indicating the induction of oxidative stress upon
proteasome inhibition.
2.2.5. growth factors and cytokines
surprisingly, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as
il-8 and il-12 whose expression is normally nf-kb-
dependent were also up-regulated in mg132-treated
pc3 cells, indicating that nf-kb-independent path-
ways may exist to regulate the transcription of these
cytokines. mg132 treatment increased expression of
stanniocalin 2, the mammalian homolog of a calcium-
and phosphate-regulating hormone ﬁrst identiﬁed in
222

ﬁsh. it was reported that expression of stanniocalin 2
was rapidly up-regulated as a cytoprotective signal in
response to unfolded proteins, oxidative stress and
hypoxia in neuronal cells [20]. in contrast, inhibin
(activin a),
testin and epiregulin may inhibit cell
proliferation and induce apoptosis [21–23].
stress (induced by inhibitor of protein glycosylation
tunicamycin) (fig. 2a). furthermore, overexpression
of these genes induced cell death of pc3 cells (fig. 2b).
this result
increased expression of
multiple pro-death genes may contribute to mg132-
induced cell death.
indicates that
2.3. overexpression of pro-death genes induced cell
death of pc3 cells
among the genes up-regulated by mg132 treatment,
a number of them are implicated in regulation of cell
death. we selected ﬁve death-relevant genes to test
whether increased expression of these genes could
induce cell death of pc3 cells. gadd45b and
gadd34 are involved in growth arrest and apoptosis
induced by genotoxic stress [18,19], while foxo3a is a
member of fork-head transcript factor family that play a
critical role in regulating the transcription of fas ligand
[24] and pro-apoptotic bcl-2 member bim [25,26].
stk17a, also know as drak1 (dap kinase-related
apoptosis-inducing protein kinase 1), is a member of
dap (death-associated protein) kinase family [20].
ectopic expression of stk17a led to apoptosis in nih
3t3 and cos-7 cells [20]. rtp801 is an hif-1
responsive gene that is strongly induced by hypoxia,
and is involved in regulation of apoptosis [27]. as
shown in fig. 2a, we conﬁrmed the induction of these
genes by mg132 treatment using rt-pcr and northern
blotting (data not shown). interestingly, these genes
were also up-regulated by genotoxic stress (induced by
dna topoisomerase ii inhibitor etoposide) and er
2.4. mg132-induced autophagic cell death of pc3 cells
autophagic cell death is a different form of cell death
from apoptosis, and is characterized by appearance of
autophagic vesicles and degradation of cytoplasmic
components and organelles [28]. autophagy involves
the formation of autophagic vesicles and fusion of the
vesicles with lysosomes for ﬁnal degradation of their
content. genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated the
involvement of ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in
autophagic vesicle formation [28]. yeast apg12 (newly
named atg12) and apg8 (atg8), two ubiquitin-like
proteins, are activated by an e1-like enzyme apg7
(atg7) and transferred to apg5 (atg5) or lipid
membrane, respectively. formation of apg12 and
apg8-modiﬁed complexes are essential for membrane
elongation of autophagosomes. apg6 (atg6 or beclin
1) is a component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
complex, while apg10 (atg10) is an e2-like enzyme
for apg12/apg5 conjugation. as shown in table 1,
microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3 (map1-
lc3), a homolog of yeast autophagy gene apg8, was up-
regulated by mg132 treatment, indicating that inhibition
of the proteasome may induce autophagy. interestingly,
our gene proﬁling data showed that expression of other

mg132-up-regulated genes induced apoptosis of pc3 cells. pc3 cells were transiently transfected with the constructs expressing indicated genes
along with egfp marker. after 24-incubation, cells were collected and cell death was scored by dna staining of gfp positive cells. cells with
condensed dna were counted as dead cells.

(3-methyladenine, 5 mm), and then stained with hoechst dye. (c) quantiﬁcation of cell death scored by dna staining. cells with condensed dna
were scored as dead cells.
autophagy-related genes was also elevated by mg132,
including atg12 (1.81-fold increase), atg7 (1.24-fold)
and atg5 (1.47-fold). we further examined the
expression proﬁle of these autophagy-related genes by
rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 3a, expression of map1-
lc3, atg7 and atg12 was increased upon mg132
treatment, while atg5, atg6 (beclin 1) and atg10
remained relatively unchanged. this result conﬁrmed that
both ubiquitin-like proteins lc3 and atg12 were up-
regulated by proteasome inhibition. to determine if
autophagic cell death is involved in mg132-induced cell
death, we examined if 3-methyladenine (3-ma), an
inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol kinases and autophagy,
inhibited mg132-induced cell death. as shown in fig. 3b
and c, 3-ma (5 mm) partially but signiﬁcantly inhibited
mg132-induced cell death, indicating that autophagic
cell death may contribute in part to mg132-induced cell
death.

mg132-treated cells showed distorted nuclei with
partially condensed chromatin, whereas untreated cells
displayed normal nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology
with few lysosomes. additionally, the electron-dense
structures were observed in both cytoplasm and nucleus
of nearly every treated cell (fig. 4, panels b–g), while
most of mitochondria lost their intermembrane space
and distinguishable cristae structures (fig. 4, panel c).
higher magniﬁcation pictures showed that most of the
electron-dense spots aggregated together with surround-
ing membranes, which may form autophagosomes
(panel d). interestingly, the electron-dense structures
with various morphologies were also observed in nuclei
(fig. 4, panels e–g). in contrast to the cytoplasmic
structures,
the nuclear ones were not encircled by
membranes.
3. discussion
the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway is a novel thera-
peutic target for cancer treatment. newly developed
proteasome inhibitors have been potent anti-cancer
agents for various cancers, yet their underlying molecular
mechanism remains to be elucidated. we report here the
gene proﬁling study on prostate cancer pc3 cells treated
with proteasome inhibitor mg132. our data indicate that
both pro-and anti-cell death pathways are up-regulated by
proteasome inhibitor mg132 in prostate cancer pc3 cells.
in agreement with previous studies [9,11], our microarray
analysis demonstrated that up-regulation of heat shock
proteins (hsp), including hsp70, hsp40, hsp110 families,
hsp27 and certain co-chaperones, was the most
pronounced response to mg132 treatment. stress-
induced up-regulation of heat shock proteins is generally
believed to confer a protective effect against proteasome
inhibition [9]. therefore,
inhibition of heat shock
response may sensitize cancer cells to proteasome
inhibitors.
expression of some enzymes that are involved in
anti-oxidative response, including sat, gclm, was
also increased in the presence of mg132. proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib was reported to induce reactive
oxygen species (ros) generation in various cancer
cells such as non-small cell lung cancer cells, leukemia
cells and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells
[29–31]. ros was implicated to be the primary cause
for bortezomib-induced apoptosis of those cells [29–
31]. our study suggests that up-regulation of anti-
oxidative enzymes may be a cellular self-protective
mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition.
therefore, suppression of the cellular anti-oxidative
mechanism may enhance the anti-cancer activity of

225
proteasome inhibitors. on the other hand, anti-oxidant
agents may protect cells from proteasome inhibitor-
induced cell death.
proteasome inhibition by mg132 also triggers
multiple pathways that are involved in regulation of
cell death. inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein
degradation may result in the accumulation of unfolded
proteins that
leads to activation of the so-called
unfolded protein response (upr) and up-regulation of
atf4 and gadd34 [32]. gadd45b is involved in
regulation of cell cycle and cell death in response to
cellular stresses such as dna damage [19]. further-
more, up-regulation of transcription factor fkhrl1/
foxo3a may lead to the increased expression of its
downstream pro-apoptotic targets such as fas ligand
and bim [24,26]. interestingly,
transcription of a
number of cytokines is also elevated in response to
mg132, which may confer both pro- and anti-apoptotic
activities. for example, stanniocalcin 2 is a calcium-
and phosphate-regulating hormone that is induced by
unfolded protein response and oxidative stress. over-
expression of stanniocalcin 2 renders n2a and hela
cells resistant
to thapsigargin-induced cell death,
indicating its cytoprotective activity [20]. in contrast,
testin, epiregulin, pregnancy-induced growth inhibitor
and inhibin were reported to inhibit cell proliferation or
promote apoptosis [21–23]. taken together, our result
suggests that multiple cytotoxic and cytoprotective
pathways are induced and up-regulated in the presence
of proteasome inhibition, and the fate of cells with
defective protein degradation machinery may be
determined by a network of multiple pathways.
additionally, a few ubiquitin-like proteins, such as
gaba(a) receptor-associated protein like 1 and
microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3
(map1-lc3), are also up-regulated, indicating that
protein modiﬁcation by ubiquitin-like molecules may
be elevated when the proteasome is inhibited.
autophagy is a mechanism by which both yeast and
mammalian cells degrade and recycle cytoplasmic
components. autophagic cell death is an alternative
form of programmed cell death that utilizes the cellular
autophagic apparatus. map1-lc3 is the mammalian
homolog of yeast autophagy protein apg8 (atg8) that
is involved in the modiﬁcation of autophagosomal
membrane and the formation of autophagosome [33].
our microarray and rt-pcr data indicate that lc3 and
atg12, two ubiquitin-like proteins, are up-regulated
by proteasome inhibition. atg7, an e1-like enzyme
for lc3 and atg12,
is also induced by mg132
treatment. moreover, mg132-induced cell death is
partially inhibited by autophagy inhibitor 3-ma. these
observations suggest that autophagic cell death may
contribute in part to the cytotoxicity of mg132 in pc3
cells. it was reported that inhibition of the tor pathway
led to transcriptional up-regulation of yeast apg8 gene
[34]. nonetheless, whether autophagy genes are up-
regulated during other autophagic cell deaths remains
to be further investigated.
interestingly, two distinct subcellular morphological
changes have been observed in the presence of
proteasome and caspase inhibitor. first,
the inner
space and cristae structures of mitochondria were
eliminated in the presence of mg132 (fig. 4, panel c).
in contrast, the outer mitochondrial membrane often
ruptures in apoptotic cell death [35]. further study will
determine the cause and functional consequence of these
mitochondrial changes. second,
the electron-dense
structures were observed in both cytoplasm and nucleus,
but the nuclear ones were not surrounded by membrane
(fig. 4). the cytoplasmic electron-dense structures may
include previously described aggresomes or inclusion
bodies [36], whereas the physiological nature of nuclear
aggregates remains to be further elucidated. it is of great
interest to further explore the molecular mechanism
underlying the correlation between the formation of
aggregates and cell death.
4. methods
4.1. tissue culture and agents
prostate cell line pc3 was obtained from atcc and
maintained in rpmi1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and antibiotics. sv40-transformed mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts (mef, a kind gift of dr stanley
korsmeyer) were cultured in dmem supplement with
10% calf serum. proteasome inhibitor mg132 (carbo-
benzoxy-l-leucyle-l-leucyl-l-leucinal) was purchased
from calbiochem. cycloheximide and 3-methyla-
denine were purchased from sigma.
4.2. transfection and cell death assays
cells were treated with mg132 in the presence of
cycloheximide or 3-methyadenine for indicated periods
of time. dna dye (hoescht 32258) was added into the
medium, and dead cells were scored by condensed and
bright nuclei. to examine the function of speciﬁc
genes, various genes were co-transfected into pc3 cells
along with egfp marker using lipofectamine 2000
(invitrogen). after 24-h transfection, the percentage of
cell death was scored by dna staining of gfp positive
cells. cells with condensed dna were scored as dead
226
w. yang et al. / cancer letters 243 (2006) 217–227
cells, while cells with normal nuclei were scored as live
cells.
4.3. affymetrix chip hybridization and analysis
after treatment of cells with mg132, total rna was
extracted using trizol (life technologies inc.),
following the manufacture’s instructions, and further
puriﬁed with rneasy mini columns (qiagen). the ﬁrst
strand of cdna was synthesized using superscript
choice system (invitrogen) using t7-(oligo-dt)24
primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. an
in vitro transcription reaction was performed using the
enzo bioarray high yield rna transcript labeling
kit (enzo) to synthesize biotin-labeled crna that was
further puriﬁed and fragmented. hybridization, wash-
ing, staining and scanning was performed according to
affymetrix’s procedure. human u133a chipsets were
used for proﬁling. staining was done in the genechip
fluidics station using pre-programmed affymetrix
protocols. the probed arrays were scanned in the
affymetrix genechip scanner. the data were collected
and analyzed with microsoft excel. three independent
experiments were performed, and the average of three
samples was used for calculation of changes of gene
expression.
4.4. rt-pcr and primers used in this study
total rna of each treatment was extracted
by trizol reagent (invitrogen) following manufac-
turer’s protocol. for reverse transcription, 4 mg of
total rna was transcribed by superscript first-
strand synthesis system (invitrogen) for rt-pcr.
pcr reaction included using 2 ml of complementary
dna with 0.2 mm dntp mix, 2 mm mgcl2, 10!
pcr buffer. one unit taq polymerase, and 100 mm
primers. the pcr reaction was performed as
follow: 94 8c (1 min), 55 8c (1.5 min) and 72 8c
(0.5 min) for 30 cycles for all of genes except actin
(25 cycles for actin control). the following is the
primers used for rt-pcr of indicated genes:
