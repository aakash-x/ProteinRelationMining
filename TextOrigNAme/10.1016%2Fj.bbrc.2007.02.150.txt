abstract
autophagy is the bulk degradation of cytosolic materials in lysosomes/vacuoles of eukaryotic cells. in the yeast saccharomyces cere-
visiae, 17 atg proteins are known to be involved in autophagosome formation. genome wide analyses have shown that atg17 interacts
with numerous proteins. further studies on these interacting proteins may provide further insights into membrane dynamics during
autophagy. here, we identify cis1/atg31 as a protein that exhibits similar phenotypes to atg17. atg31 null cells were defective in
autophagy and lost viability under starvation conditions. localization of atg31 to pre-autophagosomal structures (pas) was dependent
on atg17. coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that atg31 interacts with atg17. together, atg31 is a novel protein that, in
concert with atg17, is required for proper autophagosome formation.

autophagy is an intracellular degradation system that
responds to nutrient starvation. the process is highly con-
served from yeast to higher eukaryotes. upon induction,
cytoplasmic components, including organelles, are enclosed
in double membrane structures, termed autophagosomes,
and delivered to the lysosome/vacuole to be degraded.

about 30 autophagy-related (atg) genes have been
identiﬁed in yeast and are required for the degradative
autophagic pathway, the biosynthetic cytoplasm to vacuole
(cvt) pathway, or both. both pathways are accompanied
by topologically similar membrane phenomena. the cvt
pathway is a selective process that transports at least two
vacuolar resident hydrolases, aminopeptidase i (ape1) [3]
and a-mannosidase [4], via small double-membrane vesi-
cles, termed cvt vesicles [5,6]. there is a signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in the sizes of the autophagosome (300–900 nm in
diameter) and the cvt vesicle (140–160 nm) [6]. studies in
yeast have shown that 17 atg proteins, atg1–10, 12–14,
16–18, and atg29, are involved in autophagosome (ap)
formation. hereafter, these proteins will be referred to as
ap-atg proteins. among these proteins, atg17 and
atg29 are dispensable for cvt vesicle formation, although
most ap-atg proteins are required for formation of cvt
vesicles.
atg17 was initially identiﬁed by two-hybrid screen using
atg1 as bait [7]. atg13 and atg17 are involved in activation
of the kinase, atg1 [7]. previous studies have demonstrated
406
y. kabeya et al. / biochemical and biophysical research communications 356 (2007) 405–410
that atg17 forms a complex with atg1 and atg13 under
starvation conditions, and this physical
interaction is
required for proper autophagosome formation [8]. a sys-
tematic ﬂuorescence microscopy analysis showed that
atg17 is essential for organization of the pas [9].
a genome wide two-hybrid assay and a global mass spec-
trometry analysis in s. cerevisiae suggested that atg17 inter-
acts with numerous proteins [10,11]. these proteins are
additional candidates to function together with atg17 in
autophagy, and we have now tested whether they are
required for autophagy.
intriguingly, one disruptant,
ydr022cd/cis1d, showed a defect in autophagosome forma-
tion. cis1 was originally identiﬁed as a suppressor of cik1,
a kinesin-associated protein that is localized to the spindle
pole bodies and is required for both karyogamy and mitotic
spindle organization [12–14]. a previous study showed that
overexpression of cis1 rescued the temperature-sensitive
growth defect of cik1d cells [12]. however, in our hands,
the function of cis1 as a suppressor of cik1 was quite
weak. rather, cis1d cells showed a distinctive defect in
autophagy, similar to atg17d cells. here, we demonstrate
that the cis1 protein functions mainly in autophagosome
formation and propose to rename cis1 as atg31.
materials and methods
yeast strains, media, and plasmids. the strains utilized in this study are
listed in table 1. media for growth of yeast cells, starvation, and induction
of autophagy have been described previously [7,15]. yky6, yky61, and
yky62 were generated using the one-step gene replacement method
described previously [16]. the region containing the disruption marker
and the ﬂanking sequences was ampliﬁed by pcr using genomic dna
prepared from the by4741 cis1d::kanmx strain [17]. the resulting cas-
sette was transformed into the yky6 strain to generate yky79. the
atg17d strain was constructed using a previously described method [7].
to obtain patg31, a 1.6 kb fragment containing the entire atg31
gene was cloned from yeast genomic dna into prs316 [18].
antibodies. antisera against ape1 [19], atg8 [20], atg12 [21], atg13 [7],
and pgk [22] were described previously. mouse monoclonal anti-myc
epitope antibody 9e10 was purchased from babco.

results
cis1d/atg31d is speciﬁcally defective in autophagy
currently, it is thought that atg17 is the most important
protein for organization of the pre-autophagosomal struc-
ture (pas); atg17 has a role in localization of other ap-
atg proteins to the pas [9]. we examined whether any
of the large number of proteins that interact with atg17
[10,11] are involved in autophagy. interestingly, a disrup-
tant, ydr022cd/cis1d, showed a defect in autophagosome
formation. manning et al. originally identiﬁed the cis1
gene as a suppressor of cik1 (chromosome instability
and karyogamy 1) [12]. in that study, a multi copy plasmid
harboring cis1 allowed cik1d cells to grow on solid med-
ium at the restrictive temperature. to substantiate the sup-
pressive activity of cis1, we overexpressed cis1 in cik1d
mutant cells. we observed minimal suppressive activity of
cis1 (data not shown), suggesting that cis1 is mainly
involved in autophagy.
wild-type cells accumulated autophagic bodies in the
vacuole under starvation conditions in the presence of
phenylmethanelusulfonylﬂuoride (pmsf), while cis1d cells
did not (fig. 1a). a defect of cis1d mutant cells was also
conﬁrmed by examining autophagic activity using the
alp assay (fig. 1b). a truncated form of pho8 (pho8d60)
expressed in the cytosol is delivered to the vacuole via
autophagy and processed to an active form [23,24]. alp
activity did not increase when the cis1d mutant cells were
cultured in starvation medium sd(-n) for 6 h, providing
further evidence that cis1 is essential for autophagy. a
low copy plasmid harboring cis1 rescued the autophagy
defect in the cis1 mutant strain (fig. 1a and b). the cis1d
cells also showed a loss of viability phenotype under nitro-
gen starvation (fig. 1c). together, these results show that
cis1 plays a critical role in autophagosome formation.
hereafter, we refer to cis1 as atg31.
the phosphorylation state of atg13 is extremely sensi-
tive to nutrient conditions in a tor-dependent manner
[7]. we examined the phosphorylation of atg13 by immu-
noblot in the presence and the absence of rapamycin
(fig. 2a). both in wild-type and atg31d cells, atg13 was
mostly hyperphosphorylated in growth medium, and was
eﬃciently dephosphorylated after rapamycin treatment.
these results suggest that atg31 is not involved in dephos-
phorylation of atg13.
autophagy requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation sys-
tems, in which atg8 and atg12 are covalently bound to
phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) and atg5, respectively
[27,28]. we assessed the amounts of pe-conjugated atg8
and atg5-conjugated atg12 in the atg31d mutant by
sds–page in the presence of 6 m urea. as shown in

fig. 1. cis1/atg31 is essential for autophagy. (a) the cis1 mutant is defective in accumulation of autophagic bodies. wild-type (by4741; a) and cis1d
(by4741 background) strains transformed with either vector alone (b) or a low copy cis1 plasmid (c) were incubated for 6 h under nitrogen and carbon
starvation conditions in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethanelusulfonylﬂuoride. dic (diﬀerential interference contrast) images are shown. bar = 5 lm.
(b) autophagic activity in cis1d cells. wild-type cells (by4741) or the indicated mutant strains (in the by4741 background) expressing pho8d60 were
shifted from yepd medium (white bars) to sd(-n) medium and incubated for 6 h (black bars). autophagic activity was measured by alkaline
phosphatase (alp) assay as described in materials and methods. error bars indicate the sd of three independent experiments. (c) the cis1d strain is
sensitive to nitrogen starvation. wild-type (by4741, closed circle), atg16d (open square), and cis1d (open circle) cells were cultured in nitrogen starvation
medium. aliquots were removed at the indicated times and spread onto yepd plates. the number of colonies was determined after 2–3 days.
fig. 2b, the atg31d mutant possessed normal levels of
atg8-pe and atg12–atg5 conjugates, indicating that the
atg31 protein is not involved in these two ubiquitin-like
reactions.
although the atg31d mutant is defective in autophago-
some formation, we found that prape1 import occurred
under both growing and starvation conditions in atg31d
cells (fig. 2c). these results show that the phenotype of
atg31d cells is very similar to those of the atg17d and
atg29d mutants, suggesting that atg31 is the third ap-
atg protein that is not required for the cvt pathway.
atg31 is localized at the pre-autophagosomal structure
(pas)
next, we examined the localization of atg31-gfp by
ﬂuorescence microscopy. atg31-gfp was chromosomally
integrated, and the atg31-gfp strain was normal
in
autophagy judging by alp assay (data not shown). the
cells were grown in sd + ca medium and treated with
rapamycin for 3 h. atg31-gfp was visible as a punctate
dot near the vacuole and diﬀused in the cytosol prior to
rapamycin treatment (fig. 3a). after treatment with rapa-
mycin for 3 h, brighter dots were observed. it is known that
most ap-atg proteins are localized at the pas, very prox-
imal to the vacuole [1]. we next examined the distribution
of atg31 and ape1, a pas marker; these two proteins were
shown to colocalize (fig. 3b). thus, the granular staining
of atg31 presented in the literature presumably represented
the pas; we were not able to see atg31 localization at the
spindle pole bodies.
the localization of ap-atg proteins is intimately inter-
connected [9]. in particular, atg17 is required for the local-
ization of other ap-atg proteins to the pas [9]. we
examined the localization of atg31-gfp in the atg17d
strain by ﬂuorescence microscopy after treatment with rap-
amycin for 3 h. as shown in fig. 3c, in the atg17d strain,
atg31-gfp punctate staining disappeared. in contrast, in
atg31d cells, atg17-gfp staining primarily showed a
pas pattern, as in wild-type cells (fig. 3c). therefore,
the pas localization of atg31-gfp requires atg17.
atg31 physically associates with atg17
the analysis of the gfp localization pattern along with
the previous two-hybrid and mass spectrometry analyses
suggested that atg31 and atg17 form a protein complex.
to conﬁrm that atg31 indeed interacts with atg17, coim-
munoprecipitation experiments were performed. for the
biochemical analysis, we constructed cells that had chro-

ing that atg31 and atg17 interact. the amount of atg17

discussion
acknowledgments
this study demonstrates that the yeast atg31/cis1 pro-
tein plays a role in autophagy. atg31 functions with atg17
at the pas in order to form normal autophagosomes under
starvation conditions.
a recent study showed that atg17 acts as a scaﬀolding
protein to organize ap-atg proteins to the pas [9]. two-
hybrid assay [10], mass spectrometry analysis [11], and
coimmunoprecipitation demonstrate that atg31 forms a
complex with atg17 and suggest that atg31 functions
coordinately with atg17 at the pas. expectedly, defects
in the atg31d mutant are very similar to those of atg17d;
for example, in atg31d cells, autophagic bodies are not
accumulated in the vacuole, but prape1 is transported nor-
mally into the vacuole. furthermore, the atg31d mutant
also displays phenotypes common to mutant cells lacking
other ap-atg genes, including loss of viability under star-
vation conditions and defective sporulation [30]. atg31 is
not required for the dephosphorylation of atg13, atg8-
pe formation, or atg12–atg5 conjugation. these observa-
tions indicate that atg31 belongs to the same functional
unit as atg17.
it was shown previously that overexpressed cis1/atg31
restores the growth of cik1d cells at the restrictive temper-
ature [12]. however, the role of cis1/atg31 in karyogamy
remains to be elucidated. cik1 was reported to localize to
cytoplasmic microtubules and spindle pole bodies in a
kar3-dependent manner [13,14]. cis1/atg31 was predicted
to share this localization. however, atg31-gfp did not
colocalize with spc42-rfp, a marker protein for spindle
pole bodies (our unpublished results). instead, we showed
that atg31 locates to the pas. we have also shown that
cik1 and kar3 are dispensable for autophagy (our unpub-
lished results). in addition, any other ap-atg proteins are
not required for karyogamy. these data support a role for
atg31 in autophagy rather than karyogamy and mitosis.
loss of atg17 abolishes the pas localization of most
ap-atg proteins [9]. atg31 is primarily located to the
pas and requires atg17 for correct localization. similarly,
several ap-atg proteins failed to target to the pas in
atg31d mutant cells (our unpublished results), suggesting
that atg31 and atg17 coordinately play a role in the
recruitment of ap-atg proteins to the pas as a scaﬀolding
protein complex.
in addition to atg31, atg17 interacts with atg29 [29].
because atg29 is required for the formation of autophago-
somes, but not cvt vesicles [29], we speculate that atg31
and atg29 cooperate to orchestrate pas organization via
interaction with atg17, or that atg31 forms a complex
with atg29 through atg17. considering that atg17 is the
most upstream component of pas organization in our
hierarchy map [9], it is an attractive idea that atg31 func-
tions in pas organization as well as atg17. further analy-
sis of
these proteins is needed to provide additional
information about the mechanism of pas organization
and autophagosome formation.
