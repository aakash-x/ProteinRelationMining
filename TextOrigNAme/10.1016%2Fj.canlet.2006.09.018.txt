abstract
the eﬃcacy of onconase on the growth of a panel of chemosensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma cell lines was
investigated. onconase decreased cell viability of chemosensitive (imr-32, ukf-nb-3) and chemoresistant neuroblasto-
ma cell lines characterised by high expression of p-glycoprotein (p-gp) (ukf-nb-3rdox20) or by high p-gp expression in
combination with mutated p53 (ukf-nb-3rvcr10, be(2)-c), in a similar manner. moreover, onconase caused cell cycle
block in g1 phase and induced caspase-independent cell death. transmission electron microscope investigations suggested
that onconase-induced autophagy contributes to onconase-induced cell death. antitumour activity of onconase against
naı¨ve and drug-resistant neuroblastoma xenografts was conﬁrmed in animals.

1. introduction
onconase (ranpirnase) is a 12 kda homologue
of pancreatic rnase a, isolated from oocytes of
the northern leopard frog (rana pipiens) [1] that
exerts anti-proliferative and cytotoxic eﬀects in vitro
[2–5] and in vivo [2,3,6,7]. onconase showed in vitro
synergy with diﬀerent anti-cancer therapeutics [8–

13]. clinical
investigations revealed a favourable
toxicology proﬁle for onconase [14] that is currently
under investigation in phase iii clinical trials for the
treatment of malignant mesothelioma [14].
the anti-cancer mechanisms of onconase are not
yet fully understood. after binding to membrane
receptors, it is internalised by endocytosis [15,16]
and directed to the cytosol [17]. onconase was sug-
gested to degrade trna resulting in inhibition of
protein synthesis [18,19], to induce apoptosis by
induction of caspases and serine proteases [4,20],
and/or to act as an intracellular catalyst for the

generation of interfering rnas [21]. taken together,
the anti-cancer mechanism appears to be diﬀerent
from that of the conventional cytotoxic drugs.
neuroblastoma cells often acquire resistance to
cytotoxic drugs during therapy [22,23]. here, we
investigated the inﬂuence of onconase on growth
and viability of neuroblastoma cells including drug
resistant cell
lines and determined the eﬀect of
onconase on growth of neuroblastoma xenografts
in athymic nude mice.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
onconase was a kind gift from alfacell corporation
(bloomﬁeld, nj, usa). solutions of vincristine (sigma–
aldrich, deisenhofen, germany) and doxorubicin (cell
pharm, hannover, germany) were prepared in accor-
dance to the manufacturer’s instructions. the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-vad-fmk was received from merck biosci-
ences (schwalbach, germany), the pan-caspase inhibitor
apoptame f was obtained from mp biomedicals (stras-
bourg, france).
2.2. cells
the cell line ukf-nb-3 and its sub-lines adapted to
the growth in the presence of 20 ng/ml doxorubicin
(ukf-nb-3rdox20) or to the growth in the presence of
10 ng/ml vincristine (ukf-nb-3rvcr10) were established
as described [24]. the cell line ukf-nb-2 was established
as described [25]. sub-lines adapted to the growth in the
presence 20 ng/ml doxorubicin (ukf-nb-2rdox20) or
to the growth in the presence of 10 ng/ml vincristine
(ukf-nb-2rvcr10) were established by described meth-
ods [25]. the cell
line ukf-nb-4 was established as
described [26]. imr-32 cells, be(2)-c, sk-n-sh, and
sh-sy5y, were obtained from atcc (manassass, va,
usa). all cell lines were propagated in imdm supple-
mented with 10% fbs, 100 iu/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °c. all cell lines except
sk-n-sh [27] and its sub-clone sh-sy5y [28] show
n-myc ampliﬁcation.
p-glycoprotein (p-gp) belongs to the so-called abc
transporters that reduce intracellular drug accumulation
[29]. ukf-nb-3 [24], ukf-nb-2 [25], and imr-32 [26]
cells do not overexpress p-gp. in contrast, cell
lines
be(2)-c [30], ukf-nb-3rvcr10 [24], ukf-nb-3rdox20
[24], ukf-nb-2rvcr10 (data not shown), ukf-nb-
2rdox20 (data not shown), ukf-nb-4 [26], and sk-n-
sh [26,31] express high amounts of p-gp. ukf-nb-3
[24], ukf-nb-3rdox20
[24], ukf-nb-2 (data not
shown), ukf-nb-2rvcr10 (data not shown), ukf-
nb-2rdox20 (data not shown) imr-32 [32,33], sk-n-
sh [34], and sh-sy5y [35] cells express wild-type p53,
ukf-nb-3rvcr10 [24], ukf-nb-4 (data not shown),
and be(2)-c [36] cells carry p53 mutations. qualitative
information about p-gp, p53, and n-myc status are given
in table 1.
2.3. mtt assay
cell viability was investigated using the mtt assay
[37]. the procedure was modiﬁed and performed as
described before [38].
2.4. measurement of cellular dna content
the cell cycle was determined using a commercial kit
(bd biosciences, heidelberg, germany) following the
manufacturer’s instructions as described before [39].
the cellular dna also reveals a cellular fraction char-
acterised by a decreased dna content compared to cells
in g0/g1 phase (‘‘sub-g1’’ cell subpopulation). these
cells with fractional dna content are commonly regarded
as apoptotic cells [39].
2.5. cytochrome c release
the cytochrome c release in apoptotic cells was detected
by the method of waterhouse and trapani
[40] as
desribed before [41]. cells were harvested, washed with
cold pbs, pelleted, and permeabilised (perm/wash buﬀer,
bd biosciences, heidelberg, germany) so that cyto-
chrome c released from mitochondria in apoptotic cells
could be washed away. upon ﬁxation with 4% formalde-
hyde, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with blocking buﬀer (3% bsa perm/wash buﬀer), fol-
lowed by incubation overnight at 4 °c with primary
anti-cytochrome c antibody (6h2.b4, bd pharmingen,
heidelberg, germany). after incubation with secondary
fitc-labeled anti-mouse antibody for 40 min on ice,
the percentage of non-apoptotic cells containing mito-
chondrial cytochrome c was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry.
2.6. caspase activation
caspase activity was quantiﬁed using the caspase
fluorometric protease assay kit (biovision, heidelberg,
germany), according to the supplier’s protocol. the assay
is based on cleavage of
the ﬂuorogenic peptides
ac-lehd-afc (casp-9) and ac-devd-afc (casp-3),
which are added to cell lysates prepared from apoptotic
cells and non-apoptotic controls.
in addition, active caspases were determined by ﬂow
cytometry using apostat (r&d systems, wiesbaden,
germany) a ﬂuorescein-coupled pan-caspase inhibitor
that speciﬁcally binds to active caspases.

cells were processed for ultrastructural analysis as
described previously [42]. brieﬂy, cells were pelleted
and ﬁxed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, postﬁxed in 1%
osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embed-
ded in durupan-epon. thin sections were contrasted
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed with
a jeol jem, 2000 cx electron microscope (arishima,
japan).
2.8. xenograft tumours
female nude mice (cd-1 strain, anlab s.r.o., charles
river) weighing 18 to 20 g were s.c. transplanted with
5 · 106 ukf-nb-3 or ukf-nb-3rvcr10 cells, respec-
tively, together with matrigel (bd biosciences, heidel-
berg, germany)
into the right ﬂank. when tumors
reached a size of about 100 mm3, mice were divided in
groups of
three animals. ukf-nb-3 or ukf-nb-
3rvcr10 xenograft bearing mice were treated with vincris-
tine 0.5 mg/kg at day 1 to determine the in vivo-sensitivity
to vincristine, or with onconase 25 lg/kg mg/kg at day 1,
4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. control animals were treated
with pbs. the experiments were ﬁnished at day 30.
tumour volumes were determined every 3rd to 4th day
using a calliper. the tumour volumes were calculated by
the formula volume = length · width2/2.
2.9. statistics
results are the mean ± sd of at least three experi-
ments. comparisons between two groups were performed
using student’s t-test, three and more groups were com-
pared by anova followed by the student–newman–
keuls test. p values lower than 0.05 were considered to
be signiﬁcant.
3.1. onconase reduces cell viability of naı¨ve and drug-
resistant neuroblastoma cells
showed
onconase decreased the viability of ukf-nb-3 cells in
a dose- and time-dependent manner as shown by the mtt
assay. onconase

decrease in ukf-nb-3 cell viability after a 3-day incuba-
tion period, with ic50 of 3.09 ± 0.21 lg/ml. ic50-value
after 5 d of incubation was 1.20 ± 0.46 lg/ml, and after
7d incubation  0.23 ± 0.11 lg/ml. the ic50-values of all
tested cell lines after a 5-day incubation period are pre-
sented in table 1. onconase decreased the viability of
all neuroblastoma cell lines tested in a similar manner,
regardless of their sensitivity to vincristine, and doxorubi-
cin, of their n-myc status, of p-gp expression or of their
p53 status.
3.2. onconase induces cell cycle arrest and increases the
sub-g1 fraction in neuroblastoma cells
since the mtt assay does not discriminate between
cytotoxic and growth inhibitory eﬀects, we investigated
the eﬀect of onconase on neuroblastoma cell cycle.
treatment with onconase 1 lg/ml or onconase 10 lg/ml
of ukf-nb-3 cells, ukf-nb-3rvcr10, or ukf-nb-
3rdox20 for 48 h resulted in an accumulation of cells
in g0/g1-phase, with reciprocal reduction of cells in
the s-phase,
indicating cell cycle block in g1 phase.

induces an increase of propidium iodide-stained (dead)
cells (fig. 2b) conﬁrming toxic eﬀects indicated by sub-
g1 fraction.
3.3. onconase-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells is
caspase-independent
the increase of the sub-g1 fraction in onconase-treated
cells may indicate caspase-dependent apoptosis. apoptosis
may be executed by the extrinsic or the intrinsic apoptosis
pathways [43]. however, neuroblastoma cells from malig-
nant, disseminated disease are frequently insensitive to
extrinsic apoptosis induction by death-inducing ligands
(fasl, tumor necrosis factor a (tnf-a), tnf-a-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (trail)) due to deletion or
suppression of the proapoptotic enzyme caspase 8 [44–
47]. in our experiments, neither fasl (100 ng/ml) nor
tnf-a (100 ng/ml) or trail (100 ng/ml) reduced cell
viability of ukf-nb-3, ukf-nb-3rvcr10, or ukf-
nb-3rdox20 cells after 72 h incubation time (data not
shown). this shows that these cell lines were insensitive
to extrinsic apoptosis and onconase did not induce cell
death via extrinsic apoptosis induction in these cells.
during intrinsic apoptosis cytochrome c is released
from the mitochondria, forms with apoptotic protease acti-
vating factor 1 (apaf-1) and procaspase-9 the apoptosome
leading to cleavage/activation of eﬀector caspases (e.g.,
caspase 3) and in turn to the execution of programmed cell

death [43]. however, the mitochondrial pathway may be
not functional in neuroblastoma cells due to overexpres-
sion of bcl-2 that increases stability of the mitochondrial
membrane and inhibits cytochrome c release into the cyto-
sol [48]. onconase (10 lg/ml) treatment for 72 h failed to
induce cytochrome c release (fig. 3) or to activate initiator
caspase 9 (fig. 4a) or eﬀector caspase 3 (fig. 4b). in addi-
tion, no caspase activation could be detected by the use of a
ﬂuorescein-conjugated pan-caspase inhibitor speciﬁcally
recognising activated caspases (data not shown). in accor-
dance, the use of the pan-caspase inhibitors z-vad-fmk
or apoptame f did not inhibit onconase-induced cell death
(data not shown).
to obtain a hint on the mode of action by which
onconase induces cell death ukf-nb-3, ukf-nb-
3rvcr10, and ukf-nb-3rdox20 cells were treated with
onconase 10 lg/ml for 72 h and then analysed by electron
microscopy. the presence of numerous autophagosomes
in combination with the absence of chromatin condensa-
tion suggested that onconase-induced autophagic cell

3.4. onconase inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma
xenograft tumours
relative tumour volumes of ukf-nb-3 or ukf-nb-
3rvcr10 xenograft-bearing mice treated with onconase
or vincristine are shown in fig. 6. onconase did not sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀect mice body weights (data not shown).
ukf-nb-3 and ukf-nb-3rvcr20 xenograft-bearing
mice were treated with vincristine to determine if the
acquired in vitro resistance of parental cells to vincristine
is retained in tumor xenografts. indeed, ukf-nb-3 cells
were highly sensitive to a single injection of 0.5 mg/kg vin-
cristine at day 1. at day 1, when treatment was started,
tumour volumes of ukf-nb-3 xenograft-bearing animals
ranged from 113 to 250 mm3. at day 30 (end of treatment)
untreated (control) tumors ranged from 649 to 1293 mm3.
vincristine treatment resulted in two cases in complete
tumour regression. the remaining ﬁve tumours had vol-
umes between 124 and 379 mm3. to adequately compare
the tumour volumes in the diﬀerent treatment groups
tumour volumes were expressed in % relative to day 1.
at day 30, ukf-nb-3 control tumours had an average
volume of 601 ± 141%, whereas the ﬁve non-regressed
vincristine-treated ukf-nb-3 tumours had an average
tumour volume of 180 ± 29%.
in contrast, growth of ukf-nb-3rvcr20 xenografts
was not inﬂuenced by vincristine treatment. baseline vol-
ume of ukf-nb-3rvcr20 ranged between 113 and
250 mm3. at day 30, ukf-nb-3rvcr20 tumour volumes
ranged between 1912 and 5720 mm3 and volumes of vin-
cristine-treated ukf-nb-3rvcr20 xenografts
ranged
from 2080 to 3899 mm3. relative tumour volumes were
the non-treated ukf-nb-3rvcr20
2294 ± 851% for
xenografts and 2041 ± 638% for the vincristine-treated
ukf-nb-3rvcr20 xenografts at day 30.

onconase inhibited growth of both ukf-nb-3 and
ukf-nb-3rvcr20 xenografts. at the end of treatment
period onconase-treated ukf-nb-3 tumour volumes
ranged between 192 and 791 mm3, which was more than
twofold smaller than ukf-nb-3 controls (average rela-
tive tumour volume 273 ± 101%). treatment of ukf-
nb-3rvcr20 xenografts with onconase caused a more
than threefold growth inhibition: at day 30 tumour vol-
umes varied between 522 and 1390 mm3; average relative
tumour volumes of 627 ± 148%).
4. discussion
in this report, onconase was demonstrated to
inhibit growth and exert cytotoxic eﬀects against
drug-sensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma
cells in vitro and in vivo.
high expression of the drug transporter p-gp and
consequently decreased cellular accumulation of a
wide range of anti-cancer drugs, and mutation of
p53, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis are among
the most important mechanisms, contributing to
multi-drug-resistance phenotype
[29]. onconase
decreased viability of all neuroblastoma cell lines
independently of p-gp expression, p53 status or
n-myc status at ic50 range from 0.99 to 1.76 lg/ml,
which is signiﬁcantly lower than for most cancer cell
lines tested previously [4,9,10,13,15,17,19,20,49,50].
onconase-induced cell cycle block in g1/s-phase
observed in ukf-nb-3 cells, ukf-nb-3rvcr10,
and ukf-nb-3rdox20 cells after 48 h of treatment
is in concordance with previous ﬁndings showing that
cell cycle inhibitory eﬀects become usually apparent
after 48 to 96 h of onconase treatment [13,49,51,52].
onconase was shown to exert its cytotoxic eﬀects
via induction of apoptosis [4,51,53]. however, we
did not ﬁnd any evidence of caspase activation.
no cytochrome c release from mitochondria, activa-
tion of caspases, or inhibition of onconase-induced
cytotoxicity by two diﬀerent pan-caspase inhibitors
was observed, suggesting that onconase induces cell
death in the observed cell lines by a caspase-inde-
pendent mechanism. in concordance, caspase-inde-
pendent cell death has already been described for
neuroblastoma cells under diﬀerent circumstances
[54–56]. electron microscopic analysis of neuroblas-
toma cells revealed the presence of autophagosomes
and absence of chromatin condensation in oncon-
ase-treated cells. these are typical signs of autopha-
gic cell death [57]
suggesting that autophagy
contributed to onconase-induced cell death in neu-
roblastoma cells.
finally, we investigated the inﬂuence of onconase
on neuroblastoma cell growth in vivo in the xenograft
model in athymic nude mice. vincristine treatment
demonstrated that ukf-nb-3rvcr10 cells but not
parental ukf-nb-3
vincristine-
resistant in vivo. onconase treatment of mice bearing
xenografts of
line
the parental ukf-nb-3 cell
cells were
114
m. michaelis et al. / cancer letters 250 (2007) 107–116
resulted in about twofold decrease in the relative
tumour volumes. compared to ukf-nb-3 xeno-
grafts, ukf-nb-3rvcr10 tumours grew faster and
formed bigger tumours during the observation period.
onconase inhibited growth of ukf-nb-3rvcr10
tumours by threefold. the diﬀerences in the extent
of growth inhibition between ukf-nb-3 and
ukf-nb-3rvcr10 tumours may be explained by a
higher sensitivity to cytotoxic/cytostatic treatment
of the faster growing ukf-nb-3rvcr10 tumours.
therefore, our in vitro and in vivo data demon-
strate that onconase inhibits neuroblastoma cell
growth and induces caspase-independent cell death
in neuroblastoma cells independently of p-gp expres-
sion or p53 status. similar eﬀective concentrations
were required to kill chemosensitive neuroblastoma
cell
lines (ukf-nb-3, imr-32), p-gp expressing
cell line ukf-nb-3rdox20, and p-gp expressing cell
lines harbouring a p53 mutation (ukf-nb-
3rvcr10, be(2)-c). these results are partly in accor-
dance with previous ﬁndings [10]. ht-29 cells
expressing p-gp induced by transfection were simi-
larly sensitive to onconase as non-transfected ht-
29 cells in vitro [10]. however, although onconase
restored vincristine sensitivity of p-gp-expressing
ht-29 cells in vivo, onconase alone did not prolong
the life-time of mice bearing these tumours [10]. in
contrast, our data show that onconase treatment
inhibits growth of vincristin-resistant neuroblasto-
ma xenografts (ukf-nb-3rvcr10).
taken together,
the anti-cancer activity of
onconase against chemosensitive and multi-drug
resistant neuroblastoma cell lines in relatively low
concentrations compared to those eﬀective in cell
lines from other cancer types encourages its further
investigation against neuroblastoma.
