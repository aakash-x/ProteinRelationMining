dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) ii (e.c. 3.4.14.2) is an intracellular protease that releases, pre-
ferably at acidic ph, n-terminal dipeptides from oligopeptides with pro or ala in the
penultimate position. the natural substrates and the physiological role of dppii remain
unclear. the aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of dppii activity in
different forms of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy) in human leukocytes. we
determined speciﬁc dpp activities in leukocytes. compared to other subpopulations of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), we observed relatively high dppii speciﬁc
activity in monocytic cells, opening new perspectives for further investigation of the dppii
functions. a second intriguing ﬁnding was that dppii speciﬁc activity increased during
necrosis, whereas induction of apoptosis or autophagy did not affect any of the dipeptidyl
peptidase activities. finally, we showed that inhibition of dppii (>90%) using the in vitro
applicable, highly potent (ki of 0.082  0.048 nm) and selective dppii inhibitor uamc00039,
did not induce any form of cell death in leukocytes. these data are of importance for a more
precise interpretation of the in vitro and in vivo effects of other dipeptidyl peptidase
inhibitors.

introduction
dipeptidyl peptidase ii (dppii, e.c. 3.4.14.2) is an intracellular
protease that localizes to the vesicular system. it releases,
preferably at acidic ph, n-terminal dipeptides from oligopep-
tides with pro or ala in the penultimate position. according to
cytochemical studies, dppii is found in normal as well as in a
number of malignant haematological cells. it is present in both
t and b lymphocytes, the former usually showing a stronger
cytochemical signal [1–3]. assessment of the number of dppii

positive lymphocytes represents a simple and reliable prog-
nostic criterion in patients with b type chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (b-cll) [4,5]. patients with b-cll displaying a high
number of dppii positive cells had a worse prognosis [1].
recently, susceptibility to the dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitor
val-boro-pro (vbp)-induced apoptosis of cll b cells was
suggested to be a novel prognostic factor in cll [6]. moreover,
the ratio of serum dppii versus dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dppiv)
activity has been proposed as a biochemical index of cancer [7–
9]. despite recent investigations on possible peptide sub-
strates and in vivo function of dppii, the natural substrates
and the physiological role remain undeﬁned [10,11]. among
the dipeptidyl peptidases able to cleave post-proline bonds,
dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dppiv) has been studied most
extensively [12]. the human ﬁbroblast activation protein a
(fapa) shares the highest sequence homology with dppiv and
bears both dppiv-like and collagenase/gelatinase activity but
is not expressed in most normal adult tissues [13].
in 1999, chiravuri et al. observed that inhibitors of post-
proline cleaving dipeptidyl peptidases such as vbp caused
apoptosis in quiescent lymphocytes in a process independent
of dppiv [14]. the effect was attributed to the enzyme human
quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (qpp). later qpp and dppii
were proven to be identical [15–17], suggesting a possible role
for dppii in cell death. however, the discovery of some new
members of the dppiv family, such as dpp8 and dpp9 made us
look at the selectivity of dpp inhibitors from a different
perspective. previous studies using these compounds require
reinterpretation. the dpp inhibitor vbp, also known as
talabostat or pt-100, has great therapeutic potential. four
phase ii studies are ongoing in cancer patients, and talabostat
is also under development for the treatment of hematopoietic
disordes, such as neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytope-
nia. the hematopoietic target in these studies was identiﬁed
as ﬁbroblast activation protein a (fapa) [18,19].
since the dpps are similar with respect to their catalytic
mechanism and substrate selectivity, the development of
potent and selective dppii-inhibitors is a challenging task. the
highly potent and selective dppii-inhibitor n-(4-chlorobenzyl)-
4-oxo-4-(1-piperidinyl)-1,3-(s)-butane-diamine dihydrochlor-
ide (uamc00039) [20] proved to be a useful tool for in vivo
investigations [11]. uamc00039 demonstrated in vivo efﬁcacy
and oral availability without evidence for acute toxicity. the
high selectivity of the inhibitor enabled us to differentiate
between dppii and dppiv/8/9 activities in biological systems.
therefore, this compound seemed to be an excellent tool for
the investigation of dppii activity during different forms of cell
death.
in vitro and in vivo model systems support the
hypothesis that a variety of cell death programs may be
triggered in distinct circumstances. there is growing evidence
that besides apoptosis, autophagic and necrotic forms of cell
degeneration may be programmed [21]. the aim of the present
study was to investigate the involvement of dppii activity in
cell death (apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy) of human
leukocytes. first, the speciﬁc dppii activity was determined in
different subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmc). secondly, dppii speciﬁc activity was assessed
during cell proliferation and after induction of different types
of cell death. thirdly, we studied whether uamc00039 was
able to inhibit intracellular dppii in cell culture and whether
inhibition of dppii induced cell death. to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study addressing the inﬂuence of
various forms of cell death on speciﬁc dppii activity.

methylaminocarbonyl]phenyl} 1-((s)-prolyl)pyrrolidine-2(r,s)-
phosphonate (ab207) were synthesised as described [12,20,22].
dppii and dppiv were puriﬁed from human seminal plasma
[17,23]. the dpp activity in cell homogenates after the removal
of dppii and dppiv by afﬁnity chromatography was considered
to be dpp activity not caused by dppii or dppiv. dpp activity
presumably caused by dpp8, dpp9 and dppiv is termed ‘non-
dppii’ dpp activity (dppiv/8/9). buffy coats were obtained from
the antwerp blood transfusion center. all cell culture products
including pbs, rpmi 1640 medium, earle’s balanced salt
solution (ebss), foetal bovine serum (fbs), penicillin and
streptomycin were obtained from invitrogen. ficoll-paque
plus was from amersham biosciences. mg-132, nigericine and
2-chloro-20-deoxyadenosine (cda) were obtained from cal-
biochem. annexin v-fitc and propidium iodide (pi) were
purchased from bd biosciences. cell lines (jurkat, hl60, u937)
were obtained from the american type culture collection.
lys-ala-p-nitroanilide (lys-ala-pna), ala-pro-pna and gly-
pro-pna were obtained from bachem. phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (pma), etoposide, bovine serum albumin (bsa) and
cacodylic acid were from sigma. all other chemicals were
obtained from icn biomedicals.
2.2.
cells
the human monocytic cell line u937 was grown in rpmi 1640
medium supplemented with 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fbs at 37 8c in 5%
co2/95% air. to induce monocytic cell differentiation,
u937 cells (0.25  106 ml 1) were cultured in the presence of
fig. 1 – structure of the dppii inhibitor uamc00039. the
dppii inhibitor n-(4-chlorobenzyl)-4-oxo-4-(1-piperidinyl)-

10 ng/ml pma for 72 and 96 h. cells were scraped with a rubber
policeman. human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmc) were isolated by ficoll-paque density gradient cen-
trifugation of buffy coats, washed three times in rpmi and
incubated overnight in complete medium at 37 8c in 5% co2/
95% air before use. we used the non-adherent cells (pre-
dominantly lymphocytes) in our experiments, unless stated
otherwise. for the isolation (positive selection) of peripheral
cd4+, cd19+ and cd14+ cells, the non-adherent pbmc were
incubated with dynabeads cd4 (t helper/inducer) and
dynabeads cd19 (panb) and the adherent cells with dyna-
beads cd14 (monocytes/macrophages) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (dynal biotech asa, oslo, nor-
way). cells were lysed (vide infra) while attached to the beads.
assays were conducted in rpmi without fbs unless stated
otherwise.
enzyme activity and protein content were determined after
lysing the cells. washed cells were suspended (1–
10  106 cells/100 ml)
(1% octylglucoside in
0.05 m cacodylic acid–naoh buffer ph 5.5, 10 mm edta,
70 mg/ml aprotinin), incubated for 1 h at 4 8c and centrifuged
for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (4 8c). the resulting supernatant was
used as cell lysate.
in lysisbuffer
cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting (neubauer-
improved counting chamber) and protein measurements.
protein content was determined according to bradford [24] or
by using the bicinchoninic acid (bca) protein assay kit (pierce,
usa) with bsa as a standard.
2.3.
enzyme assays
enzyme activities were determined kinetically for 10 minutes
at 37 8c by measuring the initial velocities of p-nitroaniline
release (405 nm) from the substrate using a spectramax plus
microtiterplate reader (molecular devices). one unit of enzyme
activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that catalyses
the release of 1 mmol p-nitroaniline from the substrate per
minute under assay conditions. dppii enzymatic activity was
determined using lys-ala-pna (1 mm) in 0.05 m cacodylic
acid–naoh buffer ph 5.5 containing 10 mm edta and 14 mg/ml
aprotinin [17]. analoguous to the enzyme assay of chiravuri
et al. for qpp [14], we also used 1 mm ala-pro-pna in 0.05 m
hepes buffer ph 7.0 containing 10 mm edta and 14 mg/ml
aprotinin. dppii, dppiv, dpp8 and dpp9 can all cleave ala-pro-
pna under these conditions [25,26]. ‘non-dppii’ dpp activity
(dppiv/8/9) was determined using 0.5 mm gly-pro-pna in
0.05 m tris buffer ph 8.3 containing 10 mm edta and 14 mg/ml
aprotinin.
2.4.
inhibitor characterization
inhibition of dppii activity was analysed spectrophotometri-
cally as described above except that the dppii inhibitor was
preincubated with the enzyme sample for 15 min at 37 8c prior
to the addition of substrate. ic50 values were obtained with
substrate concentrations near the km value and at least 10
different inhibitor concentrations were used. ic50 values were
calculated using graﬁt software [27]. to investigate the
selectivity of the inhibitor, ic50-values for puriﬁed dppiv
and dpp8/9 were also measured.
the inhibition constant of the inhibitor for the active site
(ki) was determined using seven different substrate concen-
trations (10–1000 mm ala-pro-pna) and at least ten different
inhibitor concentrations (0–50 nm). per substrate concentra-
tion, the data were ﬁtted to the equation for tight-binding
inhibition (eq. (1)) [28] using grafit version 5 [27] to calculate
the ki-app.

inhibition constant. the different ki-app were plotted against
their associated substrate concentration and the ki was deter-
mined by calculating the intercept with the y-axis using grafit
version 5 [27]. all experiments were performed in triplicate.
the reversibility of dppii inhibition by uamc00039 was
investigated kinetically for 30 min under pseudo-ﬁrst order
conditions at 37 8c (5 nm uamc00039 ﬁnal concentration in
200 ml reaction volume). in a ﬁrst experiment, the reaction was
started by adding 190 ml of 1 mm ala-pro-pna to 10 ml of a
preincubated (15 min) mixture of 100 nm inhibitor and
enzyme. in a second experiment, the reaction was started
by adding 5 ml of enzyme to 195 ml of a mixture of inhibitor and
1 mm ala-pro-pna. both progress curves were compared.
2.5.
inhibition of intracellular dppii
stability of uamc00039 in rpmi medium or assay buffer
(50 mm cacodylate buffer ph5.5) was monitored at 37 8c. the
inhibitors’ capacity (ic50) to inhibit dppii was measured at
different time points (up to 48 h).
u937 cells were incubated with various concentrations of
inhibitor for 15 min at 37 8c in rpmi. cells were then washed
with pbs, lysed and assayed for dppii activity; ic50 values were
calculated as described above. concentration–response and
time–response curves were generated from incubations of
pbmc with uamc00039 (0.01 nm–1 mm) in rpmi at 37 8c for 1, 5,
15, 30 and 60 min. washed cells were lysed overnight at 4 8c
using 100 mm hepes buffer ph 7.4, 10 mm edta, 70 mg/ml
aprotinin and 1% octylglucoside.
2.6.
cell death induction and measurement
u937 cells or pbmc (0.5  106 cells/ml) were treated with the
dppii inhibitor uamc00039 (1 and 100 mm), the dppiv/8/9
inhibitor ab207 (5 mm) and with different triggers of cell death
for 24 or 48 h at 37 8c in 5% co2/95% air. the topoisomerase ii-
inhibitor etoposide (50 mm) and the proteasome inhibitor
mg132 (10 mm) were used as positive controls for apoptosis
[29,30]. a 2-chloro-20-deoxyadenosine (cda, 10 mg/ml) was
used as an apoptosis trigger in resting pbmc (after 24 h of
incubation) [31,32]. the k+ ionophore nigericine (10 mm) was
used as a trigger for necrosis in the monocytic u937 cells [33].
cells underwent amino acid deprivation in ebss to induce
autophagy [34].

2.6.1. viability measurements
viability was assessed microscopically by trypan blue exclusion
(0.2% trypan blue in pbs) after culturing cells in the presence of
100 mm of inhibitor for up to 48 h. in addition, neutral red uptake
was evaluated. cells were incubated with fresh medium
containing neutral red (100 mg/ml). after 2 h, cultures were
washed twice with pbs and the neutral red in the cells was
extracted with 0.05 m na2hpo4 in 50% ethanol. neutral red
absorbance was detected at 540 nm. the viability was calculated
with regard to the untreated cell control, which was set to 100%.
2.6.2. annexin v/propidium iodide (pi) staining
phosphatidylserine expression was determined by ﬂow cyto-
metric analysis using annexin v-fitc. loss of membrane
integrity (necrosis) was assessed by using pi. after 2, 6 and 24 h
of incubation, cells were washed with pbs to remove non-
incorporated inhibitor, resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm
hepes ph 7.4, 140 mm nacl, 2.5 mm cacl2) and subsequently
labelled with annexin v-fitc. pi (ﬁnal concentration 8 mg/ml)
was added immediately prior to ﬂow cytometric analysis using
a facsort analytical ﬂow cytometer (bd biosciences, san
diego, ca). cells were classiﬁed into the following fractions:
viable cells (annexin v /pi ), apoptotic cells (annexin v+/pi )
and necrotic cells (annexin v+/pi+).
2.6.3. determination of apoptosis by dna fragmentation
assays
dna fragmentation into nucleosomal bands was detected
using agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously [35].
brieﬂy, cells were lysed with hypotonic lysisbuffer (10 mm
tris, 1 mm edta, 0.2% triton x-100). then 0.5 mg/ml
proteinase k was added and lysates were incubated for 1 h
at 50 8c. at the end of the incubation, 10 ml of dnase-free
rnase (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the lysates and the tubes were
incubated for 1 h at 37 8c. after precipitation overnight
( 20 8c) with 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 1 volume
of isopropanol, the pellets were air dried and dissolved in
water. after adding loading buffer (fermentas), dna samples
were analysed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained
with ethidium bromide.
electron microscopy
2.6.4.
cells were harvested and ﬁxed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate-
buffered (ph 7.4) 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, then rinsed
(3  10 min) in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate-buffered (ph 7.4) 7.5%
saccharose and postﬁxed in 1% oso4 solution for 1 h. after
dehydration in an ethanol gradient (70% ethanol [20 min], 96%
ethanol [20 min], 100% ethanol [2  20 min]), samples were
embedded in durcupan acm. ultrathin sections were stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. sections were examined
in a philips cm 10 microscope at 80 kv.
effect of cell death on speciﬁc dpp activity
2.6.5.
after 2, 6 and 24 h, dipeptidyl peptidase activities were
measured as described above. at the same time points
viability/cell death was investigated by annexin v/pi staining.
2.7.

results
3.1.
dppii activity in leukocyte subpopulations
the dpp activities in resting primary mononuclear cells
(adherent and non-adherent cells) and in several human
leukemia cell
lines (jurkat, u937, hl60) were compared
(fig. 2a). under our lysing conditions that were optimized
for the study of dppii, the monocytic u937 and hl60 cells
showed the highest dppii vs. ‘non-dppii’ dpp activity. in u937
cells, ‘non-dppii’ dpp activity balanced around the detection
limit. dppii activity in pma-stimulated u937 cells was
signiﬁcantly lower ( p < 0.05) than in the control cells both
after 72 and 96 h of incubation (fig. 2a right panel). among
primary lymphocytes, dppii activity was higher in t helper
cells (cd4+) than in b cells (cd19+) ( p = 0.001, fig. 2b). again,
monocytes (cd14+) showed relatively high dppii activity.
speciﬁc dpp activities were measured in u937 cells in
different cell culture conditions for 96 h. speciﬁc dppii activity
did not change in experiments with medium containing
serum and medium without serum. however, dppii speciﬁc
activity increased after 96 h of amino acid deprivation
(supplementary data). at this moment necrosis was observed.
3.2.
effect of cell death on dpp activities
the effect of different types of cell death on the speciﬁc dpp
activities in u937 cells and pbmc was investigated (fig. 3a)
fig. 4 – inhibition characteristics of uamc00039. (a) ki of
dppii inhibition by uamc00039. the different ki-app,
obtained using the equation for tight-binding inhibition
(eq. (1)) as described in section 2 were plotted against their
associated substrate concentration and the ki was
determined by calculating the intercept with the y-axis (ki
of 0.082 w 0.048 nm). the data represent the
mean w s.e.m. of three separate experiments. (b)
reversibility of dppii inhibition by uamc00039. the
reversibility of dppii inhibition by uamc00039 was
investigated as described in materials and methods using
5 nm inhibitor as final concentration. in a first experiment,
the reaction was started by adding substrate (ala-pro-
pna) to a mixture of preincubated uamc00039 and dppii
(~, lower curve, dissociation curve of the inhibitor–
enzyme complex). in a second experiment, the reaction
was started by adding enzyme to a mixture of inhibitor
and substrate (5, curve of inhibitor binding to the
enzyme). the slow recovery of the enzymatic activity, after
dilution of the pre-formed enzyme–inhibitor complex,
indicated that uamc00039 was a reversible dpp ii
inhibitor.
were assessed using one-way or univariate analysis of
variance (anova), followed by the dunnett test. a value
of p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. n represents the
number of experiments. an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-
test was used to analyze speciﬁc activities of fig. 3b and
d-ppii speciﬁc activities of th cells and b cells in fig. 2b.
linear regression analysis was carried out on the data shown
in fig. 4a.

using the cell death inducers etoposide, mg132 and amino acid
depletion (ebss). etoposide and mg132 caused apoptosis in
u937 cells within 6 h of incubation as demonstrated by
annexin v+/pi  staining. after 24 h, etoposide and mg132-
induced apoptosis evolved to secondary necrosis as demon-
strated by microscopy and annexin v+/pi+ staining. apoptosis
and amino acid depletion-induced autophagy did not affect
dppii or ‘non-dppii’ dpp activities. however, secondary
necrosis led to an increase of the dppii speciﬁc activity. pbmc
were quite resistant to the apoptosis triggers since apoptosis
was only observed after 24 h of incubation with etoposide or
mg132. apoptosis of pbmc did not affect dppii or ‘non-dppii’
dpp speciﬁc activities.
the increase in dppii speciﬁc activity during secondary
necrosis prompted us to evaluate dppii activity in u937 cells
after triggering necrosis. since 10 mm nigericine is known to
elicit necrosis in monocytic cell lines [33], its effect on dppii
activity was investigated in u937 cells. similar to secondary
necrosis, dppii speciﬁc activity increased 3.5-fold after 24 h
nigericine treatment, (fig. 3b).

inhibition characteristics of uamc00039
uamc00039 is a potent reversible competitive tight binding
dppii inhibitor with a ki of 0.082  0.048 nm (fig. 4). because
uamc00039 has a subnanomolar ic50 towards dppii compared
to an ic50 of more than 100 mm for ‘non-dppii’ dpp activity
present in leukocytes, the inhibitor shows high selectivity
towards dppii (table 1). the efﬁcacy of a dppii inhibitor in cell
culture depends not only on the inhibitors’ potency towards
the enzyme but also on its stability in the medium and its
ability to enter the cell. uamc00039 was stable for at least 48 h
at 37 8c in culture medium and in dppii assay buffer. the
compound was able to enter pbmc within 1 min resulting in a
fig. 6 – effects of dpp inhibitors on cell death parameters in u937 cells and pbmc. u937 cells and pbmc were incubated for 2,
6 and 24 h with the specific dppii inhibitor uamc00039 and the dppiv/8/9 inhibitor ab207. 50 mm etoposide was used as a
positive control for apoptosis. apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by annexin v/pi staining (n = 3). the data were
analysed using an univariate anova, followed by the dunnett test: ***p < 0.001 vs. control annexinv/pi staining.

inhibition of
concentration-dependent
intracellular dppii
activity without affecting the ‘non-dppii’ dpp activity
(fig. 5). maximal efﬁcacy was reached at 100 nm. upon
incubation of intact u937 cells with uamc00039, intracellular
dppii was inhibited with an ic50 in the same order of
magnitude as that of both the puriﬁed enzyme and dppii in
u937 cell lysates (supplementary data).

induction
to ensure that sufﬁcient inhibitor concentrations accumu-
lated in the dppii containing vesicles of u937 cells and pbmc, 1
and 100 mm uamc00039 were used in the cell death assays.
both concentrations of uamc00039 inhibited dppii activity of
pbmc and u937 cells more than 90%. although uamc00039 is a
reversible inhibitor (fig. 4b), dppii was inhibited over the
entire duration of the cell death assays due to the high
concentration and stability of the compound in medium.
trypan blue exclusion experiments
suggested that
uamc00039 concentrations up to 100 mm were non-toxic for
u937 cells for at least 48 h. based on neutral red uptake by
pbmc and u937 cells, inhibition of dppii or dppiv/8/9 did not
affect viability of the cells whereas neutral red uptake by
positive controls (treated with etoposide, mg132, cda) was
signiﬁcantly decreased (data not shown).
based on annexinv/pi staining (fig. 6) and dna laddering
experiments (supplementary data), inhibition of dppii (1 and
100 mm uamc00039) or dppiv/8/9 (5 mm ab207) did not result
in apoptosis or necrosis of u937 (n = 3) and pbmc (n = 3) cells
after 24 h of
incubation. concentrations up to 100 mm
uamc00039 did not affect mg132-triggered cell death.
transmission electron microscopic analysis of u937 cells
treated with the dppii inhibitor uamc00039 did not reveal
vacuolization, which is a marker of autophagy [21]. other
morphological differences between control and treated cells
could not be observed.
based on total protein and cell count, cell proliferation was
unaffected when dppii activity was inhibited (>90% inhibition)
for up to 96 h. we did not observe any upregulation of ‘non-
dppii’ dpp activity when dppii was inhibited (data not shown).

discussion
cellular dppiv-like enzymatic activity represents the sum of
the hydrolytic activities of several dppiv activity and/or
structure homologues (dash) including the plasma mem-
brane localized dppiv and fapa as well as the intracellular
proteases dppii, dpp8 and dpp9 [36]. experimental data on
dppii activity in different leukocytes and during the cell cycle
are scarce and primarily based on non-quantitative cyto-
chemical studies [1–3]. in this study, we focussed on the
involvement of dppii activity in leukocyte cell death. the
pbmc showed considerable interindividual variability in
enzyme activities and in addition resting lymphocytes were
quite resistant to the induction of apoptosis. therefore, in
addition to pbmc, we chose the monocytic u937 cells. we
could not observe any changes in the speciﬁc dppii activity
during proliferation of u937 cells which conﬁrms the sugges-
tion that dppii plays a role in cell differentiation, rather than in
cell proliferation [37–39]. however, dppii activity decreased
after pma-stimulation in the u937 cells.
based on intense cytochemical staining of dppii
in
transitional ameloblasts from decalciﬁed rat mandibles where
apoptosis is thought to occur, dppii has also been linked to cell
death [40]. furthermore, histochemical studies employing
ovaries from cycling rats localized dppii primarily to atretic
follicles and during pregnancy, when all developing follicles
are targeted for atresia, ovarian levels of dppii are some three-
to eight-fold higher [41]. however, the results of the present
study demonstrate that induction of apoptosis in u937 cells
had no effect on dppii speciﬁc activity.
autophagy, a nonapoptotic type of cell death, has been
described as a means to resist starvation by degrading
intracellular components for reuse. since dppii is known to
cleave short peptides such as tripeptides [10,41,42], it may also
be involved in the recycling of amino acids. moreover, dppii is
localized to acidic vesicles [43] and based on cytochemical
localization experiments in rat incisor tooth ameloblasts,
reaction products of dppii are present in phagosomes [40].
autophagy is characterized by formation of numerous acidic
vacuoles and therefore it is tempting to speculate that dppii is
involved in the breakdown of peptides in autophagosomes.
‘‘starvation’’ conditions are routinely used to trigger autop-
hagy. however, dppii activity did not increase during starva-
tion-induced autophagy of u937 cells. in the context of dppii’s
catabolic function, we also investigated whether inhibition of
the proteasome had an effect on dppii activity and whether
combined dppii and proteasome inhibition affected cell death
induction. yet, we demonstrated that dppii speciﬁc activity
only increased when apoptosis evolved to secondary necrosis.
in tissue culture, apoptotic cells can quickly proceed to
secondary necrosis in the absence of uptake by phagocytic
cells [44]. the increase in speciﬁc dppii activity was conﬁrmed
using nigericine as a trigger for necrosis in u937 cells. a
possible explanation for this observation may be that necrotic
cells, due to leaky membranes, have minimal protein content
[45].
according to chiravuri et al. inhibition of dppii activity by
the boronic acid derivative vbp causes apoptosis in quiescent
lymphocytes in a process independent of dppiv [14]. recent
counterscreening efforts demonstrated that the boronic acid
derivatives (e.g. vbp), initially designed as dppiv inhibitors
and also known to inhibit dppii and fap [19,46], in addition
potently inhibit dpp8 and dpp9 [47]. moreover, in another
study the nonselective vbp as well as a selective dpp8/9
inhibitor inhibited proliferation and il-2 release in t cells [48],
properties that were previously attributed to dppiv. dppii and
dppiv selective compounds had no effect in these assays. the
concentrations of vbp used by chiravuri at al. [14], largely
exceeded the nanomolar ic50’s of all dpps [47,48], which
raises the possibility that leukocyte apoptosis elicited by vbp
was not due to dppii/qpp inhibition. the conditions used for
measuring the qpp/dppii activity (ala-pro-afc ph 7.5) also
did not exclude involvement of the new dpp members dpp8
and/or 9.
the availability of a highly potent and selective dppii
inhibitor uamc00039 prompted us to further investigate the
possible role of dppii activity in different forms of cell death.
78
b i o c h e m i c a l p h a r m a c o l o g y 7 2 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 7 0 – 7 9
we showed that uamc00039 proved to be suitable for cell
culture experiments. the selectivity of this inhibitor enabled
us to differentiate between dppii and other related peptidases
in the cell. the ic50 for intracellular dppii in intact u937 cells
seemed even lower than the ic50 for puriﬁed dppii or dppii in
cell lysates. possibly the basic inhibitor is enriched in the
acidic vesicular compartment where dppii is located.
viability tests, dna laddering assays and annexin v/pi-
staining experiments showed that neither apoptosis nor
necrosis occurred in u937-cells and pbmc after incubation
with the dppii inhibitor. nonetheless, dppii activity was
inhibited for >90%. as reported in literature, resting lympho-
cytes showed a low sensitivity to the different apoptotic
triggers [49–51].
at present, there is a lack of good markers for biochemical
detection of autophagy. a growing body of evidence indicates
that mammalian microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
3 (lc3), in particular endogenous levels of the processed form
lc3-ii, is a biomarker for autophagy because it functions as a
structural component during autophagosome formation.
however, due to low expression levels of the protein, lc3
immunoblotting could not be used for u937 cells [52].
transmission electron microscopy, currently the ‘‘golden
standard’’ for monitoring autophagy both in tissue and
cultured cells [53], did not reveal signs of autophagy in
uamc00039 treated u937 cells. in conclusion, our results
clearly demonstrate (1) that inhibition of dppii catalytic
activity did not induce apoptosis, autophagy or necrosis in
human leukocytes and (2) that dppii speciﬁc activity increased
during necrosis, but not during apoptosis or autophagy.
