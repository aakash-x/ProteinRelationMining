abstract autophagy is a degradation process accompanied by
dynamic membrane organization. in the yeast, saccharomyces
cerevisiae, about 30 atg (autophagy-related) genes have been
identiﬁed as important genes for autophagy. among them, 17
are indispensable for formation of the autophagosome, an orga-
nelle enclosed by a double lipid bilayer during starvation-induced
autophagy. recently, a central structure for autophagosome gen-
eration, termed the pre-autophagosomal structure, was identi-
ﬁed. despite intensive study, many questions regarding the
mechanisms underlying autophagosome formation remain unan-
swered. in this review, we will give an overview of recent studies
on the mechanisms of autophagosome formation and discuss
these unresolved questions.

1. introduction
cellular homeostasis is balanced between the synthesis and
degradation of proteins, nucleic acids, ribosomes, and organ-
elles. the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a selective protein
degradation pathway. in contrast, macroautophagy, hereafter
referred to as autophagy, is a major pathway of bulk and
non-selective degradation. in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevi-
siae, autophagy has been studied as a cellular response for sur-
vival during nutrient-limited conditions [1]. recent studies have
shown that during nutrient-rich growth, autophagy contributes
to the transport of vacuolar hydrolases to the vacuolar lumen in
yeast [2], and the clearance of protein aggregates and defense
against invasion of viruses or bacteria in mammalian cells [3].
moreover, autophagy has a role in anti-aging in plants [4].

breakdown of the autophagic system has maladaptive and of-
ten fatal pathological eﬀects in higher eukaryotes; protein fold-
ing diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and neonatal death
immediately after birth have been associated with defective
autophagy [3]. this process is required for development and
diﬀerentiation in yeasts, slime molds, nematodes, and ﬂies; that
is, autophagy is required for remodeling of cells accompanied
with bulk degradation of cellular components [5]. thus, recent
studies have revealed several aspects of cellular processes
involving autophagy during vegetative growth conditions.
2. process of autophagy
because autophagy is dramatically activated in such severe
environments to adapt and survive, the process of autophagy
long has been studied under nutrient-limited conditions. here-
after, we mainly focus on autophagy that has been described in
the yeast s. cerevisiae exposed to nutrient-starvation condi-
tions. recent studies have revealed that autophagy proceeds
through the following steps (fig. 1): (i) detection of starvation
signals; (ii) transmission of these signals to the autophago-
some-generating apparatus known as the pre-autophagosomal
structure (pas); (iii) generation of an isolation membrane
(im) from the pas; (iv) expansion of the im; (v) fusion of
the leading edges of the im to complete autophagosome for-
mation; (vi) fusion of the outer membrane of the autophago-
some with the vacuolar membrane and subsequent release of
autophagic bodies, whose membranes are derived from the in-
ner membrane of the autophagosome; (vii) disintegration of
the autophagic body and degradation of the contents by vacu-
olar hydrolases; and (viii) transport of the resulting amino
acids and lipids to the cytoplasm for recycling.
starvation signals are sensed and transmitted to the tor sig-
naling pathway, which is one of the master regulators of cell
growth [6]. during vegetative growth, tor kinase is active, and
it phosphorylates several downstream proteins. when tor ki-
nase is inactivated by nutrient limitation or treatment with rap-
amycin, several cellular responses, including autophagy, are
induced. this response results in autophagosome formation.
3. autophagosome
the autophagosome in the yeast s. cerevisiae is encircled by
double lipid bilayers and is about 400–900 nm in diameter [7].

fig. 1. autophagy in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. autophagy proceeds through the following steps: (i) sensation of starvation signals; (ii)
transmission of these signals to the autophagosome-generating machinery known as the pas (pre-autophagosomal structure); (iii) generation of an
isolation membrane (im) from the pas; (iv) expansion of the im; (v) fusion of the leading edges of the im to complete autophagosome formation;
(vi) fusion of the outer membrane of the autophagosome with the vacuolar membrane and subsequent release of autophagic bodies, whose membrane
is derived from the inner membrane of the autophagosome; (vii) disintegration of the autophagic body and degradation of its contents by vacuolar
hydrolases; and (viii) transport of the resulting amino acids and lipids to the cytoplasm for recycling.
the autophagosomal membrane is rich in lipids and poor in
proteins [8], and is much larger than typical secretory vesicles,
suggesting that it is composed of the minimal components nec-
essary to load the maximum material destined to be degraded.
the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vac-
uolar membrane by using general fusion machinery [9]. the
autophagic body, the structure surrounded by the inner lipid
bilayer, is released into the lumen of the vacuole [7]. conse-
quently, the autophagic body is degraded by vacuolar hydro-
lases.
interestingly, the machinery employed in autophagosome
formation is common to that in a biosynthetic pathway under
vegetative growth conditions. this pathway, called the cyto-
plasm-to-vacuole targeting (cvt) pathway, delivers a few vac-
uolar hydrolases to the vacuole in about 150-nm vesicles,
named cvt vesicles, which are also composed of double lipid
bilayers. aminopeptidase i (ape1) [10] and a-mannosidase
[11] are among the proteins transported by the cvt pathway.
ape1 forms dodecamers [12], which are organized into large
complexes that are about 150 nm in diameter; ultimately, this
complex is enwrapped by a cvt vesicle and delivered to the
vacuole [2].
[10]. interestingly, these groups of genes showed considerable
overlap [14]. moreover, other types of autophagy have been
described by several groups, and the genes involved in each
of these types had been named independently: gsa (glucose-
induced selective autophagy) [15], paz (pexophagy zeocin-
resistant) [16] and pdd (peroxisome degradation-deﬁcient)
[17]. to avoid confusion, the nomenclature was consolidated;
all genes were referred to as atg (autophagy-related) genes
[18].
currently, 27 atg have been identiﬁed in s. cerevisiae.
most are grouped into three large groups by their function:
non-selective autophagy (17 genes), selective autophagy (7
genes), and degradation of autophagic bodies (2 genes) [19].
one can regard selective autophagy as a type of macroauto-
phagy in which cargo proteins and organelles are selectivity en-
wrapped. thus, autophagosome formation mediated by genes
involved in non-selective autophagy is essential for selective
autophagy. among all of the genes involved in this pathway,
the 17 atg genes compose the machinery of autophagosome
formation. the proteins they encode make up the autophago-
some at a perivacuolar and restricted site called the pas
[20,21]. hereafter, we will focus on these 17 genes and their
role in the molecular basis of autophagosome formation.
4. atg genes required for autophagy
using yeast genetic techniques, mutants deﬁcient in the
autophagic and the cvt pathways were obtained in s. cerevi-
siae. apg (autophagy) [1] and aut (autophagy) [13] genes
were identiﬁed as essential genes for autophagy, and cvt
genes were identiﬁed as those required for the cvt pathway
5. atg genes involved in autophagosome formation
the contents of the autophagosome are sequestered by dou-
ble lipid bilayers. despite their role in biosynthesis rather
than degradation, we consider cvt vesicles to be variants of
autophagosomes, owing to similarities in their topology and

formation. an autophagosome is formed through nucleation
and expansion steps (fig. 2a) [22,23]. the nucleation step is
suﬃcient for generating a minimum-size autophagosome, such
as a cvt vesicle. subsequent membrane expansion is needed to
form a normal-sized autophagosome. because genes involved
in the expansion step are not necessary for cvt vesicle forma-
tion, they can bypass the cvt phenotype upon nitrogen starva-
tion or rapamycin treatment, whereas these in the nucleation
step cannot, resulting in the emergence of mature ape1 [22].
the 17 atg proteins are categorized into six functional units
[21]: (i) the atg1 protein kinase and its regulators [24]; (ii) the
atg2æatg18 complex [21]; (iii) the atg8 system [25]; (iv) the
atg12 system [26]; (v) the autophagy-speciﬁc phosphatidylino-
sitol 3-kinase (as-pi3k) complex [27]; and (vi) atg9 [28]. atg8
and atg12 are ubiquitin-like proteins [29]. atg8 is conjugated
to phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) by serial reactions of atg4
(an atg8 processing enzyme), atg7 (an e1-like protein), and
atg3 (an e2-like protein). atg12 is activated by atg7 and con-
jugated to atg5 by atg10 (an e2-like protein) to become the
atg12–atg5 conjugate [30]. this conjugate is organized into
a complex by associating with atg16 to form the at-
g16 æ atg5–atg12 complex [31]. formation of atg8-pe and
the atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex is essential for autophago-
some formation. as a consequence, autophagosome formation
is accomplished by six functional complexes or modiﬁed pro-
teins:
the atg1 protein kinase and its regulators (atg1,
atg13, and atg17), the atg2 æ atg18 complex, atg8-pe, the
atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex, the as-pi3k complex (vps30/
atg6 and atg14), and atg9.
among these, the atg2 æ atg18 complex, the atg16 æ atg5–
atg12 complex, the as-pi3k complex, and atg9 are required
for the nucleation step, whereas atg8-pe is involved in the

saccharomyces cerevisiae. (a) the 17 atg genes are distinguished by
the step they are involved in. the nucleation step is required for
formation of the cvt vesicle, a minimum closed vesicle. in addition to
the nucleation step, an expansion step is needed to form the
autophagosome, a larger membrane-bound structure. (b) a hierarchy

expansion step (fig. 2b). the atg1 kinase and its regulators
showed a complicated phenotype: atg1 is essential for nucle-
ation, but its regulators (atg13 and atg17) are required for
the expansion step. recently, atg29 has been found to be re-
quired for the expansion step [32]. the role of atg29 needs
to be investigated further.
6. atg proteins involved in expansion
atg13 and atg17, the regulators of the atg1 serine/threonine
protein kinase, are required for the expansion step [33–35]. as
noted, inactivation of tor kinase induces autophagy. which
atg protein receives the autophagy-inducing signal
from
tor? atg13 is hyper-phosphorylated under growing condi-
tions, and our group found that dephosphorylation of atg13p
is closely related to tor inactivation. upon tor kinase inacti-
vation by rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation, atg13p
is rapidly dephosphorylated within several minutes [24]. the
identities of the phosphatases involved in this reaction are un-
known, but inactivation of tor kinase directly or indirectly
leads to dephosphorylation of atg13p. dephosphorylated
atg13p binds to atg1p [36]. this binding activates the atg1p
kinase activity from a basal level. atg17 is also involved in this
activation step, but its involvement is possibly indirect (see be-
low). one study demonstrated that a conformational change of
atg1p initiate autophagosome formation [33]. to elucidate the
mechanisms of autophagy induction by atg1 kinase and its
regulators, the substrates of atg1 kinase must be determined.
atg8-pe is another molecule involved in the expansion step
[22]. atg8 is highly expressed during autophagy [37]. this
expression is essential for the expansion of the im; inhibition
of protein synthesis by cycloheximide immediately aﬀects the
size of autophagosomes [22]. in the process of autophagosome
formation, atg8-pe localizes to the ims [37]. this also sug-
gests a role for atg8-pe in im expansion. cleavage of atg8-
pe to atg8 by atg4 is also required for generation of normal
autophagosomes [38]. in the absence of atg8-pe cleavage, the
curvature of the im and the direction of im expansion are
abnormal (our unpublished observation). the responses of
atg13 and atg8 to rapamycin are independent of each other
[22]. at least two signaling pathways are activated upon initi-
ation of autophagosome formation.
7. atg proteins required for nucleation
the as-pi3k complex (vps30/atg6, atg14, vps15, and
vps34) and the atg2 æ atg18 complex are essential for nucle-
ation. the functions of both complexes are closely related to
phosphoinositide processing. in s. cerevisiae, vps34 is the sole
pi3k [39] and is essential for autophagosome formation [27].
the role of the as-pi3k complex is apparently to produce
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (ptdins(3)p) at the pas.
the localization of this complex at the pas is controlled by
atg14 [40]. our systematic localization analysis of atg proteins
suggests that one role of the as-pi3k complex is to recruit
other eﬀector proteins to the pas [21].
atg18 has been reported to be an eﬀector protein bound to
phosphatidylinositol 3, 5-bisphosphate (ptdins(3, 5)p2) [41]. in
yeast, ptdins(3, 5)p2

required for
ptdins(3)p 5-kinase, from ptdins(3)p produced by vps34 [42].
thus, in the absence of pi3k activity, yeast cells are able to
produce neither ptdins(3)p nor ptdins(3, 5)p2. fab1 is dispens-
able for autophagosome formation [41]; thus, ptdins(3, 5)p2 is
not
activity. ptdins(3)p and
ptdins(4)p have also been suggested to be binding partners
of atg18 [41,43]. our recent study showed that atg18 is re-
cruited to the pas in a manner dependent upon the as-
pi3k complex, suggesting that ptdins(3)p is a key player in
autophagosome formation by recruiting atg18.
autophagic
atg2 forms a complex with atg18, but the localization pat-
terns of these proteins are diﬀerent [21]; whereas atg2 localizes
only to the pas, atg18 additionally localizes to the vacuolar
membrane. in the absence of atg2, atg18 disappears from
the pas, but it is still seen at the vacuolar membrane [21]. this
pattern may exist because of ptdins(3)p produced by the pi3k
complex required for the vacuolar protein sorting pathway or
ptdins(3, 5)p2 generated by fab1. atg2 and atg18 reciprocally
require each other to localize to the pas [21]. presumably, for-
mation of the atg2 æ atg18 complex acquires the ability to
bind to phosphoinositides required for pas localization. how-
ever, the functions of atg2 and atg18 in the nucleation step
remain to be elucidated.
the atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex is another complex re-
quired for the nucleation step. in mammalian cells, atg5 is
localized to the outer face of expanding ims and detaches just
after completion of autophagosome formation; this observa-
tion suggests that this complex plays a coatmer-like role in
autophagosome formation [44]. like the atg2 æ atg18 com-
plex, localization of the atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex to the
pas depends on the as-pi3k complex [21], suggesting that
this complex interacts with ptdins(3)p.
among atg proteins, atg9 is known as the only integral
membrane protein [28]. fluorescence microscopy reveals that
atg9-gfp exists as two populations: one in the pas and an-
other in the periphery, composed of a few dozen small punc-
tate structures moving rapidly around the cytoplasm. lack
of atg1 activity leads to atg9 accumulation to the pas;
atg9 is abundant in the pas at non-permissive temperatures
in the atg1ts strain, but this accumulation is not seen at permis-
sive temperatures. this study proposed the hypothesis that
atg9 is recycled between the pas and the cytoplasmic pool
[45,46]. the most important issue to be addressed at the pres-
ent time is the relationship between the pas and peripheral
pools. does atg9 really cycle between these two pools? if this
cycle exists,
is it essential for autophagosome formation?
regardless of these details, however, it is clear that atg9 is dee-
ply involved in the nucleation step. in the absence of atg9,
pas organization is severely damaged, with a number of atg
proteins missing from the pas [21]. this phenotype is compat-
ible with atg9 mainly playing a role in recruiting the as-pi3k
complex to the pas.
8. machinery involved in expansion of the isolation membrane
ptdins(3)p is a lipid involved in autophagosome formation,
but it does not seem to be suﬃciently abundant to account for
the large amount of lipids required for the expanding im. it is
one possibility that lipids are carried by a structure containing
the transmembrane protein atg9. in an atg9-recycling model,
the atg9-structure provides lipids to the pas or expanding
ims and recycles back to the cytoplasmic pool to recruit lipids
to be delivered [45]. it has been proposed that mitochondria
may serve as a lipid source [47]. direct evidence of involvement
of atg9 recycling in expansion of the im, however, has not yet
been obtained.
atg8-pe and the atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex are known to
localize to the im [20,44]. atg8-pe is tightly associated with
membranes [38]; if it plays a role in delivering lipids to the
expanding im, then atg8-pe containing structures should be
targeted to the pas or im. because pe is a cone-shaped
phospholipid, it cannot be the only constituent of a vesicle;
incorporation of other lipids is required. the route of atg8-
pe traﬃcking has not been described fully; however, it is likely
that atg8-pe is ultimately delivered to the pas or the expand-
ing edge of the ims. atg8-pe is localized on both of the im
membranes, but the atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex resides only
on the outer face. the association of atg8-pe with the at-
g16 æ atg5–atg12 complex possibly underlies the curvature of
the im [48]. once autophagosome formation is complete, the
atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex is uncoated immediately. this
reaction may be mediated by cleavage of atg8-pe by atg4,
resulting in a fusion-competent autophagosome.
9. source of the isolation membrane
the nascent autophagosome is a curved membrane sac
called the im (fig. 1). the autophagosome becomes mature
upon fusion of the leading edges of the expanding ims. during
expansion of the ims, the outer and the inner faces of unit
membranes appear diﬀerentiated (see above) [44,49]. the prop-
erties underlying the diﬀerence between the outer and inner
faces remain to be elucidated. localization analysis of the
other atg proteins on the ims will help reveal the mechanisms
by which these diﬀerences are established.
the mechanisms of im expansion are not fully understood.
although it is likely that multiple organelles are involved in
supplying membranes to the im, the possible main source of
the im is the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane. involve-
ment of conventional vesicular transport was suspected by a
negative observation with electron microscopy: typical secre-
tory vesicles were not found at the leading edge of the expand-
ing ims [37]. however, the er membrane plays an important
role in the expansion of ims. formation of the copii vesicle
is essential for er-to-golgi transport. a mutant defective in
the subcomplex required for copii vesicle formation (sec23/
24) participates in autophagosome formation, but other mu-
tants (sec12 and sec13/31) do not [9]. interestingly, the autoph-
agy defect of the sec24 mutant is rescued by overexpression of
the sec24 homologue sfb2; deletion of the gene encoding this
protein does not aﬀect autophagic activity [50]. conventional
copii vesicles may not be involved in expansion of the ims,
but some copii proteins may mediate ﬂow in the early secre-
tory pathway required for autophagosome formation.
to examine the possible involvement of the er in auto-
phagosome formation, the er was labeled with an hdel
(his-asp-glu-leu)
signal peptide-tagged gfp (hdel-
gfp), which has a retention sequence to the er lumen [51].
a fraction of hdel-gfp was transported to the vacuole
upon starvation and stained the vacuolar lumen. this trans-
port was blocked in the autophagy-defective mutants, suggest-
ing that the hdel-gfp transport depends on autophagy. on
2160

the other hand, a protein on the golgi membrane was not
delivered to the vacuole. immunoelectron microscopy revealed
that fragmented er membranes were enclosed within auto-
phagosomes; yet, involvement of er membranes the in expan-
sion of ims has not been shown to date. this approach has
been diﬃcult, because very few marker proteins of the im have
been identiﬁed. more such markers must be identiﬁed in order
to further investigate the membrane sources of the im.
it is unlikely that canonical vesicular transport is involved in
expansion of the im (see above). similarly, conventional fu-
sion machinery used in the endomembrane system, nsf (n-
ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein), snap (soluble nsf
attachment protein), and snare (snap receptor) [52–54],
is not involved in expansion of the im and completion of auto-
phagosome formation. in the mutant of sec18, a gene encod-
ing the sole yeast nsf, most vesicular traﬃcking events,
including autophagosome fusion to the vacuole, are blocked,
but autophagosomes are normally formed [9]. also, sec17
(snap) and vti1 (snare) mutants are defective in auto-
phagosome fusion to the vacuole, but not in autophagosome
formation [9]. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that
residual activity of these proteins at non-permissive tempera-
tures is suﬃcient for the fusion event during expansion of
the im, or that these mutants are not defective in the fusion
event required for expansion of the im. because the essential
proteins for conventional vesicular traﬃcking are not required
for expansion of the im, there likely exists an unknown traf-
ﬁcking system from the er to the im.
10. role of the pre-autophagosomal structure in expansion of the
isolation membrane
the six atg complexes/proteins concentrate and work at the
pas [20]. although speciﬁc targeting mechanisms have not yet
been identiﬁed, it is likely that the main role of the pas is to
generate ims by concentrating atg proteins to a restricted site.
two models are possible regarding the relationship between
the pas and the im (fig. 3). in one model, the pas generates
ims (fig. 3a); in the second, the pas is directly converted into
ims (fig. 3b). in yeast, atg8 and most other atg proteins still
localize to the pas even after production of autophagosomes
[20]; this seems to support the former model. in the case of
yeast, the pas seems to associate with the im until it becomes
a mature autophagosome; this suggests that the pas is respon-
sible for sealing the im. on the other hand, in mammals, a
crescent-shaped membrane labeled with atg5 is transformed
to a mature autophagosome, after which atg5 leaves the mem-
brane of the autophagosome [44]. this observation suggests
the pas matures and transforms into the autophagosome.
these hypotheses raise the signiﬁcant question of whether
the crescent-shaped membrane is a counterpart of the pas
in yeast. it is still possible to hypothesize the existence of the
multiple pas structures in mammals. recently, our group
found that atg17 determines the site of pas organization
(fig. 2b) [21], but unfortunately the homologue of atg17
has not yet been identiﬁed in mammals. in order to character-
ize the mammalian pas equivalent, a functional homologue of
atg17p must be identiﬁed.
11. concluding remarks
juhasz and neufeld have discussed the origins of autophagic
membranes in their review [55]. two models of im expansion
were presented: one is a maturation model, in which pre-exist-
ing organelle membranes are delivered to or mature into the
im. if this model is true, the pas might play a converter-like
role from the er membrane to the im. the pas pumps ims
out of the er by coating the membranes with atg8-pe and the
atg16 æ atg5–atg12 complex, generating the correct curvature.
there is the possibility that the pas is a uniquely diﬀerentiated
region of the er. a second proposed model is the assembly
model; non-vesicular transport or de novo synthesis of mem-
brane is responsible for im expansion. however, as enzymes
required for lipid synthesis do not occur among the atg pro-
teins, general lipid synthetic pathways would have to be in-
volved in this synthesis. determining the lipid composition

of ims and autophagosomes should provide insight into this
issue.
recent studies have elucidated the process of autophagy at
the molecular level; parts of the machine (atg proteins) and
the factory (pas) have already been found. the most impor-
tant outstanding mystery concerns the precise materials that
make up these structures. to identify them may require the
isolation of ims or autophagosomes and their subsequent
material analysis. quite recently, atg31 has been character-
ized as a gene required for im expansion [56].
