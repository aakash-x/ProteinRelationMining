autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation process through
which a portion of the cytoplasm is delivered to lysosomes to be
degraded1–4. although the primary role of autophagy in many
organisms is in adaptation to starvation, autophagy is also thought
to be important for normal turnover of cytoplasmic contents,
particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons. autophagy may
have a protective role against the development of a number of
neurodegenerative diseases5–8. here we report that loss of autophagy
causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease-
associated mutant proteins. mice deﬁcient for atg5 (autophagy-
related 5) speciﬁcally in neural cells develop progressive deﬁcits in
motor function that are accompanied by the accumulation of
cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. in atg5 2/2 cells, diffuse,
abnormal intracellular proteins accumulate, and then form aggre-
gates and inclusions. these results suggest that the continuous
clearance of diffuse cytosolic proteins through basal autophagy is
important for preventing the accumulation of abnormal proteins,
which can disrupt neural function and ultimately lead to
neurodegeneration.
every eukaryotic cell has two main systems for the degradation of
intracellular components: the ubiquitin–proteasome system and
autophagy. autophagy is a generic term for the degradation of
cellular components in lysosomes1–4. macroautophagy (hereafter
referred to as autophagy) is believed to be the main pathway among
several subtypes of autophagy. during the process of autophagy,
small portions of cytoplasm are sequestered by autophagosomes
and then degraded on fusion with lysosomes. in contrast to the
ubiquitin–proteasome system, which accounts for most of the
selective intracellular protein degradation, autophagy is less selective.
autophagy induced by starvation is a mechanism for producing
amino acids within cells. in yeast, autophagy-defective cells are
susceptible to starvation. in comparison, mice deﬁcient for atg5
and atg7, which are essential for autophagosome formation9, suffer
from severe nutrient- and energy-insufﬁciency soon after birth10,11.
thus, adaptation to starvation is an evolutionarily conserved role of
autophagy.
in addition to induced autophagy, a low level of constitutive
autophagy is important for intracellular clearance under normal
conditions. mice bearing a liver-speciﬁc conditional knockout allele
of atg7 show hepatic dysfunction and intracellular ubiquitin-positive
inclusion bodies11. we have also observed the accumulation of
ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in hepatocytes and a subset of
neurons in atg5-knockout (atg5 2/2) neonates (supplementary
fig. s1); however, conventional histological analysis revealed no
signiﬁcant abnormality10. these data suggest that intracellular pro-
tein quality-control by autophagy is particularly important in neural
cells. indeed, several studies have suggested that impairment of
autophagy could worsen the accumulation of abnormal proteins in
neurodegenerative disease models in vitro and in vivo5–8. however,
direct evidence demonstrating that autophagy contributes to the
prevention of neurodegeneration has been lacking, in part because
atg5 2/2 and atg7 2/2 mice die soon after birth10,11.
to determine the role of autophagy in neural cells, we generated
neural-cell-speciﬁc atg5 2/2 mice (supplementary fig. s2). mice
bearing an atg5 ﬂox allele, in which exon 3 of the atg5 gene is
ﬂanked by two loxp sequences, were crossed with a transgenic line
expressing cre recombinase under the control of the nestin promoter
(nestin-cre)12. in these mice, cre recombinase is expressed in neural
precursor cells after embryonic day (e)10.5, causing deletion of the
loxp-ﬂanked exon 3 (supplementary fig. s3). recombination was
successful in over 90% of all brain cells from atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre
mice. the expression of atg5 (detected as an atg12–atg5
conjugate13) and the atg5-dependent conversion of microtubule-
associated protein 1 light chain 3 (lc3)-i to lc3-ii (lc3–phospha-
tidylethanolamine (lc3–pe) conjugate)13,14 were almost completely
suppressed in the brains of atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice after e15.5
(fig. 1a and supplementary fig. s3). these data suggest that
autophagosome formation is impaired in the brains of these mutant
mice.
atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice were born normally and survived
neonatal starvation. they did not show the suckling defects observed
in atg5 2/2 and atg7 2/2 neonates10,11, suggesting that an undetect-
able, but sufﬁcient, level of atg5 remains in the neurons controlling
the suckling response at this stage, or that non-neural cells may
mediate the suckling deﬁcit in the non-conditional mutants. how-
ever, the atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice showed growth retardation:
their mean body weight was about 1.5-times lower than that of control
(atg5 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-cre) mice (fig. 1b). atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice
developed progressive motor and behavioural deﬁcits after three
weeks of age, and footprint analysis revealed an ataxic walking
pattern (fig. 1c). mean stride lengths corrected for paw base widths
were signiﬁcantly decreased compared with control (atg5 ﬂox/þ
nestin-cre) mice. the atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice showed limb-
clasping reﬂexes when they were suspended by their tails, whereas
control mice extended their limbs (fig. 1d). this abnormal reﬂex is
often observed in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease15,16.

rotarod (fig. 1e) and wire-hanging (data not shown) tasks also
showed severely impaired motor coordination, balance and grip
strength in atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice. finally, tremor was apparent
in 12-week-old mice. some of the atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice died
after three weeks of age. neither atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox mice (cre-negative) nor
atg5 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-cre mice showed any abnormal phenotype.
the gross anatomy of the brain of the mutant mice was normal.
however, histological examination revealed degenerative changes in
the neurons of atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice. these alterations were
most prominent in cerebellar purkinje cells. haematoxylin and eosin
(h&e) staining (arrowheads in fig. 2a) and immunohistochemical
staining with an antibody directed against calbindin (a selective
marker for purkinje cells, left panels in fig. 2b), demonstrated partial
loss of these neurons (fig. 2c). the remaining purkinje cells showed
eccentrically located nuclei, with infolding of the nuclear membrane.
we also found a number of eosinophilic spheroids in h&e-stained
sections in the cerebellar nuclei of these mutant mice (arrows in fig. 2a),
which probably correspond to the calbindin-positive spheroids in
the same region (fig. 2b, right panels). these structures suggest
massive swelling of purkinje cell axons that project to the cerebellar
nuclei17,18. in addition, tunel-positive cells were detected in the
adjacent granular layer, suggesting apoptosis of granular cells in
atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice (fig. 2d). consistent with previous
observations, the survival of granular cells largely depends on their
synaptic connectivity with purkinje cells19. axonal swelling was
observed in other regions of the atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre brain,
including the cerebral cortex, the nucleus gracilis (fig. 2a), the
posterior thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, inferior colliculus, tri-
geminal nucleus, parabranchial nucleus, anterior thalamic nucleus,
caudal pons and reticular nucleus (data not shown). partial loss of
pyramidal cells also was observed in the cerebral cortex (data not
shown). together, these data suggest that atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice
suffer from neurodegeneration.
we next examined protein aggregation in the brain using an
antibody against ubiquitin, a marker of misfolded proteins. large,
ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies accumulated in the cytoplasm of
large neurons in the thalamus, pons, medulla, dorsal root ganglion
(drg) (fig. 3a) and midbrain (data not shown) of atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox;
nestin-cre mice. neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus
(especially in the ca3 and ca4 regions) (fig. 3a), striatum and
olfactory bulb (data not shown) were also positive for these inclusion

bodies. such inclusion bodies were not observed in the brains of
control (atg5 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-cre) mice. we observed ubiquitin-positive
inclusion bodies exclusively in cells positive for the neural cell marker
neun, suggesting that inclusion bodies were generated only in
neurons and not in glial cells (fig. 3b). notably, although there
was extensive loss of purkinje cells, these neurons had very few
inclusion bodies in their cell bodies (fig. 3a). numerous ubiquitin-
positive dots were observed in the cerebellar nuclei (fig. 3a), but
most of them did not colocalize with the calbindin dots observed in
fig. 2b (data not shown).
the accumulation of inclusion bodies was time-dependent, and
the distribution of inclusion-body-positive cells was more limited in
atg5 2/2 and atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre newborns compared to adult
mice. in atg5 2/2 neonates, inclusion bodies were observed in the
pons, drg, spinal cord (ventral horn) (supplementary fig. s1),
hypothalamus, midbrain and trigeminal ganglia (data not shown),
but not in the cerebral cortex (supplementary fig. s1). a similar
pattern was observed in the brain and drg of atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre
neonates (supplementary fig. s4 and data not shown). immuno-

demonstrated the speciﬁc association of ubiquitin with amorphous,
occasionally ﬁlamentous, structures (fig. 3c, left), as well as with
more compact structures surrounded by ﬁlamentous materials
(fig. 3c, right; see supplementary fig. s5 for larger images). outside
the brain, atg5 2/2 neonates showed inclusion body formation in the
liver, the anterior lobe of pituitary gland (supplementary fig. s1) and
the adrenal gland (data not shown).
histological examination of atg5 2/2 and atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre
mice suggested that, in addition to the presence of inclusion bodies,
the intensity of diffuse cytoplasmic ubiquitin staining was higher
compared with wild-type mice. we thus analysed the time course of
accumulation of diffuse ubiquitinated proteins and inclusions in
drg neurons (the neonatal tissue in which inclusion body formation
was most striking). drg neurons from atg5 2/2 embryos at e13.5
had no apparent abnormality. however, at e15.5, some neurons
had accumulated diffuse, cytosolic ubiquitinated proteins with
infrequent inclusions (fig. 4a). later, in newborn (postnatal day
(p)0) atg5 2/2 mice, multiple ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies
were present in drg neurons. thus, the accumulation of diffuse
abnormal proteins seems to be the primary cellular phenotype of
atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre neurons. we obtained similar results using a
biochemical method with whole brains. polyubiquitinated proteins
that accumulated in atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre brains were primarily
triton-soluble in six-week-old mice (fig. 4b). in contrast, in 14-
week-old mice, triton-insoluble polyubiquitinated proteins were
also abundant, suggesting that inclusion body formation is a later
event.
we conﬁrmed these observations using hepatocytes, another cell
type that showed extensive inclusion body accumulation under
autophagy-defective conditions11 (supplementary fig. s1). we
crossed atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox mice with cag-cre mice that express cre
recombinase ubiquitously (see methods)20. as recombination efﬁ-
ciency was not high when crossed with our atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox mice, the
resulting mice (atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; cag-cre) were mosaic for the mutant
allele and viable. in the livers of these mice, the atg5 gene was deleted
in only about 30% of hepatocytes (supplementary fig. s6), which
allowed us to compare directly the immunoreactivity of knockout
cells with that of wild-type cells in the same specimen. anti-ubiquitin
staining of the liver in four-month-old atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; cag-cre mice
showed that about 30% of cells had very high levels of diffuse
cytoplasmic signals (in addition to inclusion bodies), compared
with surrounding cells that were probably wild type (fig. 4c). the
results clearly demonstrate that cytosolic ubiquitinated proteins also
accumulate in atg5 2/2 hepatocytes.
we then determined the time course of accumulation of ubiqui-
tinated proteins using mx1-cre transgenic mice21. in this system,
cre recombinase is expressed under the control of an interferon-
responsive promoter that can be activated by application of poly-
inosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (pipc), an interferon-inducible,
synthetic double-stranded rna. the atg5 gene in atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox;
mx1-cre liver was deleted by intraperitoneal injection of pipc.
soon after injection, most targeted cells showed only diffuse ubiqui-
tin staining, with no inclusion bodies (fig. 4d, e). in contrast, large,
ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies were present in almost all tar-
geted hepatocytes 16 days after pipc injection (arrowheads in
fig. 4d). cells with only inclusion bodies but not diffuse cytoplasmic
staining were observed very rarely. taken together, our data demon-
strate that loss of autophagy ﬁrst leads to accumulation of diffuse
abnormal proteins, followed by generation of inclusion bodies.
we have shown that the inhibition of autophagy in neural cells
causes neurodegeneration and symptoms of neurological pathology.
as the mouse model we used does not express any disease-associated
mutant proteins, the phenotype of these mutant mice indicates that
autophagy mediates essential and continuous turnover of intracellu-
lar proteins. this system is particularly important for neurons, in
which deregulation of this degradation process can induce cell
dysfunction. the role of autophagy could be even more critical if

any aggregation-prone mutant proteins were expressed. although
autophagy is generally thought to be a non-selective process, several
studies have suggested that autophagosomes can speciﬁcally engulf
inclusion bodies8,22. in our system, however, inclusion bodies
appeared in later phases of autophagy deﬁciency, suggesting that
the primary role of autophagy under normal conditions is the
turnover of diffuse cytosolic proteins, not direct elimination of
inclusion bodies. as the population of ubiquitinated proteins in
atg5 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre brains was similar to that in wild-type mouse
brains, we suggest that cytoplasmic proteins that are usually ubiqui-
tinated, rather than speciﬁc proteins, accumulate in larger amounts
in the absence of autophagy (supplementary fig. s7). downregula-
tion of protein turnover could cause the accumulation of abnormal
proteins, which then could promote aggregate formation (sup-
plementary fig. s8).
the critical role of autophagy in the basal turnover of diffuse
cytosolic proteins in neural cells should be emphasized, because it has
been suggested that large inclusion bodies themselves might not be
pathogenic, but that mutant proteins present diffusely in the cytosol
could be the primary source of toxicity23–27. however, we do not rule
out the possibility that autophagosomes can selectively recognize
abnormal soluble proteins or microaggregates on the membrane sur-
face. it was recently reported that the polyubiquitin-binding protein
p62/sqstm1 might mediate the speciﬁc recognition of protein
aggregates by autophagosomes28. this pathway might also be involved
in the degradation of diffuse ubiquitinated proteins by autophagy.
