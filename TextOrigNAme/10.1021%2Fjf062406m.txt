solanum nigrum l. (sn) has been used in traditional folk medicine to treat different cancers. it is
also used as a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory agent. in this study, we demonstrated that
the extract of sn (sne) induced a strong cytotoxic effect toward hepg2 cells but much less to chang
liver and wrl-68 cells. the mechanisms of the cytotoxic effect were concentration-dependent. high
doses of sne (2 and 5 mg/ml) induced apoptotic cell death in hepg2 cells, as evidenced by increases
in the expressions of p-jnk and bax, mitochodrial release of cytochrome c, and caspase activation.
on the other hand, cells treated with low concentrations of sne (50-1000 (cid:237)g/ml) revealed
morphological and ultrastructural changes of autophagocytic death under electron microscopic
observation. furthermore, these cells showed increased levels of autophagic vacuoles and lc3-i
and lc3-ii proteins, specific markers of autophagy. the levels of bcl-2 and akt that have been
implicated in the down-regulation of autophagy were decreased upon sne treatment. taken together,
these findings indicate that sne induced cell death in hepatoma cells via two distinct antineoplastic
activities of sne, the ability to induce apoptosis and autophagocytosis, therefore suggesting that it
may provide leverage to treat liver cancer.

introduction
the united kingdom, and japan,
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is a deadly disease with poor
prognosis and a 5 year survival rate of about 5%. it is one of
the most common human malignancies in sub-saharan africa,
south east asia, and china. although the incidence of hcc is
generally lower in developed countries such as the united states,
france,
it has increased
significantly over the past decade (1). according to world
health organization statistics, of 6350000 cancer cases reported
each year, 4% are hcc, 42% of which occur in china.
traditional treatment of liver tumors typically has been surgical
resection and chemotherapeutics. however, these commonly
used techniques are frequently challenged in view of metastasis
and other pathological changes. therefore, the development of
new agents for hepatocellular cancer is important to reduce the
mortality caused by this disease.

solanum nigrum l. (sn) is an herbal plant indigenous to asia
and grows wildly and abundantly in open fields. it has been
used in traditional oriental medicines for treating various kinds
of tumors and is believed to have various biological activities
(2). for examples, sn has been used to cure hepatic cancer for
a long time in oriental medicine (3). previous investigations
have shown that extracts of sn suppressed the oxidant-mediated
dna-sugar damage (3), and the plant exerted cytoprotection
against gentamicin-induced toxicity on vero cells (4) and
antineoplastic activity against sarcoma 180 in mice (5). more
recent studies revealed that extracts of sn induced apoptosis
in mcf-7 cells (2) and inhibited 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-
13-acetate-induced tumor promotion in hct-116 cells (6). the
ethanol extract of dried fruits of sn had a remarkable hepato-
protective effect in ccl4-induced liver damage (7). these studies
suggest that sn possesses a beneficial activity as an antioxidant
and antitumor-promoting agent, although the mechanism for the
activity remains to be elucidated.
in chinese traditional medicine, sn is believed to have
antitumor properties against many types of cancer, including
liver cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, colon
cancer, and bladder cancer, and is also used as a hepatoprotective
and anti-inflammatory agent, although the mechanism for the

activity remains to be elucidated (3, 4). the latest report revealed
that the ethanol extract of dried fruits of sn has a remarkable
hepatoprotective effect against ccl4-induced liver damage (7).
this study developed some understanding of the effects of sn
on liver cancer cells to evaluate its therapeutic application in
treating liver cancer.
sn has been reported to contain many polyphenolic com-
pounds, mainly flavonoids and steroids. the antioxidant and
antitumor activity of sn may be due to the presence of
polyphenolic constituents. the presence of steroidal glycosides,
steroidal alkaroids, steroidal oligoglycosides, solamargine, and
solasonine has also been detected (8).
the purpose of this work was to study the effects of sn on
liver cancer cells to evaluate its therapeutic potential in treating
liver cancer. in this report, we describe experiments that showed
that water extracts of sn induced programmed cell death in
liver cancer cells. the death mechanism was characterized,
revealing that sn not only initiated apoptosis but also caused
cell death through autophagocytosis (type ii programmed cell
death). the results of this investigation provide scientific
evidence for the application of this herbal medicine in liver
cancer therapy.
materials and methods
preparation of extracts of sn (sne). the whole plant of sn was
collected from the mountain in miaoli, taiwan. the plants were washed,
cut into small pieces, shade-dried for 3 days, and then dried overnight
in an oven. the dried sn (800 g) was mixed with water (5000 ml)
for 30 min and subjected to continuous hot extraction (100 (cid:176) c, 40 min).
the resulting water extract was filtered and subsequently concentrated
with a water bath (90 (cid:176) c) until it became creamy and was dried in an
oven (70 (cid:176) c) that finally gave 185 g (23.125% of initial amount) of
powder (water extract of sn). the concentration used in the experiment
was based on the dry weight of the extract.
determination of total phenolics, polysaccharide, and protein.
the concentration of total phenols was analyzed according to the folin-
ciocalteu method (9). briefly, sne (0.1 mg) was dissolved in a test
tube with 1 ml of distilled water, and folin-ciocalteu reagent (2 n,
0.5 ml) was then added and mixed thoroughly. after an interval of 3
min, 3 ml of 2% na2co3 solution was added, and the mixture was
allowed to stand for 15 min with intermittent mixing. the absorbance
of the mixture at 750 nm was measured on a hitachi u-3210
spectrophotometer (hitachi, tokyo, japan) with gallic acid as the
standard. the contents of polysaccharide and protein in sne were
determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method and bio-rad protein
assay kit, respectively.
characterization of phenolic compounds of sne. analyses were
performed on a finnigan surveyor modular hplc system (thermo
electron co., united states). the chromatographic separation of the
compounds was achieved using an analytical column: luna 3 (cid:237)m c18-
(2) 150 mm (cid:2) 2.0 mm and guard column, securityguard c18 (ods)
4 mm (cid:2) 3.0 mm i.d. (phenomenex, inc., torrance, ca) at a flow rate
of 0.2 ml/min. mobile phases a and b were water and acetonitrile,
respectively, both containing 0.1% formic acid. gradient elution was
conducted as follows: 0-15 min of 5% b, 15-50 min of 5-40% b,
and 50-55 min of 40-95% b with a linear gradient, followed by 55-
65 min of 95% b isocratic. a photodiode array detector was operated
at wavelengths between 220 and 400 nm. the system was coupled to
a finnigan lcq advantage max ion trap mass spectrometer and
operated in electrospray ionization (esi) mode. samples of 20 (cid:237)l of
extracts were directly injected into the column using a rheodyne (model
7725i) injection valve. the esi source and negative ionization mode
were used with different fragment voltages. nitrogen was used as the
nebulizing and drying gas. the typical operating parameters were as
follows: spray needle voltage, 5 kv; ion transfer capillary temperature,
300 (cid:176) c; nitrogen sheath gas, 40; and auxiliary gas, 5 (arbitrary units).
the ion trap contained helium damping gas, which was introduced in
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. mass spectra

were acquired in a m/z range of 100-1000, with five microscans and
a maximum ion injection time of 200 ms. the sim analysis was a
narrow scan event that monitored the m/z value of the selected ion, in
a range of 1.0 th centered on the peak for the molecular ion; this
function was used in the analysis of molecular ions of the flavonoids
for ms/ms in negative esi modes. the ms/ms fragment spectra were
produced using normalized collision energies with an increment of 30%
and also with wideband activation “off” (10).
cell culture and sne treatment. hepg2, a human liver cancer
cell line; wrl-68, a human fetal liver cell line; chang liver, a human
liver cell line; 3t3-l1, mouse embryonic fibroblast; mcf-7, human
breast adenocarcinoma; mda-mb-231, human adenocarcinoma (grade
iii); and ags, human gastric adenocarcinoma, were obtained from
atcc (manassas, va). hepg2, wrl-68, 3t3-l1, mcf-7, and mda-
mb-231 cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(life technologies, grand island, ny) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (fbs), 2 mm glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mg/
ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid, and 1 mm
sodium pyruvate. chang liver cells were cultured in basal medium
eagle (sigma, steinheim, germany) supplemented with 10% calf serum,
100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. ags cells
were cultured in 90% ham’s f-12k medium supplemented with 10%
fbs. all cell cultures were maintained at 37 (cid:176) c in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% co2. for sne treatment, appropriate amounts of
stock solution (100 mg/ml in culture medium) of sne were added to
the cultured cells to achieve the indicated concentrations and then
incubated for the indicated time periods. in time-course experiments,
the cells were treated with sne of 10, 50, 100, and 500 (cid:237)g/ml and 1,
2, and 5 mg/ml for the indicated periods.
determination of cell viability [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay]. to evaluate the cyto-
toxicity of sne, the mtt assay was performed to determine the cell
viability (11). cells were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of 3.5
(cid:2) 104 cells/well and treated with sne at 0-5 mg/ml concentration at
37 (cid:176) c for 24 and 48 h. in inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated
with 2 mm 3-ma. after the exposure, media were removed, and the
cells were washed with phoshate-buffered saline (pbs). thereafter, the
medium was changed to the one containing 100 (cid:237)l mtt (5 mg/ml)/
well for another 4 h incubation. the viable cell number per dish was
directly proportional
to the production of formazan, which was
solubilized in isopropanol, and was measured spectrophotometrically
at 563 nm.
flow cytometric analysis. cells synchronized at the g0 phase by
serum starvation for 24 h were incubated in fresh medium containing
10% v/v fbs to allow the progression through the cell cycle. at various
time periods after relief of the quiescent state, the cells were analyzed
for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry (12). after various
treatments, hepg2 cells were treated with trypsin and rnase and then
stained with propidium iodide (pi). the cell cycle distribution was
presented as the number of cells vs the amount of dna as indicated
by the intensity of fluorescence, and the extent of apoptosis was
determined by counting cells of dna content below the sub-g1 peak.
western blot analysis. after the indicated sne treatment, the
medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with pbs twice. after
the addition of 0.1 ml of cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
and protease inhibitors, the cells were scraped followed by a vortex at
0 (cid:176) c for 10 min. the cell lysate was then subjected to a centrifugation
of 10000g for 10 min at 4 (cid:176) c. resultant protein samples were separated
in a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane as previously described. the blot was sequentially incubated
with 5% nonfat milk in pbs for 1 h to block nonspecific binding, with

or lc3 (kindly provided by drs. yoshimori and mizushima, national
institute for basic biology, okazaki, japan) for 2 h and then with an
appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sigma, st.
louis, mo) for 1 h. all incubations were carried out at 37 (cid:176) c, and
intensive pbs washing was performed between each incubation. after
the final pbs wash, the signal was developed by 4-chloro-1-napthol/
3,3-o-diaminobenzidine, and the relative photographic density was
quantitated by scanning the photographic negatives by a gel documenta-
tion and analysis system (alpha imager 2000, alpha innotech corp.,
san leandro, ca).
electron microscopy. the cells were harvested by trypsinization,
washed twice with pbs, and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, 4%
paraformaldehyde, and 1% tannic acid in 0.1 mol/l cacodylate buffer,
ph 7.4, for 25 h at 4 (cid:176) c. after they were washed with pbs, the cells
were stained with osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium. this proce-
dure was carried out by incubating cells in 1% oso4 in 0.1 mol/l
cacodylate buffer, ph 7.4, for 1 h followed by 1% thiocarbohydrazide
in h2o for 15 min and then 1% oso4 for 15 min. extensive washing
of cells with distilled water was performed between each step. after
staining, the cells were dehydrated in a graded series of etoh to 100%
etoh and then immersed serially with 1:1 hexamethyldisilazane and
absolute ethanol and pure hexamethyldisilazane for 5 min each. after
air drying from hexamethyldisilazane overnight, the cells were embed-
ded in agarose gel. one micrometer thin sections were cut, and the
gels were coated with 500 å of gold in a jeol vacuum sputter coater
and viewed in a jeol t300 electron microscope with scanning
attachment (jeol, tokyo, japan) (13).
detection of acidic vesicular organelles (avos) with acridine
orange staining. to detect avos in sne-treated cells, the vital
staining with acridine orange was performed as described previously
(14). the treated tumor cells were stained with acridine orange, which
was added at a final concentration of 1 (cid:237)g/ml for 15 min. samples
were then examined under a fluorescence microscope. acridine orange
labelled avo, such as autophagosomes. a typical acridine orange-
positive cell exhibited granular distribution of acridine orange in the
cytoplasm, indicative of autophagosome formation.
statistical analysis. statistical significances were analyzed by one-
way analysis of variance (anova) with posthoc dunnett’s test. a p
value of e 0.05 was considered statistically significant (sigma-stat
2.0, jandel scientific, san rafael, ca).
results
composition of sne. to establish the composition of sne
from sn, the contents of polyphenol and polysaccharide were
assayed, and the concentrations of polyphenolic acids were
determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc).
as shown in table 1, the dry weight yield of sne was 23.125
( 2.095%, consisting of 20.35 ( 0.967% total polyphenolics
using gallic acid as the standard and 14.92 ( 1.333% polysac-
charide. polysaccharide is usually associated with protein as
complexes; the result indicated that sne contained 4.81 (
0.442% protein. hplc analysis of the standard polyphenols
showed that the retention times of gallic aicd, protocatechuic
acid (pca), catechin, caffeic acid, epicatechin, rutin, and
naringenin were 6.2, 13.49, 31.48, 32.84, 35.61, 4.035, and 49.16
min, respectively (figure 1 and table 2). the analysis of sne
revealed the presence of gallic acid (2.897%), pca (1.977%),
catechin (2.353%), caffeic acid (1.988%), epicatechin (0.392%),
rutin (0.836%), and naringenin (5.106%). the further identities
of the seven components were established from recorded mass
spectra. the mass spectra of the phenolic acids are listed in
table 2. the extract was stored at -20 (cid:176) c and used in the
following studies. in the present study, we have identified the
contents of polysaccharides and proteins in sne and character-
ized seven phenolic compounds of sne.

cytotoxic effects of sne on hepg2 cells. in this study,
we first determined the cytotoxicity of sne by treating hepg2,
wrl-68, and chang liver cells with sne at various concentra-
tions for 24 and 48 h followed by mtt assay. the human
hepatic cell line wrl-68 has a morphological structure similar
to hepatocytes and hepatic primary cultures. derived from fetal
liver, wrl-68 cells secrete r-fetoprotein and albumin, preserve
the activity of some characteristic or specific liver enzymes (i.e.,
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, (cid:231)-glutamyl
transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase), and exhibit a cytok-
eratin pattern similar to other hepatic cultures, providing an in
vitro model to study the toxic effects of xenobiotics (15).
the addition of sne exerted a cytotoxic effect in a dose-
and time-dependent manner (figure 2a,b). following a 24 h
incubation with 50 (cid:237)g/ml sne in hepg2 cells, the cytotoxicity
was around 22.7-27.4% (figure 2a). however, when 100-
5000 (cid:237)g/ml extract was added, a significant
increase in
cytotoxicity was observed. furthermore, a time-dependent
increase in sne-induced cytotoxicity was also detected (figure
2b). the strongest potency of sne on the cytotoxicity of cells
was toward hepg2 liver cancer cells. the concentration of sne
on the inhibition of 50% of hepg2 cells viability (ic50) was
0.625 mg/ml. however, the ic50 values of sne to the death
of chang liver (human liver cells; ic50, 3.2 mg/ml sne) and
wrl-68 (human fetal liver cell; ic50, 3.0 mg/ml sne) were
5.12- and 4.8-fold higher than that of hepg2 cells, indicating
that sne is less cytotoxic to normal cells. as compared to
normal liver cells, sne seems to have a stronger death effect
toward liver cancer cells, hepg2. we further determined the
cytotoxicity of sne on other normal cells, 3t3-l1, and cancer
cells, mcf-7, mda-mb-231, and ags, at various concentra-
tions for 48 h followed by mtt assay. the results indicated
that sne is more cytotoxic to tumor cells.
sne-induced apoptotic death of hepg2 cells. hepg2
cells treated with 2 and 5 mg/ml sne for 48 h showed typical
apoptotic features: cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and
apoptotic bodies as observed under inverted microscopy. to
further confirm that programmed cell death was involved in
the cytotoxic effect of sne on liver cancer cells, sne-treated
hepg2 cells were subjected to apoptosis assays by pi staining
of nuclei as described in the materials and methods, and the
apoptotic state was quantitated by flow cytometry. the results
indicated that after a treatment with high concentration (2 and
5 mg/ml) of sne for 48 h, an increased proportion of apoptotic
cells was observed (figure 3a). the ratio of cells at the
hypodiploid phase was increased to 30.01 and 37.88% when
hepg2 cells were exposed to 2.0 and 5.0 mg/ml sne for 48
h, respectively (figure 3a). the results indicated that high doses
of sne induced apoptotic cell death in hepg2 cells.
effect of sne on jnk phosphorylation and bax protein
expression. jnk plays an important role in apoptotic signaling.
in some cell types, jnk regulates the activities of pre-existing
figure 2. effects of sne on the viability of tumor cells (hepg2, chang
liver, mcf-7, mda-231, and ags cells) and normal cells (wrl-68 and
3t3 cells). cells were treated with 0, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, or
5000 (cid:237)g/ml of sne for 24 and 48 h before they were subjected to a
mtt assay for cell viability. the data were expressed as a percentage of
the control (dose 0) and presented as means – sd from three independent
experiments. results were statistically analyzed with student’s t-test (*p
< 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).
bcl-2 family proteins that mediate mitochondrial release of
cytochrome c, resulting in caspase activation (16). we inves-
tigated whether the sne-induced apoptosis was modulated by
the activation of jnk. the results showed that the cellular level
of phospho-jnk was significantly increased to 2.65- and 2.81-

to analyze (b) p-jnk and bax, (c) cytochrome c, and (d) cleaved caspase 3 expression as described in the materials and methods. the levels of these
proteins were subsequently quantitated by densitometric analysis; that of the control was 100%. data were presented as means – sd from three
independent experiments. results were statistically evaluated by using one-way anova with posthoc dunnett’s test (**p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001).
fold (p < 0.001) of the control level under a treatment of 2
and 5 mg/ml sne, respectively (figure 3b). investigations of
the bcl-2 gene family that encodes integral membrane proteins
have shown a complex network regulating apoptosis in multiple
biological systems (17). we examined the cellular levels of bax
after the treatment of sne for 48 h in hepg2 cells. the
expressions of bax were significantly induced by the treatment
of 2 and 5 mg/ml of sne to 3.45- and 3.52-fold (p < 0.001),
respectively (figure 3b). sne induced apoptotic cell death in
hepg2 cells, as evidenced by an increase in the expression of
p-jnk and bax.
effect of sne on cytochrome c release and caspase 3
cleavage. because cytochrome c is reported to be involved in
the activation of the caspase that executes apoptosis (18), we
examined the level of cytochrome c in the cytosol by western
blot analysis. the results showed that the amount of cytosolic
cytochrome c increased 1.88- and 2.05-fold (p < 0.001) in the
2 and 5 mg/ml sne-treated hepg2 cells (figure 3c). caspase
3 is a cytosolic protein that exists normally as an inactive
precursor with higher molecular masses (32 kda) that is cleaved
proteolytically into low molecular masses (20 kda) when the
cell undergoes apoptosis (19). in this study, there was an
increase in the activation of caspase 3 to 1.91-, 2.3-, and 2.45-
fold (**p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001) of control level in response
to 1, 2, and 5 mg/ml sne treatment, respectively (figure 3d).
the results indicated that addition of sne exerted an apoptotic
effect in hepg2 cells by increases in the mitochondrial release
of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 3.
low concentration of sne-induced autophagic cell
death in hepg2 cells. the flow cytometric data (figure 3a)
showed that there was only a very small portion (<4%) of
hepg2 cells that displayed a typical morphology of apoptosis
when the cells were exposed to low concentrations (50-1000
(cid:237)g/ml) of sne. at the same circumstances, the survival rates

were down to 67.7 and 20% for 50 and 1000 (cid:237)g/ml,
respectively (figure 2b). these observations indicated that
some other death mechanism was initiated in hepg2 cells in
response to the treatment of low concentrations (50-1000 (cid:237)g/
ml) of sne.
electron microscopic characterization, which has been the
gold standard for determining the mode of cell death, was next
used to distinguish between apoptosis, necrosis, and nonapop-
totic programmed cell death. nonapoptotic programmed cell
death is principally attributed to autophagy (type ii programmed
cell death). autophagy is series of biochemical steps through
which eukaryotic cells commit suicide by degrading their own
cytoplasm and organelles through a process in which these
components are engulfed and then digested in double membrane-
bound vacuoles called autophagosomes (20). transmission
electron microscopic analysis of hepg2 cells without sne
treatment revealed normal nuclear and mitochondrial morphol-
ogy (figure 4a, a). on the other hand, hepg2 cells treated
with 100 (cid:237)g/ml sne for 48 h revealed extensive vacuolization,
formation of membranous whorls (also called myelin figures),
and depletion of organelles, which are hallmarks of autophagy
(figure 4a, b,c). cells undergoing autophagic cell death
retained an intact nuclear membrane, without chromatin con-
densation. initiation of autophagy was associated with an
accumulation of lipid droplets in cytoplasm (fatty change of
hepatocytes) (figure 4a, b). this event is due to a decline in
protein synthesis (vide infra), which blocks the utilization of
lipids for lipid-protein conjugation and is typical of hepatocytes
undergoing cellular stress (21).
autophagy is characterized by avo formation, which is
detected and measured by vital staining of acridine orange.
acridine orange moves freely to cross biological membranes
and accumulates in acidic compartment, where it is seen as
fluorescence bright red (22). as shown in figure 4b, b-f, vital
staining of hepg2 cells with acridine orange showed the
accumulation of avo in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to 10-
1000 (cid:237)g/ml of sne. in contrast, there were relatively few
avos in the cytoplasm of control cells (figure 4b, a). these
data indicated that hepg2 cells treated with a low concentration
of sne revealed morphology and ultrastructural changes of
autophagocytic death and increased levels of autophagic vacu-
oles.
involvement of lc3 in sne-induced autophagy. lc3 is
localized in autophagosome membranes during amino acid
starvation-induced autophagy (23). a recent
investigation
showed that there are two forms of lc3 proteins in cells: lc3-i
and lc3-ii (22). lc3-i is the cytoplasmic form of lc3 and is
processed into lc3-ii, which is associated with the autopha-
gosome membrane. therefore, the amount of lc3-ii is cor-
related with the extent of autophagosome formation. using the
immunoblotting analysis with anti-lc3 antibody, we examined
the expressions of lc3-i (18 kda) and lc3-ii (16 kda) in
hepg2 cells treated with sne. as shown in figure 5a, the
level of total lc3 (lc3-i and lc3-ii proteins) increased in
hepg2 cells 24 h after exposure to sne. moreover, a marked
increase in lc3-ii protein was also detected in these cells. these
results indicate that sne stimulated not only the accumulation
of lc3 protein but also the conversion of a fraction of lc3-i
into lc3-ii. lc3 was involved in the sne-induced autophagy
in hepg2 cells.
effect of sne on bcl-2 expression and akt phosphory-
lation. autophagy is a multistep process, and various signaling
pathways have been implicated in its up- or down-regulation.
bcl-2 has also been shown to regulate autophagy in cancer cells.

a serine-threonine kinase, located downstream of class i pi3k,
that activates the kinase mtor, leading to suppression of
autophagy. we examined the level of phospho-akt in the cytosol
by western blot analysis. the results showed that the amount
of phospho-akt decreased to 45, 40, and 25% of control in the
cells exposed to 100, 500, and 1000 (cid:237)g/ml of sne treatment,
respectively (p < 0.001) (figure 5c). these results indicate
that bcl-2 and akt were involved in the sne-induced autoph-
agy.
3-ma partially blocked the sne-induced lc3-ii conver-
sion and cell death. to confirm the contribution of autophage
in the sne-induced cell death, we used the autophagy inhibitor
3-ma, a class iii-pi3k inhibitor, to inhibit the autophagy. the
mtt assays show that 2 mm 3-ma could partially prevent
sne-induced cell death (figure 6b). the induction of lc3-i
and lc3-ii expression was also inhibited by 3-ma (figure 6a).
on the basis of these data, we concluded that sne could induce
hepg2 cells to undergo autophagic cell death.
discussion
sn is a common herb that grows wildly and abundantly in
open fields. it has been used in traditional folk medicine because
of its diuretic and antipyretic effects. more specifically, it has
been used to cure inflammation, edema, mastitis, and hepatic
cancer for a long time in oriental medicine (25). the phy-
tochemical studies revealed the presence of an alkaloid called
involvement of lc3, bcl-2, and p-akt in sne-induced autophagy

in hepg2 cells. hepg2 cells were treated with sne at a concentration of
0, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 (cid:237)g/ml for 12 h and then subjected to western
blotting to analyze (a) lc3, (b) bcl-2, and (c) p-akt expression as
described in the materials and methods. the levels of these proteins were
subsequently quantitated by densitometric analysis; that of the control
was 100%. data were presented as means – sd from three independent
experiments. results were statistically evaluated by using one-way anova
with posthoc dunnett’s test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).
down-regulation of bcl-2 using antisense technology triggered
autophagy, but not apoptosis, in hl60 human leukemic cells
(24). we investigated whether the sne-induced autophagy was
modulated by bcl-2. the results showed that the cellular level
of bcl-2 was significantly decreased to 80, 25, and 18% of that
of control in the cells exposed to 100, 500, and 1000 (cid:237)g/ml of
sne treatment, respectively (figure 5b). furthermore, akt is

solamargine, nigrum i, nigrum ii, and a glycoside named
solasodine (7). it has also been shown that sn contains many
polyphenolic compounds, mainly flavonoids and steroids. our
results showed that sne consists of 14.92% polysaccharides,
4.81% protein, and 20.35% total polyphenols, such as gallic
acid (2.897%), pca (1.977%), catechin (2.353%), caffeic acid
(1.988%), epicatechin (0.392%), rutin (0.836%), naringenin
(5.106%), and unknown polyphenols (tables 1 and 2 and
figure 1). the antioxidant and antitumor activity of these
extracts have been suggested to be due to the presence of
polysaccharides and polyphenolic constituents. nevertheless,
there is little conclusive evidence demonstrating the effectiveness
of sn on treating already existing 50-1000 (cid:237)g/ml tumors or
malignancies animals.
our results demonstrated a significant cytotoxic effect of sne
on hepg2 cells that was mediated via two mechanisms
depending on the exposed concentrations. when hepg2 cells
were treated with a high concentration (2 and 5 mg/ml) of sne,
the cells underwent apoptotic cell death as evidenced by
increases in sub-g1 cells and cellular levels of phospho-jnk,
bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, and cleaved-caspase 3. the
exposure of a low concentration (50-1000 (cid:237)g/ml) of sne did
not result in apoptosis, but rather, our results point to autoph-
agocytosis (autophagy of type ii programmed cell death) as the
main mode of death under such conditions.
autophagy is a physiological mechanism that involves the
sequestration of cytoplasm and intracellular organelles into
membrane vacuoles and results in their eventual enzymatic
degradation (20). in response to appropriate stimulation, depo-
larized mitochondria are known to move into autophagic
vacuoles. thus, mitochondrial dysfunction may be a point of
overlap between apoptotic and autophagocytic processes (26).
the fusion of the edges of the membrane sac forms a closed
double-membrane structure, the so-called autophagosome. fi-
nally, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome to become the
autolysosome within which lysosomal hydrolases degrade the
sequestered cellular constituents. hepg2 cells treated with 50-
1000 (cid:237)g/ml of sne demonstrated an ultrastructural appearance
consistent with the characteristics of autophagy under electron
microscopic observation. furthermore, sne-treated cells were
able to be stained with acridine orange, a specific marker for
autophagic vacuoles (22). confirmatory experiments were
performed with anti-lc3 antibody showing that sne stimulated
not only the expression of lc3 protein but also the conversion
of a fraction of lc3-i into lc3-ii. we also demonstrated that
3-ma could block the sne-induced lc3-ii conversion and cell
death. furthermore, the levels of bcl-2 and akt that have been
implicated in down-regulation of autophagy were decreased
upon sne treatment, confirming the involvement of bcl-2 and
akt in the sne-induced autophagy (24).
nonapoptotic cell death is mainly attributed to autophagy,
which is considered to be an alternative way to kill tumor cells
when the cells are chemoresistant on the basis of ineffective
apoptosis. a number of studies have reported that autophagy is
activated in cancer cells in response to various anticancer
therapies, such as tamoxifen in breast cancer cells (27),
temozolomide (tmz, a dna alkylating agent), and arsenic
trioxide in malignant glioma cells (28). as for natural products,
resveratrol, a phytoalexin that is present in grape nuts and red
wine, induced autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (29), and
soybean b group triterpenoid saponins caused autophagy in
colon cancer cells (30). the results of present study add sne
to the list of natural products that possess autophagic effects in
addition to its apoptotic effect. we have demonstrated that the
cytotoxic effects after exposure to a high concentration (2 and
5 mg/ml) of sne is caused by apoptosis and a low concentra-
tion of sne is caused by autophagy. however, the molecular
basis for the different effect responding to high and low
concentrations of sne needs further investigation. there might
be a cross-talk between the pathways of apoptosis and autoph-
agy.
in summary, we have identified two distinct antineoplastic
activities of sne in liver cancer cells, the ability to induce
apoptosis and autophagocytosis. this response and its ability
to kill these cells hint at the possibility that this agent may be
useful as an adjuvant therapy to treat liver tumors. these
findings pave the way for additional experiments to consider
the molecular basis for this response and studies to determine
whether adequate concentrations of bioactive sne can be
attained to treat liver tumors.
