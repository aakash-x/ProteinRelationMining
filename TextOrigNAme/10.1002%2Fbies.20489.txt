autophagy in neuronal cell loss:
a road to death
krisztina taka´ cs-vellai,1 andrew bayci,2 and tibor vellai1*
summary
the regulation of ageing has been extensively studied in
divergent animal model systems including worms, flies
and mice. however, little is known about the cellular
pathways that mediate the death of these organisms.
analysing major cellular changes in the ageing nematode
caenorhabditis elegans has revealed a gradual, progres-
sive deterioration of different tissues except for the
nervous system, which remarkably preserves its integrity
even in advanced old age. in addition, genetic data have
shown that, in c. elegans and in the fruit fly drosophila
melanogaster, lifespan is controlled by signals derived
from neurons and acting throughout adulthood. orga-
nismal death thus seems to be a consequence of the
decline of specific neurons. accumulating evidence
demonstrates that
loss
generally occurs via autophagy, a process in which
eukaryotic cells self-digest parts of their contents during
development or to survive starvation. here we suggest
that overactivation of autophagy in the cells of the
nervous system is the eventual cause of ‘‘physiological’’
death. bioessays 28:1126–1131, 2006.

introduction
understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms under-
lying the death of organisms is a fundamental and fascinating
problem in biology. whether death is a simple consequence
of the accumulation of malfunctioning cells during ageing or
results from a genetically regulated and thereby influenceable
process is unclear. throughout human history many different
cultures have tried to solve this puzzle by inventing myths and
stories that have, however, rarely been supported with actual
evidence. today, this topic can be studied empirically using the
methods of genetics, cell biology and physiology. analysing the
biological processes involved in death will provide a better
understanding of how longevity is influenced by environmental
and genetic factors.

loss of
the affected cells,
the intracellular accumulation of damaged macromole-
cules and organelles, in particular mitochondria, is a feature
common to aged cells.(1–3) the occurrence of autophagy
has been implicated in these age-related manifestations (for
review, see ref. 3). autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved
catabolic (self-degradative) process in all eukaryotic cells and
contributes to the turnover of cytoplasmic components. it is a
crucial process for cell survival under extreme conditions and
contributes by providing the energy for cell functioning.(4)
recent experimental evidence shows that activation of
autophagy, either by disinhibition or active induction, can lead
to the efficient
implying that
maintaining the basal activity of the autophagic degradation
of intracellular components is critical for cells to survive.(5 –7)
this is particularly important for long-lived cells such as those
of the nervous system, which is known to act as a central
regulator of animal longevity.(8) thus, autophagy may repre-
sent a link between lifespan regulation and cellular energy
levels. in this article, we review the role of autophagy in cell
death and present a hypothesis for the underlying cause of
normal age-related organismal death. we suggest that it is
the late onset of neuronal loss via enhanced autophagy that
ultimately causes the physiological death of the organism.
when neurons become deprived of nutrients, long after cell
loss has contributed to the deterioration of other tissues in
advanced old age,(9) they employ autophagy for short-term
survival, but this eventually leads to their demise and to the
demise of the whole animal.
neural regulation of lifespan
in divergent animal phyla, lifespan is regulated hormonally by a
conserved neuroendocrine system, the insulin/igf-1 (insulin-
like growth factor-1) signalling pathway.(1,10 –12) mutant nema-
todes, flies and mice with decreased insulin/igf-1 receptor
activity live significantly longer than wild types. the insulin/
igf-1 receptor induces a phosphatidylinositol-3-oh kinase
(pi3-kinase)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (pdk1)/
akt kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway that antag-
onises a forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor called
foxo.(13 –19) without activation of this signalling axis, foxo
induces extreme longevity. recently, insulin/igf-1 signalling
was shown to interact with the tor (for ‘‘target of rapamycin’’)
kinase-mediated pathway to control lifespan in c. elegans and
drosophila (fig. 1).(20 –23) tor influences cell growth and

replicative lifespan in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.(27)
the activity of tor kinases is coupled with cellular energy
levels. starvation and reduced food intake (dietary restriction),
which is known to extend lifespan by slowing metabolism and
reducing the short-term risk of death,(2,28,29) cause down-
regulation of tor that, in turn, reduces the protein synthesis
activity of the cell.
an important consequence of deregulating tor is the
activation of autophagic cellular degradation (fig. 1). autop-
hagy is a highly orchestrated process involving various
kinases and phosphatases in which eukaryotic cells consume
parts of their cytoplasm during development and in response
to nutrient deprivation.(4,30 –34) during autophagy, subcellular
material is sequestered by special isolation membranes into
lysosomes for subsequent breakdown by acidic hydrolases. in
some cases, autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic contents
occurs as part of programmed cell death.(31– 33) genes that
mediate the autophagic process act downstream of and are
inhibited by the insulin/igf-1 and tor signalling pathways
(fig. 1).(35,36) therefore, cytoplasmic remodelling through
macromolecule and organelle recycling might be critical for
longevity. to date, however, the only genetic indication for the
involvement of autophagy in the ageing control results from
rna interference-mediated depletion of
the c. elegans
autophagy protein bec-1/beclin1, which inhibits lifespan
extension in long-lived mutant nematodes.(36) to determine
whether mutations in autophagy genes affect lifespan in an
otherwise wild-type background is of major interest.
ageing may be a consequence of cumulative oxidative
damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ros)
produced during respiration.(2) indeed, overexpression of the
enzyme superoxide dismutase, which reduces ros, extends
lifespan in drosophila and yeast. alternatively, the lack of
protein turnover may cause ageing. autophagy is an efficient
way to remove oxidatively damaged, aberrant macromole-
cules, in particular proteins, and organelles by degrading them
within lysosomes (fig. 1). thus, autophagy may slow down
accumulation of the potentially harmful cytoplasmic compo-
nents by speeding up their turnover. because autophagy
participates in the turnover of mitochondria whose function
also affects ageing,(37,38) it is also important to know whether a
compromised autophagic process eliminates mitochondrial
dysfunction-mediated extension of adult lifespan. together,
autophagy may control lifespan by interacting with multiple
ageing regulatory pathways and mechanisms (fig. 1).
components of
the insuin/igf-1 signalling pathway,
the tor kinases and autophagy gene products accumulate
ubiquitously in the nervous system throughout the nematode
lifespan.(39-42) moreover, in analyses to identify tissues where
insulin/igf-1 signalling affects ageing,(8,19) the restoration of
insulin-like signalling in neurons alone in mutant worms with
aberrant insulin/igf-1 receptor was sufficient to specify wild-
type adult lifespan. genetic mosaic analysis showed that
daf-2/igf-1 and daf-16/foxo act cell nonautonomously in a set
of neurons to control lifespan extension in c. elegans.(43,44) it
was suggested that daf-2/igf-1 may function in a systemic and
quantitative way in multiple neuronal cell types to regulate the
lifespan of the animal; daf-2 activity within these signalling cells
controls the production of a (secondary) signal that regulates
the lifespan of all the cells that age in the animal. similarly,
drosophila foxo regulates ageing when activated in the adult
brain.(19) although daf-16 and dfoxo also operate as
lifespan modulators in the intestine and peripheral fat body
respectively,(19,44) these lipid-containing tissues are important

hypotheses
for fuelling neurons with energy sources. together, these data
point to the nervous system as a central regulator of animal
longevity.
structural and functional integrity of the
nervous system during senescence
a gradual decline in cellular integrity is a prominent feature of
tissue-specific changes that accompany animal ageing. for
example, a marked decrease in the cytoplasmic volume of
muscle cells and a gross reduction in myofilament number
contribute to age-related general
loss of muscle mass in
nematodes, flies and mammals.(9,45,46) sarcomere geometry
is also progressively compromised with age in these organ-
isms. destructive cellular changes in the muscle tissue over
time, resembling human sarcopenia, may underlie progressive
locomotory impairment, starting in mid-life.
several other tissues, such as intestine and hypodermis,
also display deterioration of cellular integrity for the duration of
the lifespan.(9) for example, vacuole-like structures accumu-
late in the c. elegans intestinal cells following the reproductive
period. furthermore, intestinal and hypodermal cells often
suffer from random local crisis over the lifespan, causing the
loss of the affected cell. however, how these catastrophic
events contribute to organismal death in advanced age is
unknown.
in animals,
the entire life cycle.
the nervous system regulates the central
biological processes. in addition, animal longevity is controlled
by neuronal signals that appear to operate exclusively during
adulthood, to relatively advanced ages. for example, daf-2/
igf-1 and daf-16/foxo act throughout the reproductive period
to influence c. elegans ageing.(47) the insulin/igf-1 pathway
may also function after this period when the rate of macro-
molecule turnover falls dramatically. thus, one can assume
that neurons, at least a specific group of them, must function
throughout
indeed, examination of
c. elegans neurons expressing reporters labelled with green
fluorescent protein failed to produce any evidence of age-
related degeneration.(9) this implies that all major structures
of the nematode nervous system remain intact throughout the
lifespan. the intactness of neurons is apparent even in older
animals that exhibit severe defects in behaviour or locomo-
tion.(9) in addition, neuronal microtubule bundles and nuclear
structures in old individuals are comparable with those in
young adults. similarly, there is no indication for neuronal cell
loss or restructuring of neurites during drosophila ageing.(48)
stereological imaging of human brain regions also demon-
strates no significant neuronal cell death associated with
normal senescence. therefore, the basic maintenance of
neuronal integrity might be a common feature of animal ageing.
autophagy in neuronal degeneration
autophagy is implicated in various physiological and patholo-
gical states in the nervous system.(5) a strong association
1128 bioessays 28.11
between the autophagic process and neuronal function results
from studies of lurcher mice bearing a gain-of-function
mutation in the orphan delta 2 glutamate receptor
(glurd2).(49) this mutation causes neuronal degeneration
in vivo. characterisation of a protein complex bound to glurd2
identified the autophagy protein beclin1 as a component of the
complex.(50) this finding raised the possibility that autophagy,
in addition to apoptosis, contributes to lurcher pathology.
indeed, degrading lurcher purkinje cells display intense
autophagic activity. furthermore, upregulation of beclin1
was shown to be induced in neurons undergoing degenera-
tion.(51) it would seem that the involvement of autophagy in
neuronal cell loss and synaptic function is an important area for
future investigation.
electron microscopic analysis of young adult nematodes
was unable to detect any sign of macroautophagic vacuole
formation in neurons.(42) indeed, autophagic vacuoles are also
rarely seen in the normal, mature nervous system of other
animals. the possible functional significance of autophagy in
neuronal physiology has been discussed mainly in the context
of human pathological conditions such as alzheimer’s,
parkinson’s, hungtinton’s and prion diseases. alzheimer’s
disease is the most prevalent human neurodegenerative
disorder that is defined by intraneuronal fibrillary tangles
containing an aggregated form of the microtubule-associated
protein tau, or by neuritic plaques consisting of extracellularly
aggregated b-amyloid.(52) at early stages of alzheimer’s
disease, the autophagic process is significantly induced in
many neurons that progressively accumulate lysosomes as
they become metabolically compromised. autophagy may
also be involved in b-amyloidogenesis because b-amyloid
production decreases when autophagic vacuole formation is
blocked.(5) parkinson’s disease is characterised by degenera-
tion of specific dopaminergic neurons that accumulate
filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions,
termed lewy bodies,
consisting of mainly a-synuclein. macroautophagic vacuole-
like structures have been found in dying neurons in parkinson’s
disease patients. furthermore, degradation of normal
a-synuclein has been suggested to occur via chaperon-
mediated autophagy.(53) consistently, forced expression of
a-synuclein in neuronal cell lines causes a marked induction of
autophagy.(54) huntington’s disease is the most-common form
of inherited neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by
mutations of cag trinucleotide repeat expansion, resulting in
long polyglutamine tracts in the mutant proteins. autophagy is
suggested to represent a clearance mechanism that elim-
inates the aggregated polyglutamine-expanded proteins.
indeed,
the autophagy–lysosomal pathway
suspends the clearance of mutant huntingtin proteins.(55)
moreover, mutant proteins with polyglutamine expansions are
often localised into lysosomes.
inhibition of
prion diseases are characterised by the conversion of
normal cellular glycoproteins to abnormal, insoluble isoforms.
hypotheses
these abnormal proteins accumulate in the brain, causing
massive neuronal vacuolation and loss.
intense vacuole
formation in the affected neurons indicates a role for auto-
phagy in the pathogenesis of prion diseases as well.(5,56) in
summary, neurons in healthy organisms are largely devoid of
autophagic vacuoles, whereas various neurodegenerative
conditions induce or upregulate the autophagic capacity of
these cells.
autophagy and death
whether autophagy is a cell defence mechanism in response
to various cellular stress conditions or a regulated cell-killing
pathway—it is often referred as to type ii programmed cell
death—has been a much-debated question. depending on the
actual cellular environment, autophagy may have a dual role in
cell survival; it acts both as a protector and contributor to cell
damage (fig. 2).(4,31) on the one hand, the initial activation of
autophagy protects neurons by (1) degrading intracellular
macromolecules and organelles to provide energy for cell
functioning during starvation (self-digestion) and (2) facilitat-
ing removal of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins,
protecting cells from further damage. autophagy is thus
essential for cell survival. indeed, inhibition of autophagy can
trigger apoptotic cell death. in c. elegans, the autophagy
protein bec-1 binds to and mediates the function of the
antiapoptotic factor ced-9/bcl2; inactivation of bec-1 can
induce somatic cells that otherwise survive in wild-type
animals to undergo apoptosis.(39) on the other hand,
prolonged or vigorous activation of autophagy may lead to
an effective elimination of the affected cell (self-cannibalism)
(fig. 2). it is still unclear whether enhanced autophagy alone
results in cell loss or ensures complete execution of apoptotic
cell death. although inactivation of the core apoptotic cell
death pathway under intense autophagy-inducing conditions
does not block the death of the cell committed to die, a terminal
necrotic-like degenerative phase through the action of spe-
cific proteases cannot also be excluded.(57,58) nevertheless,
increasing apoptosis by cellular stress causes early organ
degeneration and premature ageing.(59)
the nervous system coordinates the basic biological
processes throughout the life of animals. it also emits one or
more signals during adulthood that regulate the rate of
metabolism in all cells, which in turn determines how ageing
proceeds. therefore, the organism must keep neurons, at
least a specific set of them, intact and functioning to stay alive
(fig. 1). the cellular energy status of matured neurons is
generally favourable as they are abundantly fuelled with
energy sources from the adipose tissues. constant availability
of metabolites in these cells continuously activates the insulin/
igf-1 and the atp-sensor tor kinase-mediated signalling
axis (fig. 1). tor activity in turn sustains the autophagic
process at a basal level sufficient to maintain cellular home-
ostasis, including a balance in macromolecule and organelle
turnover (fig. 2).
in parallel with maintaining internal homeostasis in neurons
over time, other cell types including intestinal, muscle and
hypodermal cells frequently experience local stressful condi-
tions. these peripheral cells are less supplied with metabolites
than neurons. they also maintain potential
to proliferate
throughout the lifespan, accumulating somatic mutations that
may induce cellular damage. when metabolites are scare,
autophagy is upregulated upon downregulation of the insulin/
igf-1 signalling and tor pathways to degrade cellular
components in exchange for energy. overactivation of cellular
self-degradation, like its inhibition, can also cause the loss of
the exhausted cells. as cell
loss accumulates with age, a
figure 2. a model for how autophagy causes the physiological death of the organism. basal autophagy acts as a cell protective
mechanism. decreased autophagy leads to cell loss by allowing damaged proteins to accumulate and by failing to provide energy for cell
functioning. when neurons become deprived of nutrients, usually in advanced old age, they use autophagy to survive, and this prolonged
activation eventually leads to their demise and to the demise of the organism.
bioessays 28.11 1129
hypotheses
variety of basic biological functions—such as locomotion,
nourishment, digestion and adsorption, circulation, respiration
and metabolism—begin to malfunction. finally, the organism
reaches a physiological state in which a subset of matured
neurons starts to become deprived of metabolites and oxygen.
by this stage, normally reached in advanced old age,
the autophagic capacity of these neurons is activated to
ensure their survival and protect them from further damage.
because adverse conditions at that time cannot be reversed,
the autophagic process—passing through a critical threshold
level—becomes a mediator rather than a protector of neuronal
cell loss (fig. 2). autophagic self-eating alone or inducing the
executor apoptotic and/or necrotic-like pathways causes the
loss of the affected neurons. when a specific group of neurons
die, the organism as a whole perishes. similar events may
occur when tissues are severely injured. in vertebrates, for
example,
the arrest of circulation (clinical death) places
neurons under immediate oxygen and metabolite deprivation,
causing them to die within a short period (biological death). it
seems reasonable that it is the catastrophic collapse of a
subset of neurons required for coordinating basic biological
processes that results in the eventual death of the whole
organism.
conclusions
to explore the role of autophagy in neuronal cell survival and
loss will be essential for understanding how compromised
autophagic process leads to neurodegenerative disorders,
altered ageing rate and premature or delayed death. both
disinhibition and overactivation of autophagy seem to induce
neuronal degeneration, presumably through interacting with
the apoptotic and necrotic processes (fig. 1).(39) thus, fine-
tuning of the autophagic machinery in the nervous system is
critical for an organism to stay alive. this hypothesis remains to
be tested. for example, it would be intriguing to know whether
tissue-specific overexpression of autophagy genes from an
inducible promoter can cause the demise of neurons and
ultimately of the whole animal. here, it worth noting that
neuronal degeneration is coupled to upregulation of
the
autophagy gene beclin1,(60) but whether
this change in
beclin1 expression is a cause or a consequence of neuronal
loss is not clear. alternatively, one can block autophagy in
certain neurons in advanced old age, and test whether this
treatment influences the lifespan of the organism.
