abstract
macroautophagy is a process that sequesters and degrades organelles and macromolec-
ular constituents of cytoplasm for cellular restructuring and repair, and as a source of
nutrients for metabolic use in early starvation. extensive evidence has been reported that
macroautophagy process declines with increasing age. this impairment, probably due to
ad libitum feeding, may cause accumulation of altered structures leading to the age-related
decline in cell functions. it has been suggested that caloric restriction (cr) and disruption
of insulin-like signals contrast the process of aging by prolonged stimulation of macroauto-
phagy. according to this hypothesis, it is shown that life-long weekly administration of an
anti-lipolytic drug decreases glucose and insulin levels, stimulates autophagy and intensiﬁes
anti-aging eﬀects of submaximal cr.

1. introduction
aging is characterized by a progressive accumulation of damaged macromole-
cules, organelles and cytomembranes which may account for the age-associated mal-
functioning of many biological processes. the ineﬃciency and failure of
maintenance, repair and turnover pathways may be the main cause of damage accu-
mulation during aging (sohal et al., 1994; grune, 2000). turnover of cellular com-
ponents is based on a homeostatic balance between synthesis and degradation:
eukaryotic cells are equipped with several degradation system, a major of which is
the process of macroautophagy.
macroautophagy, generally referred to as macroautophagy,
is a universal,
dynamic process which takes place in all eukaryotic cells, that involves a rearrange-
ment of subcellular membranes to sequester cytoplasm and organelles for delivery to
the lysosome or vacuole, where the sequestered cargo is degraded and recycled (yor-
imitsu and klionsky, 2005).
the primary roles of macroautophagy are baseline turnover of intracellular pro-
teins and organelles, production of amino acids in nutrient emergency, and regres-
sion of retired tissues. these functions guarantee rejuvenation and adaptation to
adverse conditions, and even underlie dynamic processes such as development/meta-
morphosis (mizushima, 2005).
the major role of macroautophagy is starvation response. in fact, macroauto-
phagy deﬁcient yeasts succumb readily to starvation (tsukada and ohsumi, 1993)
and in mammalian, macroautophagy is induced in almost all organs in response
to nutrient starvation (mizushima et al., 2004) in order to maintain an amino acid

457
pool for gluconeogenesis and for synthesis of proteins essential to survival (yoshi-
mori, 2004).
extensive research on mammalian cells during the last three decades showed that
macroautophagy and lysosomal proteolysis are induced by lower amino acid and
insulin levels during fasting, whereas the higher (postprandial) levels of insulin fully
suppress macroautophagy in the physiological range of plasma amino acid concen-
tration (mortimore and poso, 1987; mortimore et al., 1989; seglen and bohley,
1992).
macroautophagy is also required for normal turnover of cellular components par-
ticularly in response to starvation (mortimore and poso, 1987). indeed, the bulk deg-
radation of
is mediated by
macroautophagy and the process is the only mechanism for the degradation of mem-
branes and organelles (pfeifer, 1978), including mitochondria (rodriguez-enriquez
et al., 2004) and peroxisomes (locci-cubeddu et al., 1985).
(90% of cellular protein)
long-lived proteins
macroautophagy has been demonstrated to play an important role in the degra-
dation of excess or injured organelles (yoshimori, 2004). in addition incubation of
primary cells and cell lines in the absence of serum promotes macroautophagy of
mitochondria with deleterious mtdna mutations but spares their normal counter-
parts (gu et al., 2004).
in conclusion macroautophagy is a cell-mechanism involved in both the survival
during starvation and the turnover of macromolecules, cytomembranes and organ-
elles (bergamini et al., 2004a,b).
experimental evidence was shown that
impairment of macroautophagy is
involved in the process of aging: in this review we focus on the consequences of mac-
roautophagy impairment and on the interventions that may contrast aging by stim-
ulation of macroautophagy.
2. the aging process
aging is a progressive deterioration of physiological function that impairs the
ability of an organism to maintain homeostasis and consequently increases the
organism’s susceptibility to disease and death (harman, 2001).
many theories of aging are based on the concept that damage, either due to nor-
mal toxic by-products of metabolism or ineﬃcient repair/defensive systems, accumu-
lates throughout the entire lifespan and causes aging.
the oxidative damage theory of aging postulates that the age-dependent accumu-
lation of oxidative damage to macromolecules causes a progressive functional dete-
rioration of cells, tissues and organ systems that manifests as functional senescence
and culminates in death (harman, 1956). the hypothesis is that as much as 1–2% of
the used oxygen might generate oxygen radicals, endogenously produced by mito-
chondria and peroxisomes, which are casually involved in the determination of the
rate of aging (barja, 2002; honda and honda, 2002; sohal, 2002).
the glycation hypothesis of aging (cerami, 1985) also views senescence as a con-
sequence of fuel use. however, in this case focus is not on oxygen but on carbohy-
458

drate fuel: high glucose diet (folmer et al., 2002) and elevated extra and intracellular
glucose concentrations result in an oxidative stress (bonnefont-rousselot et al.,
2000; ceriello, 2000) by several mechanisms including glucose autoxidation, protein
glycation and formation of advanced glycation endproducts, and the polyol pathway
(bonnefont-rousselot et al., 2000).
a major target of oxidative or non-oxidative damage are cellular and extracellular
protein. increase in the concentration of damaged proteins seems particularly impor-
tant because it would lead to the malfunction of virtually all biological processes. an
increase in the concentration of damaged intracellular proteins as well as an increase
in the concentration of inactive or partially active forms of various enzymes in aging
organisms is well-documented (reviewed in stadtman, 1988; rattan, 1996; rosenber-
ger, 1991). there is experimental evidence that certain proteolytic activities, a major
of which is macroautophagy, decrease with age (reviewed in ward, 2002; cuervo and
dice, 1998). the age-dependent decrease in the rate of protein turnover may be the
main cause of the increase in the concentration of damaged proteins with age
(ryazanov and nefsky, 2002).
mitochondrial theory of aging, a variant of free radical theory of aging, pro-
poses that accumulation of damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial dna
(mtdna) leads to aging of humans and animals (miquel et al., 1980). this theory
states that electrons leaking from the electron transfer chain (etc) play the major
role in the generation of ros (reactive oxygen species). the ensuing state of oxi-
dative stress results in damage to etc components and mtdna (mitochondrial
dna), thus increasing further the production of ros. ultimately, this ‘vicious
cycle’ leads to a physiological decline in cell function and aging (alexeyev et al.,
2004).
it has been supported by the observation that mitochondrial function declines
(yen et al., 1989; shigenaga et al., 1994) and mtdna mutation increases (reviewed
in wei and lee, 2002; alexeyev et al., 2004) in tissue cells in an age-dependent man-
ner. recent reports indicate that, when injurious cellular stresses occur, cells protect
themselves using macroautophagy to remove damaged mitochondria and mutated
mtdna (rodriguez-enriquez et al., 2004).
reports of aging-related changes in peroxisomal function raised the hypothesis
that peroxisomes may have a signiﬁcant role in the aging process (reviewed in
perichon et al., 1998) probably through the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ros). in addition, the age-related changes in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation activ-
ity may alter membrane lipid composition and thereby contribute to decline in cell
function. redundant, damaged or non-functional peroxisomes are degraded by mac-
roautophagy-related processes (kim and klionsky, 2000; locci-cubeddu et al.,
1985).
among most the likely targets of oxidative stress is the lipid–protein structured
biological membrane complex for several reasons. for instance, most cellular activ-
ities-associated with the membrane involve reactive species production; lipids are
exquisitely susceptible to oxidation and proteins contain various redox-sensitive
moieties. several investigators, including spiteller (2002), postulate that the deteri-
oration of membrane integrity is the underlying cause of the aging process. earlier,

zs-nagy (1994) proposed the essentiality of the cellular membrane in maintaining
intracellular homeostasis during aging. many age-related membrane alterations are
reported including lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress (matsuo et al.,
1993) and accumulation of membrane lipid dolichol that may be responsible for
the age-related impairment of membrane functions (e.g. transmembrane signaling)
(dolﬁ et al., 2003). high levels of autophagic function has been involved in main-
tenance of juvenile levels of dolichol, probably by renewal of cytomembranes
(marino et al., 1998).
3. intervention in aging: caloric restriction and disruption of insulin-like signaling
caloric restriction (cr) has a positive eﬀect on the median and maximum life-
span and health span of rodents and various invertebrate – protozoa, ﬂies, water
ﬂeas, nematodes, rotifers and spiders- and vertebrate species– ﬁsh, hamsters, dogs
(masoro, 2002). cr refers to the reduction in caloric intake while maintaining
essential nutrient requirements. traditionally, experimental mammalian models
of caloric restriction involve a reduction in caloric intake by 40% of the ad libitum
diet throughout the lifespan of the animal, which results in a 30–40% increase in
maximum lifespan (weindruch et al., 1986). cr also delays the age of onset
and/or the rate of progression of most age-associate diseases (masoro, 1999,
2002). the extension of lifespan and the prevention of disease are secondary to
the hormonal, physiological and biochemical adaptations that occur in response
to cr. compared to ad libitum-fed rodents of the same age, the physiologic pro-
cesses of old rodents maintained on a cr regimen are more like those of young
rodents (masoro, 2002).
it is well established that cr retards the age-related accumulation of oxidatively
damaged molecules in rodents (reviewed in yu, 1996). this eﬀect may be due to
either a decreased rate of generation of reactive oxygen species, or to increased eﬃ-
ciency of protective processes, or to an increase in repair activity, or to a combina-
tion of these processes. indeed, cr alters gene expression to favor expression of
genes involved in cell repair, protein synthesis and turnover, stress resistance and
glucose metabolism (lee et al., 1999, 2000).
cr is known to decrease the level of damaged protein in mice (sohal et al., 1994)
and rats (aksenova et al., 1998; youngman et al., 1992). this eﬀect could be due to
the decrease in protein degradation with increasing age (van remmen et al., 2001).
although both autophagic and proteasomal proteolysis decline during aging, macro-
autophagy only is maintained at juvenile levels in caloric restricted rats (donati
et al., 2001b).
many studies are consistent with the notion that mitochondrial oxidative damage
is a consequence of aging and that caloric restriction’s eﬀect on increasing longevity
may be due in part to reducing that oxidative damage. weindruch et al. (1980)
reported that cr increases the eﬃciency of mitochondrial electron transport and
oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mouse mitochondria. in rats cr decreases
mitochondrial oxygen production at complex i and lowers mtdna oxidative damage
460
a. donati / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 455–470
(sanz et al., 2005). in addition, cr prevents oxidative damage induced by peroxi-
some proliferation in mouse liver (qu et al., 2000).
pieri et al. (1991) proposed that the anti-aging action of cr may be due to the
protection of the physiological properties of cellular membranes. indeed, cr has
been found to retard many of the age-associated alteration of cell membranes [e.g.
accumulation of dolichol (parentini et al., 2005)] which may be responsible for many
cellular function such as cell signal transduction.
recent evidence suggests that cr may exhibit its eﬀects to lifespan extension
partly through the reduced gh-igf-1 axis (bonkowski et al., 2006).
cr has been found to reduce plasma insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1)
and glucose concentrations. masoro et al. (1992) reported that cr increased glucose
eﬀectiveness or insulin responsiveness or both and proposed that the lifetime main-
tenance of low levels of glucose and markedly low levels of insulin played a major
role in the life extending and related actions of cr.
sonntag et al. (1992) showed that igf-1 plasma levels were markedly lower in
rats and mice submitted to caloric restriction. in addition gh-igf1 deﬁcient dwarf
mice were found to exhibit life extension (brown-borg et al., 1996; bartke et al.,
2001; flurkey et al., 2001).
a rapidly growing body of evidence show that insulin-igf signaling pathway is
causally linked to aging across taxa (bartke, 2001). the loss of function mutations
of insulin-like signaling system result in life extension in caenorhabditis elegans
(kenyon et al., 1993) and drosophila melanogaster (clancy et al., 2001; tatar
et al., 2001). nematodes and fruit ﬂies do not have separate receptors for insulin
and igf1, whereas mammals, during evolution developed two separate hormonal
systems. heterozigous knock-out mice for the igf1 receptor live 26% longer than
the wild type (holzenberger et al., 2003). bluher et al. (2003) reported that mice in
which the insulin receptor is ‘‘knocked out’’ only in the adipose tissue exhibits life
extension and decreased body mass.
since there is no clear evidence that changes in insulin and igf1 levels may cause
any acute increase in oxidative stress or other type of damage, it is conceivable that
the pro-aging eﬀect of hormones might be secondary to inhibition of macroauto-
phagy and cell-repair function. indeed, in vivo macroautophagy is inhibited by high
levels of insulin (del roso et al., 2003); igf1 may act by the same mechanism: we
have found recently that it may suppress autophagic proteolysis in isolated liver cells
incubated in vitro (unpublished). similar results were obtained by gu et al. (2004) on
cultured cells.
4. macroautophagy in aging and anti-aging intervention
function of macroautophagy declines with increasing age. by the use of a per-
fused rat liver preparation with no added amino acid, ward reported that the max-
imum rate of macroautophagic degradation of long-lived protein is paramount by
age 6 months and then shows a signiﬁcant and progressive age-related decline
(ward, 1988).
a. donati / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 455–470
461
similar data were obtained with isolated rat liver cells by donati et al. (2001a).
these authors showed that changes in regulation of macroautophagic proteolysis
by the addition of amino acid in the incubation medium paralleled the decline in
the maximum rate of proteolysis, whereas sensitivity to insulin and glucagon decline
dramatically (bergamini et al., 2004a).
on the other hand, experiments with overnight-fasted rats and in vivo induction
of macroautophagy by the injection of an anti-lipolytic drug (del roso et al., 2003)
showed that regulation of macroautophagy is impaired dramatically at a very early
age: the macroautophagic proteolysis response of the perfused liver decreased
remarkably between ages 2 and 6 months and was almost negligible at older ages.
electron microscopy evidence was obtained that the rate of formation rate and of
the elimination of autophagic vacuoles decrease in older liver cells (pollera et al.,
1990; bergamini and kovacs, 1990; terman, 1995). data may give support to the
hypothesis that the increase in amino acid and insulin levels by ad libitum feeding
may suppress functioning of macroautophagy and membranes and cell organelles
maintenance at a very young age; thus, dysregulation of macroautophagy might
be the consequence of age-related decline in the in vivo functioning of macroauto-
phagy itself.
lysosomes function too may play a role in the aging-related decline in macro-
autophagic proteolysis. lysosomes of postmitotic cells gradually accumulate an
undegradable, polymeric material called lipofuscin or age pigment which probably
represents a product of oxidative attack on proteins and lipids. it was hypothesized
(terman and brunk, 2004) that lipofuscin accumulation may greatly diminish lyso-
somal degradative capacity by preventing lysosomal enzyme from targeting to func-
tional autophagosomes. furthermore, the age-related decline of macroautophagy
also correlates with increase of membrane lipid dolichol in all rodent tissues, indicat-
ing a probable alteration in membrane functions and transmembrane signaling
(marino et al., 1997, 1998).
by a diﬀerent experimental approach, with a loss-of function mutation in the insu-
lin-like signaling, melendez et al. (2003) showed that macroautophagy genes are
essential for lifespan extension in c. elegans. disruption of macroautophagy gene
apg7-1 makes arabidopsis thaliana hypersensitive to nutrient limiting conditions
and displays premature leaf senescence (doelling et al., 2002).
caloric restriction can protect from the age-dependent impairment of macroauto-
phagy. ward (1988) showed that caloric restriction produced a greater levels of max-
imum rate of liver macroautophagic proteolysis at any age from 6 months on. with
older isolated liver cells, caloric restriction was shown to prevent both the decline in
maximum rate of macroautophagic proteolysis and the changes in amino acid and
hormones regulation (donati et al., 2001b). furthermore, caloric restriction prevents
the early age-dependent decrease in the in vivo induction of macroautophagy (del
roso et al., 2003). it has been reported that the beneﬁcial eﬀects of caloric restriction
on liver macroautophagy correlate with eﬀects on life-expectancy and depend on
duration and intensity of the treatment (cavallini et al., 2001). these ﬁndings may
support the hypothesis that macroautophagy is involved in the anti-aging mecha-
nism of caloric restriction.

5. macroautophagy as an anti-aging cell mechanism
macroautophagy may be involved in preventing the ‘‘waste’’ accumulation within
cells by its eﬀective function on the turnover of cell components and disposal of dam-
aged protein or organelles. if stimulated eﬀectively, this cell housekeeping function
may prevent any age-related physiological decline [e.g. immunosenescence (cuervo
et al., 2005)] and pathologies [e.g. neurodegenerative diseases (komatsu et al.,
2006)].
5.1. protein
it is now generally accepted that protein degradation declines with age (ward,
1988, 2002). the drastic increase in half-life during aging (e.g. sharma et al.,
1979; prasanna and lane, 1979) may increase chances of protein molecules to
undergo posttranslational modiﬁcation (ryazanov and nefsky, 2002). two major
mechanisms are involved in protein degradation: the proteasome system, which is
responsible for the degradation of short-lived and damaged protein and macro-
autophagy, which is involved in degradation of long-lived proteins (mortimore
et al., 1989). proteasomal proteolysis may not decrease (ward, 2002) whereas
autophagic proteolysis decreases remarkably with increasing age (reviewed in
cuervo et al., 2005). in liver cells, the age-related accumulation of protein car-
bonyl derivatives correlates temporally with the decline in macroautophagic pro-
teolysis; anti-aging caloric restriction prevents the age-related accumulation of
damaged protein, and decline in macroautophagic proteolysis, and has no eﬀect
on proteasomal activity (vittorini et al., 1999). perhaps, the dramatic age-depen-
dent
impairment of autophagic proteolysis may overload the extralysosomal
machinery, thus causing failure and accumulation of altered proteins in liver cells.
furthermore, altered proteins may aggregate to form aggresomes. macroauto-
impairment may be involved in
phagy is responsible for aggresome disposal:
the accumulation of aggresomes
(ravikumar
et al., 2002; fortun et al., 2003).
in neurodegenerative diseases
5.2. mitochondria
it is well known that mitochondria are degraded via a form of macroautophagy
which has been named mitophagy (lemasters, 2005). mitochondria are frequently
encountered within autophagic vacuoles at the electron microscopy observation
(klionsky and emr, 2000). older cells are lower in autophagy and are known to
accumulate altered mitochondria that are rich in mutated mtdna (wei et al.,
1998). somatic mutation may be a primary cause of mitochondrial functional decline
and of ros hyper-production (miquel et al., 1980). evidence with genetically mod-
iﬁed yeast (jin, 2006) and mice (komatsu et al., 2005) support the hypothesis that an
age-related decrease in macroautophagy may promote accumulation of damaged
mitochondria. mitophagy may be a selective process that aﬀects dysfunctional mito-
chondria only (jin, 2006; lemasters, 2005).
a. donati / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 455–470
463
it may be interesting to mention here that caloric restriction (sanz et al., 2005)
and stimulation of macroautophagy (gu et al., 2004) can prevent accumulation of
altered mitochondria in older cells.
accumulation of damaged mitochondria and biological garbage (for example, lip-
ofuscin in lysosomes) caused by decline in macroautophagy may be part of a vicious
cycle leading to a further impairment of autophagic function and accumulation of
altered mitochondria (brunk and terman, 2002).
5.3. peroxisomes
peroxisomes are degraded by the autophagic machinery both in yeast (veenhuis
et al., 1983) and in mammals (locci-cubeddu et al., 1985; iwata et al., 2006). process
was named pexophagy: both pexophagy and mitophagy are induced by stimuli that
mimic a severe nutrient deprivation (locci-cubeddu et al., 1985). pexophagy may be
involved both in the degradation of excess peroxisomes when nutritional substrates
are changed, and in the selective degradation of abnormal peroxisomes in cells from
patients with zellweger disease (heikoop et al., 1992). a decline in peroxisome turnover
rate with age may increase oxidative stress and alterate membrane lipid composition.
5.4. cytomembranes
the aging-related decline of macroautophagy in ad libitum fed rats may be asso-
ciated with deterioration of cell membranes. a signiﬁcant accumulation of the mem-
brane lipid dolichol was seen in rat tissues after age 6 months (cavallini et al., 2003;
kalen et al., 1989; marino et al., 1998); the aging-related accumulation of dolichol
was signiﬁcantly retarded by calorie restriction (cavallini et al., 2003; marino
et al., 1998); retardation correlated with the eﬀect on life-expectancy and on the func-
tion of macroautophagic proteolysis (cavallini et al., 2001, 2002; dolﬁ et al., 2003).
the accumulation of dolichol in older tissues may reﬂect an age-related derangement
of free radicals metabolism in membranes (bergamini et al., 2004b). ros are phys-
iologically important mediators in biological signaling (droge, 2003), and their con-
stitutive alteration in older cell membranes may be associated with dysregulation of
cell signaling (yeo and park, 2002; yoon et al., 2002); perhaps oxidized lipids and
their electrophilic decomposition products may directly modify signal transduction
proteins (levonen et al., 2004). ten years ago, a signal transduction theory of aging
was proposed (bergamini and gori, 1995).
6. pharmacological anti-aging interventions by the stimulation of macroautophagy
6.1. pharmacological intensiﬁcation of suppression of aging (pisa) by stimulation of
macroautophagy
the administration of an anti-lipolytic agent to fasting rats causes a sudden
decline of free fatty acids and glucose and an increase in the glucagon/insulin
464
a. donati / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 455–470
ratio leading to an intensiﬁcation of autophagic proteolysis, as shown by an
increase in liver autophagic compartment and a release of valine in plasma
(pollera et al., 1990; bergamini and kovacs, 1990; bergamini et al., 1993).
treatment increases the expression of lc3, a well known marker of autophago-
somes (donati et al., in press). this defense mechanism against nutrient depri-
vation provides a convenient
(i.e. a safe, highly reproducible and timable)
to study the eﬀects of hormone (low insulin-high gluca-
physiologic model
gon)-induced macroautophagy in liver cells (bergamini et al., 1993; bergamini
et al., 1993). treatment causes a signiﬁcant degradation of selected liver cell
organelles including peroxisomes and, to a minor extent, mitochondria (locci-
cubeddu et al., 1985). very recent results show that treatment can rescue older
from the age-related accumulation of oxidative damage in the
liver cells
mtdna in less than 6 h (donati et al.,
in press). these latter results invite
to conclude that the age-related changes in mtdna and function are a likely
consequence of an age-dependent failure in the regulation of macroautophagy,
impairing recognition and/or disposal of a small number of severely injured
mitochondria.
a life-long pharmacological stimulation of macroautophagy can intensify the
anti-aging eﬀect of caloric restriction. for instance, a life-long weekly treatment with
anti-lipolytic agents may enhance the beneﬁcial eﬀects of a mild (10%, fasting 1-day-
a-week) calorie restriction on two parameters that are known to correlate with life-
expectancy: the age-related changes in liver macroautophagy and the accumulation
of dolichol in the liver tissue (donati et al., 2004). in conclusion, a way was found to
pharmacologically intensify the beneﬁcial eﬀects of a mild dietary restriction in
humans (bergamini et al., 2004a).
6.2. stimulation of macroautophagy by the administration of the mtor (mammalian
target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin
it is well-known that tor pathway signalling play a central role in inhibiting
macroautophagy in response to nutrients, especially amino acids (abeliovich,
2003). administration of the antibiotic rapamycin to eukaryotic cells results in
physiological responses that mimic nutrient starvation and activate autophagy
(abeliovich, 2003). data show that decreased tor signaling by genetic disrup-
tion or pharmacological inhibition extend chronological lifespan in saccaromyces
cerevisiae (powers et al., 2006) and in c. elegans (vellai et al., 2003) and may pre-
vent neurodegeneration in a mouse model of huntington disease (ravikumar
et al., 2004). in addition decreased tor signaling may be responsible for the
extension of lifespan in d. melanogaster fed an amino acid deﬁcient diet (min
and tatar, 2006).

7. conclusion
data support the hypothesis that macroautophagy has a major role in the retar-
dation of the aging process by anti-aging interventions. according to this hypothesis,
ad libitum feeding may inhibit, and caloric restriction and disruption of insulin-like
signaling may intensify, macroautophagy throughout the life. data with the pisa
model show that safe pharmacological procedure are available to intensify the pro-
cess (fig. 1).
