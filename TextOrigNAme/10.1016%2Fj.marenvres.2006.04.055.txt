abstract
this conceptual paper addresses the role of lysosomal autophagy in cellular defence against oxi-
dative stress. a hypothesis is proposed that autophagic removal of oxidatively damaged organelles
and proteins provides a second tier of defence against oxidative stress. age pigment or lipofuscin is a
product of oxidative attack on proteins and lipids and can accumulate in lysosomes, where it can
generate reactive oxygen species (ros) and inhibit lysosomal function, resulting in autophagic fail-
ure. it is further hypothesised that repeated triggering of augmented autophagy can protectively min-
imise lipofuscin generation; and that animals living in ﬂuctuating environments, where autophagy is
repeatedly stimulated by natural stressors, will be generically more tolerant of pollutant stress. data
for resistance to pollutant stress is presented, together with evidence for a correlation between lyso-
somal stability and macrobenthic diversity. finally, we speculate that organisms making up func-
tional ecological assemblages in ﬂuctuating environments, where up-regulation of autophagy
should provide a selective advantage, may be pre-selected to be tolerant of pollutant-induced oxida-
tive stress.

autophagy is the degradation of cellular components in lysosomes and is implicated in
many disease processes, cell death and adaptive responses (cuervo, 2004; levine, 2005).
this group of at least three related processes (i.e., macro- and micro-autophagy and chap-
eronin-mediated autophagy) is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis (cuervo,
2004), and morphological evidence has long indicated that lysosomal autophagy is a

in the continuous
highly conserved mechanism evolutionarily (cuervo, 2004). while the genes for autophagy
were initially discovered in yeast, analogues of those genes are now being found in diverse
groups of animals including nematode worms, fruit-ﬂies and mammals (cuervo, 2004).
damaged cellular constituents and redundant products are removed by lysosomal autoph-
agy, but it is also critically involved, along with other proteolytic systems (e.g. protea-
somes),
intracellular components. autophagy is
up-regulated in times of stress or physiological change: by breaking down longer-lived
proteins and organelles, and recycling the products into protein-synthesis and energy-pro-
duction pathways, the process allows cells to be temporarily self-sustaining during periods
when nutrients are restricted (bergamini et al., 2003; cuervo, 2004; levine, 2005). in this
paper we consider the role of lysosomal autophagy as a protective system against the con-
sequences of oxidative stress, and discuss its signiﬁcance in the development of tolerance in
aquatic ecosystems.
turnover of
autophagy is often considered to be primarily a survival strategy in multicellular
organisms, which either is initiated by stressors (e.g., restricted nutrients, hyperthermia,
hypoxia and salinity increase; moore et al., 2006a). however, recent evidence indicates
that autophagy is much more than just a survival process and is, in fact, intimately
involved in cell physiology (cuervo, 2004; lockshin and zakeri, 2004; moore, 1988,
2004; moore et al., 2006a). augmented autophagy is apparently controlled by switching
oﬀ the mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase: mtor signalling is involved in
many aspects of cell growth-regulation and has also been implicated in some cancers
(fig. 1; levine, 2005). mtor is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and has been var-
iously described in yeast, nematodes, molluscs, insects, crustaceans, birds and mammals
(cammalleri et al., 2003; beaumont et al., 2001; levine, 2005; klionsky and emr,
2000). this signalling system is classically switched oﬀ by nutrient deprivation and
hypoxia, with resultant up-regulation of autophagy which has been described in mussels
and snails (bayne et al., 1978; moore and halton, 1973; moore et al., 1979, 1985).
in eukaryotic cells, the ﬁrst tier of defence against oxidative damage is provided by
xenobiotic transporters, biotransformation enzymes and anti-oxidant protection enzymes,
like superoxide dismutase and catalase (livingstone, 2001; moore et al., 2004). lysosomal
autophagy provides a second line of defence, by removing oxidatively damaged proteins,
and impaired organelles and even portions of the nucleus and dna (bergamini et al.,
2003; cuervo, 2004; fig. 1). consequently, when the ﬁrst line of defensive systems is over-
come, autophagy protects the cell against the harmful eﬀects of damaged and malfunction-
ing proteins, which can form aggregates that will accumulate irreversibly in cells (grune
et al., 2004; moore, 2004; figs. 1 and 2a). autophagy may also serve as a third tier of
defence: when autophagic capabilities are compromised, autophagic processes can contrib-
ute to all three types of cell death (i.e., type 1 – apoptotic; type 2 – autophagic; and type
3 – necrotic; lockshin and zakeri, 2004) to remove irreversibly damaged cells in order to
maintain organ integrity (pipe and moore, 1986a; fig. 2). there also appear to be molec-
ular cross-talk with crossover points in the pathways leading to all three forms of cell
death (lockshin and zakeri, 2004).
pollutant exposure often causes oxidative attack on the protein machinery and organ-
elles of the cell (livingstone, 2001; fig. 1). an eﬀective ability to up-regulate the autopha-
gic process will obviously be advantageous to organisms exposed to pollutants, since this
will facilitate the removal of damaged cellular constituents and conserve cell function
(cuervo, 2004; kirchin et al., 1992; lockshin and zakeri, 2004; figs. 1 and 2a); and also

reactive oxygen species (ros) contribute to the formation of lipofuscin, a type of protein aggregate, which is
currently believed to produce further ros and inhibit enzymic breakdown of autophagocytosed cellular
constituents. it is proposed that repeated stimulation of enhanced autophagy by various environmental stimuli,
including certain stressors, will result in a more eﬀective recycling of cellular materials, consequently reducing
lipofuscin formation and protecting the cell from oxidative attack. adapted from brunk and terman (2002) and

reduce the amount of age-pigment (lipofuscin) produced (grune et al., 2004; fig. 1). lip-
ofuscin accumulates in lysosomes as a result of peroxidation of autophagocytosed proteins
associated with protein aggregates and oxidatively damaged organelles (fig. 1), and was
previously considered to be just cellular junk (grune et al., 2004). however, new evidence
indicates that lipofuscin binds iron, which generates reactive oxygen species (ros), result-
ing in exacerbation of oxidative damage (brunk and terman, 2002). brunk and terman
(2002) also hypothesise that lipofuscin binds lysosomal hydrolases, thereby inhibiting pro-
tein degradation. the outcome is ‘‘failed autophagy’’ with autophagic accumulation of
essentially undegradable damaged organelles, proteins, phospholipids and lipids contrib-
uting to further lipofuscin formation (brunk and terman, 2002; krishnakumar et al.,
1994; moore, 1988; moore et al., 2006a; fig. 1).
failed autophagy has been observed in molluscs, ﬁsh and mammals exposed to pollu-
tants (allen and moore, 2004; moore, 1988; moore et al., 2004, 2006a). reports on other
animals tend to be largely descriptive, so systematic observations of other phyletic groups
would be beneﬁcial to the development of a generic understanding of the role of autoph-
agy in ameliorating the harmful eﬀects of pollutants.
since autophagy is one of the most highly evolutionarily conserved molecular processes
in the eukaryotes (cuervo, 2004; klionsky and emr, 2000), it is hypothesised that up-reg-

degradation acts as a second tier of defence against oxidative stress; and possibly as a third tier when autophagic
capabilities are compromised and the autophagic system may trigger cell death (i.e., apoptotic – type i,
autophagic – type ii or necrotic – type iii) for removal of irreversibly damaged cells. lysosomal stability is used
here as an integrated indicator of cellular wellbeing, that can be used as a generic yard-stick for interpreting the
responses of many biomarkers (allen and moore, 2004; moore et al., 2004, 2006a). (b) macrofaunal diversity
and lysosomal stability (mean ± 95% cl, n = 10) in mussel hepatopancreatic digestive cells from 4 sites (1–4),
sampled along a pollutant gradient in norway (indicated by rpahs in mussels) shows that mussels from the most
contaminated site 4 are more similar to the cleanest mussels at site 1 than are mussels from sites 2 and 3.
macrofaunal diversity h0 (mean ± 95% cl, n = 4) was measured at adjacent sites. (c) lysosomal stability is
directly correlated with macrofaunal diversity. diversity data is derived from gray et al. (1988) and moore
(1988).

ulation of this system may play a signiﬁcant role in adaptation to environments where oxi-
dative stress is a major selection pressure, and where the facility to rapidly delete and
recycle oxidatively damaged proteins and organelles will provide an evolutionary advan-
tage. estuarine and coastal environments, where ﬂuctuating salinity, nutrient, temperature
and oxygen regimes are all important selective drivers and also inducers of autophagy, are
likely to be areas where it would be an adaptive advantage to be able to minimise the
eﬀects of oxidative stress. furthermore, due to the fact that nearshore and estuarine envi-
ronments are those most likely to be subjected to anthropogenic stress; we have a scenario
where eﬀective anti-oxidant protection may provide an evolutionary advantage. conse-
quently, we would expect to observe functional ecological groupings of organisms in
coastal and estuarine environments that have generic and highly eﬀective ﬁrst- and sec-
ond-tier defensive systems for dealing with oxidative stress. the corollary of this is that
an ability for rapid up-regulation of autophagy is a probable necessity for acquisition
of tolerance in high stress environmental scenarios. many molluscs have such a capability
for augmented autophagy, including mussels and marine and terrestrial snails (bayne
et al., 1978; lowe et al., 1981; marigomez et al., 2005; moore, 2004; moore and halton,
1973; moore et al., 1985, 1986, 2006a; pipe and moore, 1986b). augmented autophagy
induced by short term starvation has a protective eﬀect against copper and phenanthrene
mediated oxidative stress in mussels (moore, 2004; moore et al., 2006b). further support
comes from a study of blue mussels from a highly contaminated site in norway which
showed evidence of tolerance, in comparison with less contaminated mussels (moore,
1988; fig. 2b). samples from four sites along a pollution gradient showed that mussels
from site 4 were the most contaminated, although lysosomal stability in these mussels indi-
cated that they were more similar to the cleanest site 1, than were animals from sites 2 and
3 (fig. 2b). although these mussels had relatively high lysosomal stability, they showed
clear evidence of autophagy, placing them in tier 2, whereas mussels from sites 2 and 3
with low stability were clearly in tier 3 (fig. 2a and b; moore, 1988). the inference here
is that up-regulated autophagy may have been selected in this population (moore, 1988).
lysosomal stability was also strongly correlated with macrobenthic diversity (h0) in spa-
tially adjacent sites (fig. 2c; r = 0.946, p < 0.01); and although these are just correla-
tions, they may be a reﬂection of the universality of autophagic reactions to stress.
in addition to studies of single populations and species, many studies have examined
changes in the structure of communities along marine pollution gradients (fig. 2b).
indeed, this is a standard component of most pollution monitoring schemes. one common
ﬁnding is that responses are often manifest at taxonomic levels higher than species, com-
monly as high as phyla (olsgard et al., 1998). organisms within diﬀerent phyla are consid-
ered to have diﬀerent sensitivities to stress (warwick and clarke, 1993), raising the
interesting possibility that this reﬂects long-established evolutionary diﬀerences in the
physiology of organisms within diﬀerent phyla. while autophagic mechanisms are highly
conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesise that ability to up-regulate this process varies
among phyla, and this underlies diﬀerences in their ability to colonise parts of the coastal
and estuarine environment, and also contributes to their diﬀerential sensitivities to anthro-
pogenic stress. we propose that representative organisms from a range of phyla making up
functional ecological assemblages are assessed to determine the extent to which their rel-
ative capabilities for up-regulation of autophagy and the degradative (retrograde) compo-
nent of protein turnover contribute to their ability to survive natural and anthropogenic
stress.

in conclusion, lysosomal autophagy appears to provide a second line of defence against
oxidative stress, and the capability to eﬀectively up-regulate this process is probably a sig-
niﬁcant factor contributing to the ability of some organisms to tolerate stressful and pol-
luted environments.
