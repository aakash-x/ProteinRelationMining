abstract
autophagy, a process involved in the degradation and the recycling of long-lived proteins and organelles to survive nitrogen starvation, is
generally non-selective. however, recent data suggest that selective forms of autophagy exist, that are able to specifically target several
organelles, including mitochondria. conversely, mitochondrial alterations could trigger autophagy. such a selective form of autophagy might be
involved in the elimination of damaged mitochondria. we reported previously that, mitochondria were early targets of rapamycin-induced
autophagy. here we report that rapamycin-induced autophagy is accompanied by the early production of reactive oxygen species and by the
early oxidation of mitochondrial lipid. inhibition of these oxidative effects by resveratrol largely impaired autophagy of both cytosolic proteins
and mitochondria, and delayed subsequent cell death. these results support a role of mitochondrial oxidation events in the activation of
autophagy.

autophagy is a general intracellular degradation process
playing a crucial role in survival to nitrogen starvation in yeast
[1,2 for reviews], plants [3, for review], cultured animal cells
[4, for review] and in the whole animals [5,6]. it has been
particularly well characterized in the yeast saccharomyces
cerevisiae, from genetic screens based on the sensitivity to
nitrogen starvation [1,2,7 for reviews]. the main process of
autophagy is known as macroautophagy.

formation of double-membrane vesicles, named autophago-
somes that engulf and deliver cytosolic material
to the
vacuoles. a similar process occurs in mammalian cells,
where autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes,
then forming
autolysosomes [4]. although macroautophagy is generally a
non-selective process (i.e. engulfed material can virtually be
anything and is randomly sequestered), selective processes
have been described for
the degradation of peroxisomes
(pexophagy) in the methylotrophic yeasts pichia pastoris [8],
hansenula polymorpha [9] and in saccharomyces cerevisiae
[10, for review] and in mammals [11, for review]. besides
macroautophagy, another form of autophagy, called micro-
autophagy, involves the direct engulfment of portions of the
cytoplasm by invaginations of the vacuole, by a molecular
mechanism that
remains unclear. like macroautophagy,
microautophagy is generally non-selective. however, a
particular form of microautophagy, piecemeal microautophagy
of the nucleus (pmn), has been described in s.cerevisiae [12].
also, the existence of a selective form of microautophagy of
the peroxisomes (micropexophagy) has been reported in
yeasts [13].

the main physiological role of autophagy is the recycling of
amino acids from proteins for survival to nitrogen starvation.
however, it has also been proposed that autophagy could play a
role in several forms of programmed cell death. in mammalian
cells, autophagy is often associated to apoptosis but the actual
role of autophagy in cell death is discussed [14,15]. in plants,
autophagic cell death has been shown to be associated to the
hypersensitive response to pathogens [16]. recent data support
that selective forms of autophagy might exist and be involved
in cellular maintenance, by eliminating altered components.
this might be particularly true for organelles, such as mito-
chondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, which are particularly
exposed to oxidation because of the presence of electron ca-
rriers [17–22]. a recent work supports that selective autophagy
of the endoplasmic reticulum exists in yeast [23]. concerning
mitochondria, we have identified the gene uth1, encoding an
outer mitochondrial membrane protein, of which the absence
impaired the autophagy of mitochondria but not the autophagy
of cytosolic proteins [24–27]. the product of uth1 was
therefore the first identified protein involved in mitochondria-
autophagy but not in general autophagy, suggesting that the
regulations of the two processes were, at least partially, distinct.
the process of mitochondria-autophagy has been termed
mitophagy [22,28].
them at
the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) is a normal
side-consequence of the functioning of the respiratory chain
[29,30, for reviews]) and of several other reactions, namely
those involved in lipid metabolism [29,31,32, for reviews].
their destructive effects on biological molecules, such as lipids,
proteins and nucleic acids, has put
the centre of
numerous pathologies including cardiovascular diseases, can-
cers and ageing [33,34, for reviews]. ros have been shown to
modulate apoptotic programmed cell death in mammalian cells
[32,35,36, for reviews] and are the main trigger of apoptosis-
like cell death in yeast [37]. besides their regulatory effect of
apoptosis, ros might play a role in the regulation of autophagy
[38,39]. this might be particularly relevant to the targeting of
mitochondria and of endoplasmic reticulum,
the two main
locations for ros-production. this would also be relevant to
the putative selective elimination of altered mitochondria as a
weapon against ageing [22,33].
in the present work, we observed that rapamycin-treatment
lipid
induced an early ros-production and mitochondrial
oxidation that could be inhibited by the hydrophobic antioxi-
dant resveratrol. further, resveratrol-treatment was able to
impair autophagy of both cytosolic proteins and mitochondria
and delayed rapamycin-induced cell death, suggesting that
mitochondrial oxidation events play a crucial role in the
regulation of autophagy.
experimental procedures
strains and cultures
the wild-type parental strain w303-1b (mat a, ade1, his3,
leu2, trp1, ura3) was used in this study. for the measurement of
alkaline phosphatase activity, the pho8 locus was replaced
with the construct pho8δ60 by transformation with a hind iii
fragment of the plasmid ptn9 [40] (gift from y. ohsumi, nibb
okazaki, japan) as described previously [24]. for fluorescent
microscopy experiments, cells were transformed with the
plasmid pgal-clbgfp containing the presequence of mito-
chondrial citrate synthase fused to the n-terminus of jellyfish
green fluorescent protein (mtgfp) [41], under the control of a
galactose-inducible gal1/10 promoter, as described previously
[24].
cells were grown aerobically in minimal medium (ynb)
(0.175% yeast nitrogen base (difco), 0.1% potassium phos-
phate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% drop-mix, ph 5.5)
supplemented with 2% lactate and the adequate auxotrophic
requirements. for mtgfp- expression under the control of the
gal1/10 promoter, 1% galactose was added to the medium.
0.2 μg/ml rapamycin (lc laboratories) solubilized in 90%
ethanol/10% triton x-100 or in dimethylformamide was added
for the induction of autophagy.
plating efficiency
viability of cells was determined as the plating efficiency.
cells were grown in liquid culture and treated with
rapamycin. at indicated times, cells were counted, diluted,
and aliquots with identical number of cells (5 × 102) were
plated on solid complete ypd medium without rapamycin
(1% yeast extract, 1% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, ph 5.5).
only cells surviving rapamycin-treatment are able to form
colonies. the number of colonies was scored after 2–3 days
of growth at 28°c. the viability of cells was expressed as the
percentage of colonies produced by plating aliquots of non-
treated culture.
alkaline phosphatase assay
alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity was measured with
α-naphtyl phosphate (sigma) as a substrate and performed as
described previously [24]. fluorescence intensity was measured
at 472 nm (excitation at 345 nm) in a xenius spectrofluorimeter
(safas). protein concentration was measured with the lowry
method in each sample and the activity was expressed as units
per minute per milligram proteins (u/min/mg).
fluorescence microscopy
mtgfp-expressing cells were visualized on a leica micro-
systems dm-lb fluorescence microscope. the images were
acquired with a sis camera.
ros measurement
aliquots of cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for
10 minutes under agitation in the presence of 20 μm
dihydrorhodamine 123 (sigma). following oxidation by ros,
non- fluorescent dihyhydrorhodamine 123 is converted to
fluorescent rhodamine 123. fluorescence was measured in a
galaxy flow cytometer (partec). when used, n-acetylcysteine

(5 mm) and resveratrol (sigma; 100 μm) were added as
solutions in water and ethanol, respectively.
lipid oxidation
the extent of lipid oxidation was measured as the amount of
thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (tbars) on cells grown in
the presence of 100 μm c18:2. aliquots of 5 × 107 cells were
washed and resuspended in 0.1 ml water and added with 1 ml
of a freshly prepared solution of 0.375% thiobarbituric acid
dissolved in 12% trichloroacetic acid and 0.5 m hydrochloric
acid. after a 15 minutes-incubation at 90°c and a centrifuga-
tion, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 535 nm
and compared to that of a range of solutions of 1,1,3,3,-
tetramethoxypropane treated under the same conditions.
lipid analysis
mitochondria were isolated by a standard procedure by
digestion of the cell wall with zymolyase and differential
centrifugation [42]. lipid extraction, separation of phospholi-
pids and fatty acids analyses were done as previously described
[43]. each sample was measured in triplicate and experiments
were reproduced twice.
statistical analyses
statistical analyses were done with prism 2.01 software,
using paired t-test, unpaired t-test or contengency test.

measured as indicated in the methods section. data are means (±sd) of three

respectively. statistical analysis of
early increase of the production of reactive oxygen species
(ros) (fig. 1). scavenging of superoxide ion by the water-
soluble antioxidant n-acetylcysteine only slightly decreased
rapamycin-associated oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 to
rhodamine 123; on the opposite, addition of the hydrophobic
antioxidant resveratrol had a strong inhibitory effect on the
oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 (fig. 1). other widely used
antioxidants gave similar results: water-soluble tiron (1 mm)
had no protective effect while hydrophobic α-tocopherol
(200 μm) was as efficient as resveratrol (data not shown).
these different effects of water-soluble and hydrophobic anti-
oxidant molecules might be related to the capacity of the laters
to protect more efficiently membrane lipid than the formers.
this protective effect of resveratrol was confirmed by
measuring the production of the side product of lipid oxidation,
malonaldehyde, in cells grown in the presence of c18:2. this
fatty acid can be incorporated in phospholipids and its oxidation
leads to the production of malonaldehyde that can be measured
by its reaction with thiobarbituric acid. although this reaction is

resveratrol (higher concentrations did not produce more effects). an aliquot of cells was incubated for 10 minutes with 20 μm dihydrorhodamine 123 before and after a
30-minutes rapamycin- treatment. fluorescence of rhodamine 123 was analyzed by flow cytometry. the vertical bar indicates a fluorescence value equal to 1 and

known to lack specificity, the sensitivity to resveratrol allowed
evaluating the part of the reaction linked to lipid oxidation.
from data reported in fig. 2, resveratrol-sensitive production of
thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (tbars) increased by 3 to
4-fold following rapamycin-treatment.
the effect of rapamycin on lipid from cells grown under
standard conditions (i.e. without
the addition of exogenous
polyunsaturated fatty acid) can be measured by the ratio of
saturated (c16:0 and c18:0) over monounsaturated (c16:1 and c18:1)
fatty acids: the oxidation of monounsaturated fatty acids does not
lead to the appearance of detectable molecules by classical
methods such as tbars, but still leads to a decrease of the
unsaturation index (unsaturated/saturated ratio) [43,44]. rapamy-
cin-treatment induced both a decrease in the total amount of
mitochondrial fatty acids (from 225 ± 24 to 154 ± 13 μg/mg
protein) and a decrease of the unsaturation index of fatty acid (fig.
3). this rapamycin-induced alteration concerned all the phospho-
lipids except ps/pi/pa, which already have a low basal
unsaturation index.
effect of resveratrol on autophagy
non-selective autophagy can be measured through the
activation of a mutant form of the pho8-encoded vacuolar

expressing pho8δ60 were grown in the absence or in the presence of
100 μm resveratrol or 5 mm n- aectylcysteine, and treated with 0.2 μg/ml
rapamycin for 60 minutes before alp-activity measurement. each sample
was analyzed in triplicate and three sets of experiments were done.
statistical analyses: rapamycin + n-acetylcysteine v/s “rapamycin” p = 0.63,
“rapamycin + resveratrol” v/s “rapamycin” p < 0.05.

observed one hour after the addition of 0.2 μg/ml rapamycin. resveratrol did
not prevent the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, but prevented the

are associated to mitochondria dysfunctions, namely during the
ageing process [33,45, for reviews]) and mitochondria-associ-
ated pathologies [34, for review]. yeast cells are able to sort
altered mitochondria between mother and daughter cells on the
basis of protein oxidation [46]. mitochondrial ros have also
been proposed to act as signalling molecules able to switch
mammalian cells between differentiation and proliferation, in
relation to mitochondrial metabolism [47,48]. however, since
ros are soluble molecules that diffuse rapidly, they might not
be able to confer enough selectivity to the mitochondria
autophagy process.
indicating that
mitochondrial lipid oxidation is not only an indicator of
mitochondrial dysfunction but can also be a hallmark for altered
mitochondria since, opposite to ros, oxidized lipids are not
expected to diffuse rapidly throughout the cell, including to
other mitochondria, especially if the mitochondrial network is
fragmented, as it occurs early during autophagy ([24] and fig. 5
in this paper). the combination of mitochondria-fragmentation
and mitochondrial lipid oxidation might together be an adequate
signal
the autophagic machinery should be
activated. the fact that the inhibition of lipid oxidation by
resveratrol (and α- tocopherol) limits autophagy adds further
support to a crucial role of membrane lipid oxidation as a trigger
for the degradation of altered mitochondria. the poor prevent-
ing effect of n-acetylcysteine (and tiron) suggested that the role
of soluble ros in the signalling remained marginal. interest-
ingly, this correlates with previous observations showing that
the heterologous expression of mammalian pro-apoptotic
protein bax in yeast induced a cell death that coul be delayed
by both resveratrol and α-tocopherol but not by n-acetylcys-
teine and tiron [43].
recent data obtained on mammalian cells already supported
that oxidation events are a major positive regulator of
autophagy. catalase-inactivation induced an autophagic cell
death, protected by inhibitors of ros-production [39]. the
involvement of mitochondrial cardiolipin peroxidation in
autophagy-associated death has also been proposed for some
forms of neuronal programmed cell death [38]. it should be
noted, however, that, under acute oxidative conditions, the
intracellular degradation machinery might be turned from a
protective to a death-committing process [49]. the ability of
mitochondria to modulate this response might be crucial for the
fate of the cell.

alkaline phosphatase. a n-terminally truncated mutant of this
protein (pho8δ60p) cannot be targeted to the vacuole and
further activated, unless autophagy is triggered [40]. resvera-
trol-treatment
inhibited rapamycin-induced activation of
pho8δ60p (fig. 4) showing that lipid oxidation was a major
event in the activation of non-selective autophagy. on the other
hand, n-acetylcysteine had no effect.
mitochondria autophagy was followed in vivo by fluores-
cence microscopy of mitochondria- targeted gfp (mtgfp).
rapamycin-treatment of lactate-grown cells induced a rapid
degradation of mitochondria since mtgfp has a diffuse
distribution in about two-thirds of the cells (third row in fig.
5a and fig. 5b). the remaining cells contained fragmented
mitochondria (“grain” structures) and no cells contain unaltered
mitochondria (“thread” structure). the presence of resveratrol
did not prevent the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network,
but prevented the degradation of mitochondrial “grains”, which
remained fluorescent (fourth row in fig. 5a). from these data,
the inhibition of lipid oxidation did not prevent the initial
alteration of the mitochondrial network but did prevent the
further degradation of mitochondria. like resveratrol, α-
tocopherol had the same protective effect over the degradation
of mtgfp (data not shown).
although autophagy is normally a survival process,
its
overactivation by rapamycin leads to a loss of viability [24].
the inhibition of autophagic events by resveratrol actually
slowed down rapamycin-induced loss of viability, while n-
acetylcysteine had no effect (fig. 6).
discussion
the existence of an autophagic process targeting mitochon-
dria implies that a mitochondrial signal should be able, not only
to trigger this process, but also to “tag” altered mitochondria to
prevent the useless and energy-costing degradation/biosynthesis
cycle of healthy mitochondria. the production of ros and the
oxidation of biological molecules, namely lipids and proteins,
