abstract autophagy is a cellular process involved in the
degradation and turn-over of long-lived proteins and organelles,
which can be subjected to suppression or further induction in
response to different stimuli. according to its essential role in
cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been implicated in several
pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopa-
thies. more recently, autophagy has been described as a
mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against
intracellular bacteria and viruses. in this context, autophagy has
been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection
by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. this is
strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in
interferon (ifn) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy
regulation. however, several viruses have evolved strategies to
divert ifn-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own
benefit. this review provides an overview of the autophagic
process and its involvement in the infection by different viral
pathogens and of the connections existing between autophagy
and proteins involved in ifn signalling pathways.

has been implicated in several pathologies. two major path-
ways are involved in the degradation of macromolecules in
eukaryotes: the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and autophagy.
the former is involved in the constitutive degradation of short-
lived proteins, maintaining a continuous protein turn-over in the
cell [1]. autophagy, which literally means “to eat oneself”, is
necessary for the lysosomal degradation and recycling of
long-lived proteins and entire organelles [2]. this process has
been observed in all eukaryotes and is morphologically
identical in plants, yeasts and animals. autophagy can be
classified into at least three different types: macroautophagy,
812
j mol med (2007) 85:811–823
microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma).
the last one is the only autophagic process that
is not
conserved through evolution and exits only in higher
eukaryotes. the first cma substrate identified was ribonu-
clase a and a particular motif in this protein, kferq, was
shown necessary for its selective degradation. this motif is
recognised by the chaperone protein hsc70 and targeted to
lysosomal membranes where hsc70 interacts with the
lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a. the substrates
are then translocated to the lysosomal lumen where they are
degraded. it is now known that all the cma substrates contain
a kferk-like motif, which is recognised by the hsc70. this
motif is composed of a basic (k, r), an acidic (d, e), a
hydrophobic (f, i, l, v), and another basic or hydrophobic
amino acid and is flanked by a q on either side [3].
microautophagy is characterised by the invagination of the
lysosomal membrane that sequesters cytoplasmic constituents
and, subsequently, degradation of the sequestered material.
macroautophagy is the major lysosomal route for the turnover
of cytoplasmic constituents, and will hereafter be referred as
autophagy. this process begins with an engulfment event of
portions of the cytosol into a characteristic double-membrane
vacuole, called the autophagosome. after maturation, auto-
phagosomes fuse with lysosomes for the degradation of the
sequestered material by lysosomal hydrolases. this last event
allows the recycling of the degraded constituents [4, 5].
autophagy is a highly regulated mechanism involving
specific genes called atg (autophagy-related genes). al-
though this process has been identified for more than
40 years, the first understandings of its molecular mecha-
nisms dated from about 10 years, with the discovery of atg
genes in yeast and orthologs in humans [6]. interestingly, it
the ubiquitin/proteasome
has been shown recently that
pathway and autophagy are connected.
indeed, atg7
knock-out mice present an accumulation of ubiquitinated
aggregates. this observation suggests that, in addition to
the proteasome pathway, ubiquitinated proteins can be
removed by autophagy [7]. moreover, it may also reflect
a compensatory mechanism in the absence of autophagy.
even if the origin of the lipids that compose autophago-
somes has been an aspect extensively studied since the
discovery of autophagy, this question is still hotly debated
[8]. the first studies provided evidence that the source of
autophagosomal membranes was both the golgi and the
endoplasmic reticulum and, at present,
the endoplasmic
reticulum is the most probable one [9]. another possibility
is that the membranes are unique or formed de novo [10].
thus, it has been proposed that, in mammals, autophago-
somes derived from a unique membrane of unknown origin,
called the phagophore. furthermore, a novel structure
necessary for autophagosome formation, called the pre-
autophagosomal structure (pas), has been identified in
yeast [11].
according to its essential role in cellular homeostasis,
autophagy has been implicated in several pathologies
including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopathies [12].
more recently, autophagy has been described as a mecha-
nism of innate immunity against
intracellular pathogens
[13], and its implication in major histocompatibility
complex (mhc) class ii antigen presentation extends its
function in adaptive immunity [13–15]. the term immu-
nophagy has recently been proposed by deretic [13] for the
specialised role of autophagy in immunity. a new field of
investigation is now emerging about the role of autophagy
in viral infections. besides its role as an intracellular host
defence pathway against viruses, autophagy can also be
used by the virus for its own profit to replicate more efficiently
in the cells, or to control cell survival [16]. the term
virophagy could be used to define the relationships that
exist between autophagy and viral infections. in this paper,
presented are the different molecular steps of the autophagic
process, its implication in both cell survival and cell death
and the relationships that are known between autophagy and
viral infections.

response to different stresses, starvation, specific hormones
or other stimuli [17–20]. the discovery of atg genes has
been essential
this
process. a major challenge in the autophagy field is now
to decipher the signalling pathways that act downstream the
initial autophagy induction signals. basically, the autopha-
gic process can be divided into different steps: activation,
autophagosome formation,
targeting to and fusion with
lysosomes and breakdown [21] (fig. 1).
in the molecular understanding of
activation
in mammalian cells,
the autophagic beclin 1 protein
(ortholog of yeast atg6) functions as part of a class iii
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) complex and plays a
crucial role in the early steps of autophagosome formation
[22, 23]. the mammalian class iii pi3k/beclin 1 complex
has its yeast counterpart that consists in the association of
vps34 (the ortholog of class iii pi3k) with the autophagic
proteins atg6 and atg14 [22]. the mammalian counterpart
of atg14 has not been identified so far. recent data suggest
that other proteins belong to this complex and thus regulate
the outcome of the signalling via class iii pi3k. indeed,

the eif-2α kinases are positive
regulators of autophagy in re-
sponse to starvation, er stress
and viral infection. autophagy
triggering is dependent on the
class iii pi3k signalling and on
two conjugation systems. first, a
pre-autophagosome is formed
and sequesters cytoplasmic ma-
terial. its completion leads to
autophagosome formation that
fuses with lysosome to form
autolysosome where the seques-
tered material is degraded
bcl-2 can negatively regulate the activation of autophagy
through its interaction with beclin 1 [24]. recently, an
activator of autophagy, called uvrag (uv irradiation
resistance-associated gene), has been identified to be part of
the pi3k/beclin 1 complex and to represent an important
signalling checkpoint in autophagy and tumour-cell growth
[25].
autophagosome formation
in general,
the autophagic process depends on two ubiquitin-like
conjugation systems essential for autophagosome formation
[26] (fig. 2).
three different enzymes are
required for the process of conjugation: an e1-activating
enzyme, an e2-conjugating enzyme and an e3 ligase
enzyme. the first conjugation system mediates formation
of the conjugate atg12/atg5. atg12 is activated by the e1-
like enzyme atg7, and then atg12 is transferred to the e2-
like enzyme atg10. finally, atg12 is covalently linked to a
specific lysine of atg5. no e3-like enzyme has been
discovered to date. then,
the conjugate atg12/atg5
interacts non-covalently with atg16l (atg16 in yeast) to
trigger homo-oligomerisation, leading to the formation of a
macromolecular complex of approximately 800 kda
(350 kda in yeast) necessary for
the formation of
autophagosomes. this structure is associated with the outer
side of the autophagosomes in formation and dissociates
from membranes before the autophagosome completion.
the second conjugation system is original because it
consists in the conjugation of a protein to a lipid, resulting
in the formation of the atg8/pe (phosphatidyl-ethanolamin)
the atg8 molecules present at
conjugate. atg8 is a soluble cytoplasmic protein that must
be first proteolysed by atg4 to enter the conjugation system.
after maturation by atg4, atg8 is activated by the e1-like
enzyme atg7, and then transferred to the e2-like enzyme
atg3. finally, atg8 is covalently linked to pe. this
conjugate is present in both sides of the autophagosomes
and seems fundamental for its completion. after autopha-
gosome completion,
the
cytoplasmic face of this structure are recycled after cleavage
by atg4 and the remaining atg8 proteins present in the inner
membrane of autophagosomes are degraded after fusion
with lysosomes. there are several orthologs of atg8 in
mammalian cells: map-lc3, gate-16 and gabarap,
each representing a different subfamily [27]. among these
proteins, map-lc3 is the best characterised one and
represents the most useful marker
for autophagosome
identification [28, 29]. in addition, there are four mamma-
lian orthologs of atg4, called autophagins, but only
autophagin 1 (also called hatg4b) cleaves specifically
atg8 and its different mammalian orthologs [30, 31].
interestingly, it appears that these two conjugation systems
are connected. indeed, the atg5/atg12-atg16 complex is
necessary for the formation of the second conjugate [32].
moreover, overexpression of atg10 facilitates the matura-
tion of map-lc3, overexpression of atg3 facilitates the
conjugation of atg12 to atg5, and excess amount of the
atg12-atg5 conjugate inhibits the map-lc3 maturation
[33].
in yeast, another complex is involved in autophagosome
formation, which requires the autophagic proteins atg9 and
atg2. atg9, the only transmembrane autophagic protein so

fig. 2 conjugation systems involved in autophagy. the first
conjugation system mediates the formation of the conjugate atg12/
atg5. atg12 is activated by the e1-like enzyme atg7, and then atg12
is transferred to the e2-like enzyme atg10. finally, atg12 is
covalently linked to a specific lysine of atg5. then, the conjugate
atg12/atg5 interacts non-covalently with atg16 (atg16l in mam-
mals) to trigger homo-oligomerization leading to a macromolecular
complex necessary for
the formation of autophagosomes. this
structure is associated with the outer side of the autophagosomes in
formation and dissociates from the membranes before the autophago-
some completion. the second conjugation system results in the
the atg8/pe (phosphatidyl–ethanolamin) conjugate.
formation of
atg8 (lc3 in mammals) is first proteolysed by atg4, activated by
the e1-like enzyme atg7, and then transferred to the e2-like enzyme
atg3. finally, atg8 is covalently linked to pe. this conjugate is
present in both sides of the autophagosomes and seems fundamental
for its completion. the two conjugation systems are connected: the
atg5/atg12-atg16 complex is necessary for the formation of the
second conjugate. over-expression of atg10 facilitates the maturation
of map-lc3, over-expression of atg3 facilitates the conjugation of
atg12 to atg5, and excess amount of the atg12-atg5 conjugate
inhibits the map-lc3 maturation
far identified, is necessary for the formation of the pas but
is absent in the mature autophagosomes [34]. matg9, the
human ortholog of the yeast atg9 has been shown to traffic
between the golgi and endosomes, suggesting an involve-
ment of the golgi complex in the autophagic pathway [35].
targeting to and fusion with lysosomes
progression of the autophagic process [37, 38]. fusion is
driven by assembly of pairs of membrane proteins called
snares on each fusion partner [39]. using bafilomycin a1,
an inhibitor of vacuolar h+ atpase (v-atpase), it has been
shown that acidification of the lumenal space of autophago-
somes or lysosomes by v-atpase is an important step for the
fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes [40].
after completion, autophagosomes can fuse in yeast with the
vacuole, or in mammals with the lysosomes to form
autolysosomes, using the same molecular fusion machinery.
before fusing with lysosomes, autophagosomes can also fuse
with endosomes to form amphisomes, making a direct
connection between the endo-lysosomal and autophagic
pathways [36]. membrane fusion can be delineated into
different steps:
the
membrane bilayers. tethering and docking events are
facilitated by multi-protein complexes, and the specificity
of the events is provided by gtpases from the rab family. in
particular,
the final
maturation of late autophagic vacuoles and thus for the
the gtpase rab7 is required for
tethering, docking and fusion of
breakdown
after the fusion step with lysosomes,
the cytoplasmic
material sequestered in autophagosomes is released in the
lysosomal lumen and subsequently consumed by hydro-
lases. this event requires the acidic ph of the lysosome to
efficiently break the inner membrane of the autolysosome.
in yeast, the involvement of the lipase atg15, which is
delivered to the vacuole through the multivesicular bodies,
is required for vesicle breakdown [41]. after degradation of
the sequestered material,
the constituents are recycled
through lysosomal transporters toward the cytosol. recently,
the yeast protein atg22 has been shown to mediate the
j mol med (2007) 85:811–823
815
efflux of leucine and other amino acids resulting from
autophagic degradation [42].
signalling pathways involved in the regulation
of autophagy
is a key regulator
the mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase target of
rapamycin (mtor)
that controls
autophagy triggering and is often called “the gate keeper
of the autophagic pathway” [43, 44]. this kinase senses
environmental changes to modulate autophagy. several
proteins act positively or negatively on mtor and, by this
way, influence the autophagic process. the cascade up-
stream mtor includes class i pi3k and akt, whereas the
phosphatase and tension homolog (pten) acts antagonisti-
cally to the class i pi3k to induce autophagy. rapamycin, a
specific inhibitor of mtor, activates autophagy whereas
amino acids are inhibitors of this process. however, the
precise mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of
autophagy by amino acids remain an open question.
induction of autophagy by nutrient starvation is better
characterised in yeast than in mammals. indeed, it has been
shown that under nutrient-rich conditions, the autophagic
protein atg13 is highly phosphorylated in response to the
tor kinase activation. this phosphorylation status pro-
vides a lower affinity of atg13 for the autophagic serine/
threonine protein kinase atg1, repressing autophagy. in
contrast, under nutrient-deficient conditions, or following
treatment with the tor inhibitor rapamycin, atg13 is
rapidly and partially dephosphorylated, resulting in an
interaction of high affinity with atg1. in these conditions,
the autophagic activity is increased [45]. a putative
ortholog of
the yeast atg1, called ulk1, has been
identified in mammals. this protein seems to be involved
in the localization of the matg9 [46]. it is worth noting that
atg13 is not conserved in mammals.
finally, other signalling pathways independent of mtor
have been involved in the regulation of autophagy [47, 48].
other regulators of the autophagic pathway are the
eif2α kinases. they belong to an evolutionarily conserved
serine/threonine kinase family that regulates stress-induced
translational arrest. it has been demonstrated that the yeast
eif2α kinase gcn2 and the eif2α-regulated transcription-
al transactivator gcn4 are essential for starvation-induced
autophagy [49]. it is worth noting that gcn2 is conserved
in mammals, suggesting that this protein may have a similar
role in higher eukaryotes. recently, endoplasmic reticulum
stress induced by poly-glutamine 72 repeat (polyq72) has
been shown to induce autophagy after activation of the
eif2α kinase pkr-endoplasmic reticulum-related kinase
(perk) activation [50]. in contrast, another study has
reported that the autophagic process triggered in response
to endoplasmic reticulum stress is perk-independent [51].
the mammalian interferon (ifn)-inducible eif2α kinase
pkr (protein kinase rna-activated) plays also an impor-
tant role in triggering autophagy [49]. as pkr is a protein
essential in cellular response to viral infections, this point
will be discussed in more details afterwards [52].
dual role of autophagy in cell survival and cell death
autophagy is a cellular mechanism essential for homeosta-
sis. it has been extensively studied for its ability to maintain
cells alive in response to starvation. this theory has been
confirmed since then by studies demonstrating increased
cell death in cells or organisms lacking gene products
essential for autophagy [53]. a good example to illustrate
this aspect is the demonstration of the role of autophagy
during the early neonatal starvation period. indeed, at birth,
the placental nutrient supply is interrupted, and neonates
face starvation until the first feeding by milk. it has been
shown that autophagy is up-regulated in various tissues
during this period, and those mice incompetent
for
autophagy (atg5 knock-out mice) die within 1 day after
birth [54]. in addition, autophagy has been shown to play a
critical
role in maintaining cellular bioenergetics and
survival during growth factor deprivation in cells incompe-
tent for apoptosis [55]. furthermore, it has been shown that
inhibition of autophagy triggers apoptotic cell death under
conditions of nutrient depletion [56].
despite its role in cell survival, an extensive body of
literature highlights the fact
that autophagy can also be
considered as a cell death pathway (type ii programmed cell
death, pcd). autophagic cell death can be distinguished from
apoptosis (type i pcd) by morphological criteria, i.e. the
presence of autophagosomes in dying cells. cell death with
autophagic features can occur in cells lacking critical apoptosis
executioners, indicating that autophagy can compensate for
defect apoptosis [57]. autophagic cell death has also been
described after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs [58].
however, cell death, characterised by hallmarks of both type i
pcd and type ii pcd, is frequently observed; thus, making a
clear-cut difference between them is difficult [59–62].
the autophagic protein beclin 1, which has first been
identified as a bcl-2 interacting protein, has haplo-insuffi-
cient tumour suppressor functions. its gene mapped to a
tumour susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q21 that is
monoallelically deleted in 40 to 75% of cases of sporadic
breast, ovarian and prostate cancers [63]. it has been
recently shown that bcl-2 negatively regulates beclin 1-
dependent autophagy and beclin 1-dependent autophagic
cell death, connecting the two types of pcd [24]. a new
link between these death processes has been described by
crighton et al. [64], as a p53 target gene encoding a
lysosomal protein, called dram (damage-regulated
autophagy modulator), is also an inducer of autophagy.
816

as autophagy appears essential in the cell fate between
life and death, it is not surprising that it has been implicated
in numerous pathologies,
including neurodegenerative
diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. this dual role has
been very well described in several reviews [44, 65–67].
extended to uninfected adjacent tissues where autophagy
protects cells from death. in this case, autophagy would
play a pro-survival role by blocking pathogen spread and
bystander cell death [76]. at present, no other studies
connecting plant viruses and autophagy have been done.
autophagy and viral infections
both bacteria and viruses can be targeted to autophagic
degradation [67, 68]. the best-characterised examples for
autophagy of pathogens, also termed xenophagy, are
engulfment of mycobacterium tuberculosis in phagosomes
[69],
in
autophagosomes [70] and immune escape by shigella
[71]. moreover, it has been shown recently that staphylo-
coccus aureus can use autophagy for its replication before
inducing an autophagic host cell death [72].
trapping of cytosolic group a streptococci
in this review, we focus on the role of autophagy in the
replication of different viruses.
autophagy is now recognised as a mechanism of
immunity against microbes that invade eukaryotic cells.
on one hand, evidences indicate that autophagy is involved
in the delivery of cytosolic antigens to the mhc class ii
pathway. indeed, antigens are processed before binding to
mhc class ii molecules within endosomal and lysosomal
compartments of antigen-presenting cells for subsequent
presentation to t cells [73]. autophagy is also involved to
digest endogenously synthesised viral proteins, allowing
their processing for mhc ii presentation and thus connect-
ing autophagy with adaptive immunity [14]. on the other
hand, the autophagic process allows the sequestration of
pathogens inside the autophagosomes,
leading to their
destruction by lysosomes.
beside its important role in the immune response against
pathogens, very well described by schmid et al. in [15],
autophagy plays also a direct role in the life cycle of
viruses.
autophagy and viral infection in plants
in plants, the hypersensitive response (hr) is a complex, early
defence response that causes necrosis and cell death at the
infection site to restrict the growth of a pathogen. the hr is
also thought to deprive the pathogens of a supply of food and
thus to confine them to the initial infection site [74]. in
addition, the hr could regulate the defence responses of the
plant in both local and distant tissues [75].
it has been suggested that autophagy acts as an antiviral
mechanism since beclin 1- or atg7-silenced plants present
an accumulation of
tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) at
infection sites. interestingly, induction of autophagy is not
only restricted to the tmv infection sites but
is also
autophagy and viral infections in mammals
autophagy has been first proposed as a protective mech-
anism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens in
autolysosomes. its antiviral role is strengthened by the fact
that ifn signalling pathways are involved in autophagy
induction. indeed, ifns are a family of multifunctional
secreted cytokines that have been characterised by their
ability to interfere with virus infection and replication [77].
however, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert
ifn-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit
[16].
table 1 summarised the different data available about the
infections in
connections between autophagy and viral
mammals and higher plants.
herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1)
herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1) belongs to the herpes
virus family. it is a double-stranded dna virus that resides
in a latent state in sensory neurons. during an attack, the
virus grows down the nerves and out
into the skin or
mucous membranes where it multiplies, causing the clinical
lesions [78].
it is well characterised that the hsv-1 neurovirulence
icp34.5 protein (infected cell protein 34.5) plays a crucial
role in viral infection by inducing the dephosphorylation of
the translation initiation factor eif-2α, and thus negating
the pkr antiviral activity [79, 80]. in accordance with the
role of the pkr-eif-2α pathway in the positive regulation
of autophagy, wild type hsv-1-infected cells do not present
any autophagosomes. however, hsv-1 mutants that do not
express icp34.5 are able to trigger autophagy in infected
cells,
the same
mutant viruses that
infect cells in which pkr is not
expressed exhibit a normal viral replication, demonstrating
that icp34.5 is able to block autophagy by inhibiting the
pkr antiviral activity in infected cells [81]. these results
demonstrate that hsv-1 has evolved strategies to counter-
act cellular antiviral functions [82].

invades the nervous system, and the onset of paralysis can
occur in a matter of hours. rhinoviruses are the most
common viral infective agents in humans, and a causative
agent of the common cold.
in poliovirus-infected cells, it has been observed, early
after infection, an accumulation of membranous structures
in the cytoplasm [83]. these structures are composed of
double-membranes and contain markers of
the entire
secretory pathway, including the rough endoplasmic retic-
ulum, the golgi apparatus and lysosomes. this suggests
that
these double-membrane structures originate from a
process analogous to the formation of autophagic vacuoles
[84]. more recently, map-lc3 and lamp-1 have been
found localised in poliovirus- and rhinovirus-induced
vesicles in infected cells. more precisely, the co-expression
of two poliovirus-encoded proteins called 2bc and 3a
triggers map-lc3 and lamp1 co-localization. moreover,
inhibition of the autophagic process using sirna directed
against the autophagic proteins lc3 and atg12 decreases
both intracellular and extracellular virus yield. the authors
suggested that poliovirus and rhinovirus infection induce
the formation of autophagosome-like structures to serve as
membrane scaffolds for rna replication and to inhibit their
maturation into degradative organelles [85]. because of the
presence of both lc3 and the poliovirus capsid protein vp1
in extracellular structures adjacent
to poliovirus-infected
cells, jackson et al. speculate that viral particles may be
released by a non-lytic pathway using autophagosome-like
vesicles. it has also been suggested that autophagosomes,
which can become single-membraned upon maturation,
provide a mechanism for the non-lytic release of cytoplas-
mic viruses and possibly other cytoplasmic material [86].
very recently,
the arf family of small gtpases, which
controls secretory trafficking, has been shown to associate
with the newly formed membrane structures used for viral
rna replication after poliovirus infection [87].

the human immunodeficiency virus type i (hiv-1) is a
member of the retrovirus family. hiv-1 infection usually
leads to progressive decline in functionality and number of
cd4 t lymphocytes, resulting in aids development [88].
as early as 1991, apoptosis has been proposed as a possible
818
j mol med (2007) 85:811–823
mechanism responsible for cd4 t cell depletion in patients
infected with hiv-1, and an extensive body of literature
since then has supported this hypothesis [89]. in hiv-1-
infected patients, both infected and uninfected cells
undergo accelerated apoptosis,
in vitro and in vivo.
however, hiv-1-induced apoptosis in bystander uninfected
immune cells is likely the major event
leading to the
depletion of cd4 t lymphocytes since the degree of cell
loss largely exceeds the number of infected cells. further-
more, the vast majority of t cells undergoing apoptosis in
peripheral blood and lymph nodes of hiv patients are
uninfected [90]. hiv-1 infection is mediated by the binding
of envelope glycoproteins (env) to the receptor cd4 and a
co-receptor, mainly ccr5 or cxcr4. notably, binding of
env, expressed on hiv-1-infected cells, to cxcr4, triggers
apoptosis of uninfected cd4 t cells. very recently, we have
demonstrated that,
independently of hiv-1 replication,
env-transfected or hiv-1-infected cells that express env
at the cell surface induce autophagy and accumulation of
beclin 1 in uninfected cd4 t lymphocytes, process
dependent on the presence of cxcr4. moreover, autophagy
is a prerequisite to env-induced apoptosis in uninfected
bystander t cells, and cd4 t cells still undergo an env-
mediated cell death with autophagic features when apoptosis
is inhibited [62, 91]. to the best of our knowledge, these
findings represent the first example of autophagy triggered
through binding of viral envelope proteins on target cells,
without viral replication, and leading to apoptosis. at
present, we do not know the significance of env-induced
beclin 1 accumulation in cd4 t cell death and if autophagy
has a role in hiv-1-replication, and these points are
currently under investigation in the laboratory.
it has been shown that hiv-1 uses cytoplasmic late
endosomal structures, identified as mvbs, for its budding
step, suggesting that hiv-1 may use components of the
autophagic machinery for its replication cycle [92]. in
contrast, a recent study suggests that the initiating site for
constitutive hiv-1 assembly and release is not the endo-
somal structure but
the plasma membrane [93]. thus,
observation of hiv-1 particles in mvbs may be considered
as a cellular defence mechanism that restricts the hiv-1
replication cycle by degrading assembled virions.
sindbis virus
the sindbis virus, which provokes encephalitis, belongs to
the togavirus family. its genome is a linear, single-stranded
rna. sindbis-infected apoptotic cell death is closely linked
to viral replication. indeed, the antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein
protects neurons from virus-induced cell death and
decreases viral replication in the central nervous system
[94]. to explore the role of bcl-2 in this context, a yeast
two-hybrid screen has been performed and has permitted to
identify the autophagic protein beclin 1 as a bcl-2
interacting protein in infected cells. the brains of mice
infected with a recombinant virus that expresses beclin 1
show fewer sindbis virus rna-positive cells,
fewer
apoptotic cells, and lower viral titers than the brains of
mice infected with recombinant viruses that express a
beclin 1 protein deleted in its bcl-2 interacting domain, or
beclin 1 containing a premature stop codon. these results
provide evidence of an antiviral activity of the autophagic
protein beclin 1 [95]. however, no further studies have
been done on the role of the entire autophagic process in
the reduction in sindbis virus infection.
the human b19 parvovirus
b19 belongs to the parvovirus family whose genome is a
single-stranded dna. it infects erythroid cells and causes
several diseases including aplastic crisis in patients with
haemolytic anemia, erythema infectiosum and hydrops
fetalis [96]. b19 infection induces cell cycle arrest at g1
and g2/m phases and apoptosis mediated by a viral non-
structural protein called ns1 [97]. recently, it has been
shown that autophagy is induced in human parvovirus b19-
infected cells arrested in g2 phase, before they are
competent for viral replication,
leading to infected-cell
survival. these results suggest that autophagy may benefit
b19 in allowing viral multiplication before cell collapse
[98].
coronavirus
coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense rna viruses
that replicate entirely in the cytoplasm of cells. they are the
cause of many domesticated animal diseases and are
responsible for up to 30% of human colds. a new human
coronavirus has recently been identified as the causative
agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).
murine hepatitis virus (mhv), which belongs to the
coronavirus family,
is frequently used to study the
formation and function of the viral replication complexes.
these complexes present a punctate perinuclear localisation
and their number and size increase over the course of
infection. moreover, mhv rna replication occurs on
cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles whose membranes
are issued from the rough endoplasmic reticulum [99]. the
co-localization of late endosomal proteins and lc3 with
viral rna-replication proteins on these membranes argues
for their derivation from the autophagic pathway [99].
importantly,
the formation of autophagosome-like struc-
tures seems beneficial for mhv viral production. indeed,
the yield of extracellular virus is diminished 1,000-fold in
clonal isolates of atg5−/− mouse embryonic stem cells. in
addition, expression of ectopic atg5 in these cells restores
j mol med (2007) 85:811–823
819
the wild-type yield [99]. these results demonstrate that
atg5, which is crucial for the autophagic pathway,
is
required for the production of infectious mhv virions. in
consequences, the autophagic pathway may be required for
the formation of double-membrane-bound mhv replication
complexes and, by this way, may significantly enhance the
efficiency of replication. however, the exact role of atg5 in
this process is not fully determined. it would be interesting
to know if atg5 benefits to mhv only by inducing the
formation of autophagic membranes or if it has a more
specific function in the viral replication cycle.
in sars-infected cells, the early formation and accu-
mulation of
typical double-membrane vesicles, which
probably carry the viral replication, have been observed
by electron microscopy. opposite to what was described for
mhv, morphological and labelling studies argued against
the previously proposed involvement of the autophagic
pathway as the source for
the vesicles, and instead
suggested the endoplasmic reticulum to be the most likely
donor of the membranes that carry the sars replication
complex [100].
rotavirus
rotavirus belongs to the reovirus family whose genome is a
dsrna. infection with this virus is the first cause of
infantile gastroenteritis. rotavirus nonstructural protein 4
(nsp4) has functions in viral morphogenesis and patho-
genesis. a recent report shows that inhibition of nsp4
expression by small interfering rnas leads to alteration of
the production and distribution of other viral proteins and
mrna synthesis, suggesting that nsp4 also affects virus
replication.
in rotavirus-infected cells, it has been shown that nsp4
co-localises with lc3 in structures associated with the sites
of nascent viral rna replication. this report suggests that
autophagy may be involved in rotavirus replication [101].
however,
the precise role of this process in rotavirus
infection needs further investigations.
bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv)
bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) belongs to the
flavivirus family whose genome is a ssrna. the genomic
rna contains one long open reading frame that
is
translated into a polyprotein. this polyprotein is processed
by cellular and virus-encoded proteases. bvdv-infection
represents an economically important cause of disease of
farm animals. the mucosal desease (md) is the most severe
clinical condition resulting from infection by bvdv. both a
cytopathogenic virus (cp-bvdv) and a non-cytopathogenic
virus (noncp-bvdv) are required for induction of md.
infection with noncp-bvdv occurs intra-utero,
leading
to a specific immunotolerance. the disease is induced
by super-infection with a cp-bvdv or by generation of
a cp-mutant of the persisting noncp-virus. in most cases,
rna recombination is responsible for the switch from a
noncp- to a cp-virus.
several
types of cellular insertions, which code for
ubiquitin, different ubiquitin-like proteins, a protein of
unknown function or a part of lc3, have been found.
naturally occurring noncp-viruses express the fusion
protein ns2-3, but further processing gives rise to both
proteins ns2 and ns3, only present in cp-bvdv. interest-
ingly,
it has been shown that lc3 inserted in the
polyprotein of a naturally occurring mutant bvdv served
as a proteolytic processing signal by a cellular protease
related to atg4, allowing the expression of the viral ns3
protein. these data provide evidence of
the use of
autophagy proteins for the expression of viral proteins,
linked to the pathology [102].
interferon system and autophagy
ifns are a family of multifunctional secreted cytokines that
have been characterised by their ability to inhibit virus
infection and replication [77]. they can be divided in two
sub-groups: ifn type i (α,β) and ifn type ii (γ). after
their secretion, ifns bind to specific cell surface receptors
and act
in paracrine and autocrine ways to induce
expression of more than 200 genes called ifn-stimulated
genes (isgs). the large majority of them are still not
characterised and their involvement in the ifn system is
very fragmentary.
the ifn
functions, namely antiviral, antiproliferative, immunomod-
ulatory and apoptotic functions [77]. all these effects of
ifns seem to converge towards the most known ifn
activity that is an antiviral function. in consequence, it is
not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to
circumvent the ifn antiviral response and even use ifn-
induced processes to replicate more efficiently [103].
isgs are the effectors of
interestingly, beside the fact
that ifnγ can induce
autophagic vacuole formation, several proteins known to
be involved in triggering autophagy are involved in the ifn
response [104]. among them, we can mention the double-
stranded rna-dependent pkr, the death-associated protein
kinase and dapk-related protein-1 (dapk and drp-1),
the tnf-related apoptosis inducing ligand (trail) and the
fas-associated death domain (fadd).
dsrna-dependent protein kinase (pkr)
pkr is a serine–threonine protein kinase inactive at a basal
level and whose activity can be stimulated by different
inducers. it has been first associated with the antiviral
action of ifns [105]. it can be activated by dsrna, a
820
j mol med (2007) 85:811–823
common intermediate in the replication of many viruses
[106]. after
interaction with dsrna, pkr undergoes
conformational changes that trigger its autophosphorylation
and thus its activation. the major substrate of pkr is the
α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif2α,
resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis [107]. however,
pkr can be activated without viral dsrna or viral
infection by different stresses or through protein-protein
interactions. for
instance, pkr can be activated by
interacting with the protein pkr activating protein (pact),
leading to apoptosis [108].
the role of pkr in autophagy triggering is mediated by
its capacity to inhibit protein translation through eif-2α
phosphorylation. at present, hsv-1 is the only virus
known to inhibit induction of pkr-dependent autophagy,
through action of the viral protein icp34.5 [82]. as a large
number of viruses are able to inhibit dsrna-mediated pkr
activation and eif2α phosphorylation, it would be interest-
ing to analyse their role in autophagy regulation [68].
death-associated protein kinase: dapk and drp-1
dapk is a calcium–calmodulin (cam)-regulated serine/
threonine kinase involved in ifnγ-mediated cell death
[109]. four additional kinases of the family have been
identified according to homologies with dapk in the
catalytic domain [110]. drp-1 is one of the closest family
members, as its catalytic domains share approximately 80%
identity to those of dapk.
it has been shown that
expression of dapk or drp-1 in cells induces morpholog-
ical changes associated with membrane blebbing and
mediates a caspase-independent cell death pathway with
formation of autophagic vesicles that are characteristic of
type ii programmed cell death [111].
tnf-receptor apoptosis induced ligand (trail)
trail, also called apo2l, initiates apoptosis of tumour
cells by binding to either of its receptors, dr4 or dr5.
using an in vitro morphogenesis model, in which mcf-
10a human mammary epithelial cells form hollow acini-
like structures, it has been demonstrated that trail is
required for
the induction of autophagy. the authors
demonstrated that both apoptotic cell death and autophagic
cell death are required to eliminate the cells during the
lumen formation [112].
fas-associated death domain (fadd)
in this study, pyo and collaborators have demonstrated that
atg5 mediates ifnγ-induced vacuole formation and sub-
sequent cell death through interaction with fadd [104].
moreover, recent data has identified a novel cell death
pathway activated by fadd that combines apoptosis and
autophagy and that is selectively inactivated at the earliest
stages of epithelial cancer development [114].
conclusion
considering these data, it becomes clear that autophagy is a
fundamental and general process playing a role in viral
infections. indeed, this process is involved in both adaptive
and innate immunity, contributing to clearance of intracel-
lular pathogens, and in cell survival or cell death.
moreover, viruses are able to evolve strategies to counteract
or to exploit autophagy to their own profit. indeed, several
viruses can block autophagy triggering to avoid their
destruction in autolysosomes. in contrast, other viruses
use autophagosomes to their own replication. unravelling
the specific role of autophagy in different viral infections
would be a crucial step in the understanding of
the
pathogenesis.
finally, knowledge of the relationships between autophagy
and the antiviral ifns open new routes of investigation. as a
large number of ifn-inducible proteins have still no known
biological function, it would be very interesting to determine
their role in autophagy triggering.
the interplay between the autophagic pathway and the
life cycle is thus complex and needs a better
viral
comprehension to provide new antiviral therapeutics.
