abstract
macroautophagy, a lysosomal pathway responsible for the turnover of organelles and long-
lived proteins, has been regarded mainly as an inducible process in neurons, which is mobilized
in states of stress and injury. new studies show, however, that macroautophagy is also consti-
tutively active in healthy neurons and is vital to cell survival. neurons in the brain, unlike cells
in the periphery, are protected from large-scale autophagy induction because they can use sev-
eral diﬀerent energy sources optimally, receive additional nutrients and neurotrophin support
from glial cells, and beneﬁt from hypothalamic regulation of peripheral nutrient supplies. due
to its exceptional eﬃciency, constitutive autophagy in healthy neurons proceeds in the absence
of easily detectable autophagic vacuole intermediates. these intermediates can accumulate
rapidly, however, when late steps in the autophagic process are blocked. autophagic vacuoles
also accumulate abnormally in aﬀected neurons of several major neurodegenerative diseases,
including alzheimer’s disease and parkinson’s disease, where they have been linked to various
aspects of disease pathogenesis including neuronal cell death. the build-up of autophagic vac-
uoles in these neurological disorders and others may reﬂect either heightened autophagy
induction, impairment in later digestive steps in the autophagy pathway, or both. determining
the basis for av accumulation is critical for understanding the pathogenic signiﬁcance of
autophagy in a given pathologic state and for designing possible therapies based on modulat-
ing autophagy. in this review, we discuss the special features of autophagy regulation in the

1. introduction
cell survival depends on the capacity to change metabolic states in response to
external stimuli that vary from early development to senescence. depending on
the availability of nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) or trophic stimuli
(growth factors and hormones), cells can switch metabolically from an anabolic state
to one of catabolism. the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents for energy is regu-
lated by the endosomal/autophagic/lysosomal (eal) system, complementing the
degradation of most short-lived proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
autophagy is the general term used to describe the ‘‘self-eating’’ or catabolism of
cytoplasm, including organelles, which may occur by at least three distinct routes:
chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma); microautophagy; and macroautophagy.
while all three forms of autophagy ultimately end with the degradation of substrates
within lysosomes, each process has unique features. chaperone-mediated autophagy
involves the selective targeting of proteins containing a kferq-like peptide motif
to lysosomes for degradation (majeski and dice, 2004), while microautophagy
involves the pinocytosis of small quantities of cytosol directly by lysosomes (muller
et al., 2000). the third form of autophagy, known as macroautophagy, involves the
sequestration of cytosolic regions containing proteins, sugars, lipids, rna, and
organelles, such as mitochondria, and perixosomes into double-membraned vacuoles
that deliver their contents to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments for deg-
radation (shintani and klionsky, 2004). while basal levels of autophagy ensure that
intracellular protein aggregates and expired mitochondria are removed (brunk and
terman, 2002; komatsu et al., 2005), autophagy has been largely recognized as an
inducible process due to its markedly heightened activity by nutrient or growth fac-
tor-deprivation, stress or pathogenic invasion (levine, 2005; kiﬃn et al., 2006).

when macroautophagy is induced, the sequestration of large regions of cytosol into
autophagic vacuoles (avs), often with a diameter of 0.5 lm or larger, makes it the
largest contributor to autophagic proteolysis, compared to cma and microauto-
phagy (massey et al., 2006).
although macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) and protein syn-
thesis are at opposite ends of the metabolic spectrum, both mechanisms are sensitive
to intracellular amino acid levels and share a common signaling pathway, which is
regulated by the growth regulating kinase, mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin)
(beugnet et al., 2003). phosphorylation of mtor via the pi3 kinase/akt-signaling
pathway induces protein synthesis, while mtor dephosphorylation inhibits protein
synthesis and is linked with autophagy activation (somwar et al., 1998). mtor-
mediated autophagy is particularly sensitive to the availability of speciﬁc amino
acids (e.g. leucine and histidine), insulin, growth factors, and atp, and if the levels
of any of these regulators decrease autophagy is activated (proud et al., 2001; lum
et al., 2005).
to date, seven autophagy-related ‘‘atg’’ proteins are known to directly regulate
the formation of avs (for a detailed review see (ohsumi, 2001; levine and klionsky,
2004). firstly, the atg12 ubiquitin-like conjugation system, comprised of atg 5, 7,
10, and 12, regulates the elongation of the av isolation membrane, known as a
phagophore (mizushima et al., 1998, 2001). secondly, the atg8 conjugation system
(atg 3, 4, 7 and 8) regulates the attachment of the phospholipid, phosphatidyleth-
anolamine (pe) to atg8 (ichimura et al., 2000). a mammalian homolog of atg8,
which was ﬁrst characterized in yeast cells, is known as microtubule-associated pro-
tein light chain 3 (map-lc3) (lang et al., 1998; ohsumi, 2001). map-lc3 is nor-
mally cleaved from microtubule-associated proteins 1a and b by a cysteine protease,
producing the cytosolic lc3-i isoform (kabeya et al., 2000). the neuronal cyto-
plasm is densely packed with microtubules, and as a result, lc3-i is found abun-
dantly throughout the neuronal cytoskeleton (mizushima, 2004; boland et al,
unpublished observations, 2006).
metabolic regulation of autophagic proteolysis was ﬁrst proposed by de duve and
colleagues in the 1960s using cell fractionation and electron microscopy analyses of
rat liver cells. in the 1980s, autophagy-signaling pathways were mainly characterized
in yeast cells; however, the liver continues to be the most extensively used organ/cell
type for research on mammalian autophagy. the ﬂuctuating presence of autophagy
modulators, such as free amino acids, insulin, and adrenaline, and activators, such
as glucagon, in the liver’s blood supply makes hepatocytes an ideal cell type to study
autophagy repression and activation (seglen et al., 1991). nutrient supply to the
brain, by contrast, is tightly regulated and autophagy induction is not apparent in
cortical regions of the mouse brain, even after 48 h of food deprivation (mizushima,
2004). to understand the brain’s resistance to starvation-induced autophagy, it is
important to consider the unique adaptive mechanisms that protect neurons from
nutritional deprivation and the unwanted repercussions of large-scale autophagy acti-
vation. in this review, we will discuss why ongoing autophagy is less apparent in the
healthy brain than in other tissues. we will also consider recent studies that suggest
neuronal autophagy fulﬁlls important survival functions in neurodevelopment and

in mature neurons. finally, we will discuss the implications of autophagy dysfunction
in neurodegenerative disease and the importance of distinguishing among varying
possible molecular bases for autophagy-related pathology to deﬁne new therapeutic
interventions in these disorders.
1.1. resistance of brain to autophagy induction by peripheral nutrient ﬂuctuation
despite using the greatest percentage of total body energy, the brain contains
minimal energy reserves and is highly dependent on an external supply of nutrients.
the selective uptake of substrates, such as glucose and amino acids (vannucci et al.,
1997; hawkins et al., 2006), and peptide hormones, such as insulin and leptin
(banks, 2004; zhang et al., 2005), across the blood-brain-barrier ensures optimal
nutrient entry into the brain. when nutrient availability is low, the brain maintains
a suﬃcient nutrient supply by increasing the catabolism of glycogen, adipose fat, and
muscle from peripheral sources. glucose-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus
adjust peripheral glucose levels by autonomic stimulation of the pancreas to release
glucagon and insulin, the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline and noradrenaline,
and the pituitary gland to release hormones that regulate glucocorticoid and thyroid
hormone levels (uyama et al., 2004). in addition to raising peripheral glucose levels,
the autophagy-stimulating peptide, glucagon, increases free amino acid levels by
fig. 1. the brain regulates peripheral glucose levels and autophagy through shared pathways. the brains
ability to prioritize nutrient supply to itself at the expense of peripheral stores, prevents neurons
undergoing starvation-induced autophagy in vivo. acutely sensitive hypothalamic neurons initiate the
release of autophagic regulators, insulin and glucagon, in response to high or low nutrient availability. in
addition, the blood brain barrier restricts insulin and glucagon access into the brain, prioritizing their
eﬀects on peripheral tissues such as the liver, muscle and adipose fat. while the hypothalamus is most
widely recognized as a brain region responsible for the regulation of glucose levels, it may also be
considered the hierarchical regulator of autophagy in vivo.

inducing both glycogen breakdown and autophagy in the liver (deter and de duve,
1967). insulin also assumes the dual function of increasing glucose uptake into cells
while inhibiting autophagy (pfeifer, 1977). the hypothalamus, therefore, may be
considered the hierarchical regulator of autophagy in vivo, in addition to its role
as a regulator of blood glucose levels (fig. 1). phospho-mtor is particularly abun-
dant in the paraventricular and arcuate neurons of the hypothalamus and is respon-
sive to peripheral nutrient ﬂuctuation (cota et al., 2006). although mtor activity is
minimally aﬀected in cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain by prolonged
starvation for up to 48 h, mtor activity declines after 24 h of starvation in hypotha-
lamic arcuate neurons and inﬂuences food intake in mice (cota et al., 2006).
while large-scale autophagy in neurons is undesirable, constitutive autophagy is
now recognized as a vital housekeeping function (komatsu et al., 2005). although
autophagy helps to maintain energy stores, it also requires atp, the availability
of which inﬂuences activity (sakai and ogawa, 1982). therefore, in addition to reg-
ulating peripheral nutrient supply, the brain has evolved mechanisms that ensure
optimal availability and utilization of energy substrates at a local level. neurons
ensure maximum glucose utilization by having superior glucose uptake and higher
expression of the glucose-degrading enzyme, hexokinase, compared to glial cells (van-
nucci et al., 1997; cimino et al., 1998). neurons are also able to self-regulate synaptic
activity depending on atp availability, which is mediated by atp-sensitive potas-
sium channels ðkþ
atpþ (peters et al., 2004). if atp levels progressively decline during
profound hypoglycemia, reduced atp inhibition of kþ
atp channels allows k+ ion
inﬂux to hyperpolarize neurons, which decreases neurotransmission (levin et al.,
2001). the ‘‘global silencing’’ of the brain that occurs during extreme starvation, dia-
betes, and stroke, is believed to protect neurons from degenerating (mobbs et al.,
2001) and may have interesting implications for neuronal autophagy regulation.
neurons are also protected from nutrient deprivation at a local level by glial cells,
which provide more than just scaﬀold-based support for neurons. glial cells release
growth factors, cytokines, and other substrates that are essential for neuron survival.
in the absence of vital growth factors such as ngf and/or gdnf, sympathetic gan-
glion neurons die with extensive autophagic involvement (yu et al., 2003), highlight-
ing roles of glial-derived growth factors in regulating neuronal autophagy as well as
anabolic signaling. the brain stores minimal amounts of glycogen compared to other
organs, and these stores are almost exclusively found in astrocytes (phelps, 1972).
when blood glucose levels are low, astrocytic glycogen is degraded into lactate,
ketones and glucose, which are released at gap junctions to nearby neurons (guzman
and blazquez, 2001; ghosh et al., 2005). unlike most cells, neurons have evolved the
ability to metabolize either glucose, lactate, or ketones, depending on which source is
available (peters et al., 2004), thus ensuring neuronal energy supply is not compro-
mised in times of low glucose availability.
1.2. neuronal autophagy in physiological states
after the discovery of lysosomes by de duve in the 1960s, neurons became a focus
of early morphological investigations of autophagy (holtzman and novikoﬀ, 1965).
508
b. boland, r.a. nixon / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 503–519
some of the ﬁrst important insights into the dynamic mechanisms of this process,
however, came several decades later by hollenbeck and colleagues, whose studies
characterized autophagosome-related compartments, their retrograde transport,
and progressive maturation and fusion with lysosomes along neuritic processes (hol-
lenbeck, 1993). by reporting on active real-time av formation at distal axonal
regions, hollenbeck provided evidence that constitutive neuronal autophagy may
serve as both a key mechanism for remodeling neurite and growth cone structure
during neurite extension and as a neuroprotective mechanism by removing damaged
proteins and organelles that may otherwise accumulate within axons. recent addi-
tional studies have emphasized the importance of eﬃcient bi-directional vesicular
transport and retrograde signaling for neuronal survival (bannai et al., 2004; reic-
hardt and mobley, 2004).
despite indications of active autophagy in developing cultured neurons, detec-
tion of constitutive autophagy activity in neurons of the adult brain was elusive
until recently. unlike ﬁbroblasts and hepatocytes that contain considerable num-
bers of avs in nutrient-rich conditions, healthy neurons contain few avs (nixon
et al., 2005) and express low levels of autophagosome-bound lc3-ii relative to
lc3-i, which is several orders of magnitude more abundant (mizushima, 2004;
yu et al., 2005). the unchanging levels and distribution of lc3-ii in the cortex
after nutrient deprivation in mice also initially reinforced the idea that autophagy
is minimally active in brain. however, this idea seemed at odds with the fact that
macroautophagy is the only mechanism available to cells for the turnover of organ-
elles: these structures have ﬁnite half-lives and neurons survive many decades.
indeed, constitutive autophagy has recently been shown to be an indispensable
function in neurons based on studies of transgenic mice in which either of two
atg genes required for autophagy function were deleted speciﬁcally from neurons.
mice lacking either atg5 or atg7 exhibit motor and behavioral deﬁcits by p14 as
well as degeneration and loss of purkinje cell neurons in the cerebellum and pyra-
midal neurons in the hippocampus (hara et al., 2006; komatsu et al., 2006). diﬀuse
protein aggregates appear in surviving neurons within these brain regions and oth-
ers, culminating in the formation of toxic inclusion bodies. because neuronal pro-
teasome activity is not reduced in these mouse models, the results imply that
autophagy is normally responsible for clearing aggregated proteins that are not
degraded by the proteasome (rideout et al., 2004). severe neurodegeneration in
mice that are deﬁcient in neuronal autophagy underscores the importance of con-
stitutive autophagy for neuronal survival.
the observation that avs are generally scarce in brain tissue although autophagy
is active in healthy neurons can now also be understood from the kinetics of av for-
mation and degradation. it has been shown that lc3-ii levels and distribution at a
single point in time do not accurately represent levels of autophagic activity: auto-
phagosome markers, such as lc3-ii, rise if autophagy is either induced or is blocked
at a later autophagy step that slows or prevents degradation of the marker (tanida
et al., 2004). this concept, applied to the brain, suggests that a very low frequency of
autophagy intermediates, such as autophagosomes, can reﬂect either a low rate of
autophagy or the eﬃciency of autophagosome turnover (and lc3-ii degradation)

is very high. recent studies of neurons (boland et al., submitted) support this idea.
primary neurons in culture have few avs but transiently accumulate many lc3-ii-
positive autophagosomes after induction with rapamycin or serum withdrawal.
inhibiting cathepsin activity, however, also rapidly and markedly elevates lc3-ii
and increases numbers of autophagosomes without changing the activity of mtor,
an index of autophagy induction. these observations imply that constitutive
autophagy in neurons is quite active but is exceptionally eﬃcient at eliminating auto-
phagosomes and later stage autophagic vacuoles once they are formed. a highly eﬃ-
cient av processing system in cells that are also largely protected from nutritional
ﬂuctuations could partly explain why few avs are normally seen in healthy neurons
of the brain.
these foregoing studies emphasize that ancillary criteria beyond the levels of
autophagosome markers are required to accurately interpret the basis for any
av accumulation within cells. distinguishing among factors that modulate the
rate of av formation and the rate of av degradation (fig. 2) is now critical
for understanding the basis for av accumulation in pathologic states and for
interpreting how dyfunctional autophagy contributes to disease development
(chu, 2006). indices of autophagy signaling and induction based on the activity
of mtor and indices of autophagic protein turnover eﬃciency, such as metabolic
labeling analyses (massey et al., 2006), have become essential to an assessment of
autophagy in pathologic states. although single timepoint measurements of lc3-
ii expression are diﬃcult to interpret, levels measured at multiple timepoints can
be more informative; a tapering over time of an initial rise in lc3-ii, for exam-
ple, is commonly seen with autophagy induction, while a progressive increase in
lc3-ii over time is more consistent with impaired degradation (tanida et al.,
2004). the morphology of diﬀerent populations of avs accumulating in neuro-
pathological states is also informative when characterizing pathologic autophagy
responses. as shown in fig. 3, for example, the avs associated with autophagy
induction in primary cortical neurons are quite distinct from those that accumu-
late when av fusion is impaired by vinblastine-induced disruption of the cyto-
skeleton for short or long periods, or when degradation of autophagic cargoes
is blocked by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes (henell and glaumann, 1984; tanida
et al., 2004) (fig. 3, unpublished observations).

of cathepsins d, b and l by exposure of neurons to the protease inhibitors pepstatin and leupeptin yielded
avs and autolysosomes with morphology distinct from that seen in a–c. the morphologic features of
accumulating avs may be helpful in deﬁning the basis for a given autophagy pathology in disease states.

1.3. autophagy in brain development and plasticity
the involvement of autophagy in cell diﬀerentiation and development has been
mainly studied in yeast, plants, nematodes, and ﬂies (levine and klionsky, 2004),
although early morphologic studies of brain development were the basis for deﬁn-
ing a form of neuronal programmed cell death (pcd) distinct from apoptosis and
necrosis, called autophagic cell death (acd) (cao et al., 2006), which is character-
ized by a marked proliferation of avs and the progressive disappearance of organ-
elles (schweichel and merker, 1973; clarke, 1990). in acd, neurons destined for
elimination internalize cytoplasmic components into autophagic compartments to
eﬀect self-degradation. death occurs by hyperactive autophagy and an important
criterion for preventing or slowing acd is by inhibiting autophagy (nixon and
cataldo, 2006). while this concept has been validated for cells in some developing
tissues (baehrecke, 2005), few examples of acd in brain tissue are well established
by these criteria (nixon and cataldo, 2006). insights into the importance of
autophagy in pcd during brain development, however, will
likely come from
the studies of mice in which either the atg5 or atg7 genes required for autophago-
some formation are deleted speciﬁcally in neurons (hara et al., 2006; komatsu
b. boland, r.a. nixon / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 503–519
511
et al., 2006). these mice survive to an early postnatal age indicating that brain
development is still possible in the absence of atg5 or atg6, even though many pop-
ulations later degenerate. because neural circuitry has not yet been analyzed, how-
ever, the question of whether or not autophagy is essential for development,
connectivity, or pcd of speciﬁc neuronal populations in developing mammalian
brain is yet to be answered fully. it will also be important to establish in these
future studies whether or not developing neurons compensate in some way for
the loss of atg5 or atg7 function by inducing other
lysosomal
degradation.
forms of
the importance of beclin 1 (autophagy gene 6; atg6), a component of a pi3
kinase protein complex essential for autophagy induction and cell growth control
(liang et al., 1999; kihara et al., 2001), has also been investigated by generating mice
lacking this gene. although no report has been published to date on neuronal defects
in these beclin 1 ( / ) mice, their death at approximately 7.5 days in utero indicates
that embryonic development is severely impaired (yue et al., 2003). the basis for a
more profound eﬀect on embryogenesis when beclin 1 is deleted, compared to that
seen in atg5 and atg7 null mice is not clear but might reﬂect more pervasive eﬀects
of beclin 1 on cell function or, possibly, less eﬀective compensatory mechanisms in
neurons for the loss of beclin 1 function.
in the adult brain, long-term synaptic plasticity involves remodeling of nerve ter-
minals not unlike the remodeling that occurs in developing neurons as they extend
processes and form connections. this plasticity, which underlies long-term potenti-
ation (ltp) and depression (ltd) (tang et al., 2002; hou and klann, 2004), is
maintained partly by local protein synthesis at synaptic regions (steward and schu-
man, 2001). the abundance of mtor in hippocampal dendrites has been interpreted
as evidence for pre-synaptic protein synthesis and is supported by additional obser-
vations that several translational proteins that are regulated by mtor, such as 4e-
bp1, 4ebp-2, and eif-4e, are also present in post-synaptic hippocampal dendrites.
notably, mtor activity appears to modulate post-synaptic ltp and ltd as well as
nmda and ampa-mediated protein synthesis in dendrites (gong et al., 2006).
autophagy, however, also regulates gabaa receptor traﬃcking and degradation
via the atg8 homolog, gabarap (gaba receptor associated protein) (leil
et al., 2004; rowland et al., 2006). it is, therefore, interesting to speculate that the
regulation at synapses of both autophagy and protein synthesis by mtor activity
is critical for diﬀerent aspects of synaptic plasticity and that mtor might act as a
critical switch point that suppresses autophagy during synaptic strengthening
(ltp) and induces it during ltd.
1.4. autophagy in neurodegeneration
while the brain is relatively protected from autophagy induction by nutritional
deprivation compared to other tissues, neurons are, nevertheless, responsive to other
stimuli that induce autophagy, particularly in pathologic states. neurotrophin
deprivation, often a factor in neurodegeneration, is a strong stimulus for autophagy
induction (xue et al., 1999). toxic factors, such as abnormal protein aggregation,
512
b. boland, r.a. nixon / molecular aspects of medicine 27 (2006) 503–519
also stimulate autophagy in disease states (fortun et al., 2003; yamamoto et al.,
2006), using in some cases a route that bypasses the nutrient-regulated mtor path-
way (yamamoto et al., 2006). in addition, other pathologic factors impair the exe-
cution of autophagy during its normal housekeeping role or after its induction in
response to stress. as discussed earlier, either induction or impaired autophagy exe-
cution in neurons can promote av accumulations, which are increasingly reported
as pathological ﬁndings in certain neurodegenerative disorders. although av prolif-
eration in degenerating cells has often been interpreted as an indication that autoph-
agy over-activation is mediating neurodegeneration or acd, an alternative view is
emerging that autophagy is induced in most of these disease settings to protect neu-
rons by eliminating abnormal and potentially toxic proteins and organelles that
might trigger injury or apoptosis (levine and yuan, 2005; nixon and cataldo,
2006). degeneration and cell death can subsequently develop when etiologic factors
in the disease directly or indirectly impair the eﬃcacy of autophagy in its neuropro-
tective role. in some cases, progressive damage and destabilization of the membranes
of the accumulating avs and lysosomes can lead to the cytoplasmic release of lyso-
somal hydrolases and cell death (nixon and cataldo, 2006; kroemer and jaattela,
2005).
while the necessary criteria to establish acd have been applied to only a few
neuropathological states so far, overactive autophagy seems to be a key factor medi-
ating the degeneration of purkinje neurons in lurcher mice, which express a mutant
form of the ionotropic glutamate receptor, grid2 (yue et al., 2002). an interaction
between grid2 and beclin1 is the ﬁrst example of a direct link between neurotrans-
mitter receptor function and autophagy regulation (yue et al., 2002). the possible
modulation of autophagy by a grid2-beclin 1 interaction, and the role of gaba-
rap in autophagy regulation and gaba receptor traﬃcking (kabeya et al.,
2000), suggest important relationships between neurotransmission and autophagy
activation in neurons, which might provide insights into the role of autophagy in
excitotoxin-mediated neurodegeneration. autophagy is also activated in neurons
exposed to hypoxic (zhu et al., 2005) or excitotoxic stimuli (borsello et al., 2003);
however, an incisive role of autophagy over-activation in the degenerative process
is not yet established. a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyladenine
(3ma), has also been shown to protect against cell death in certain in vitro settings,
including chloroquine-treated cortical neurons (zaidi et al., 2001), nerve growth fac-
tor (ngf)-deprived sympathetic neurons (xue et al., 1999), and cerebellar granule
cells deprived of serum and k+ (canu et al., 2005). autophagy in these examples
is considered to be either a triggering stimulus or a partner with either apoptotic
or necrotic mechanisms in the cell death process (levine and yuan, 2005).
in other neurodegenerative disease states
in which autophagy has been
implicated, the evidence suggests that neuronal cell death stems from a failure of
autophagy to sustain an adequate level of degradative activity rather than overactive
autophagy. studies of atg5 and atg7 gene deletion underscore the importance of a
constitutive level of autophagosome formation for neuronal survival even in the
absence of any disease factor that could elicit an autophagic response. further sup-
porting the pathogenic signiﬁcance of autophagy failure are observations that

impeding the actions of one or more cathepsins essential for degrading autophago-
some cargoes is associated with progressive neurodegeneration as shown in cathep-
sin d ( / ) mice and cathepsin b and l ( / ) mice (koike et al., 2005). autophagy
dysfunction associated with av accumulation in neurons can also arise from
impaired vesicular transport (stokin et al., 2005), defective fusion of autophago-
somes with lysosomes (ravikumar et al., 2005), or reduced lysosomal activity (bi
et al., 1999). autophagosome–lysosome fusion is slowed in aging cells (terman,
1995) and the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in aging neurons (brunk
and terman, 2002) lends additional support to the idea that age-related impairments
of autophagy are likely to be an important factor in the development of some late-
age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. the appearance of oxidative stress in the
brain in many of these aging-related disorders may involve, in part, the impaired
degradation of mitochondria (‘‘mitophagy’’), a major contributing factor to oxida-
tive stress (lemasters, 2005).
the emerging view that autophagy is initially induced as a neuroprotective
response in stressed or injured neurons but is subsequently overwhelmed or
impaired by disease-related factors could partly account for evidence that autophagy
seems to be both induced and impaired in several major neurodegenerative diseases,
including alzheimer’s disease (ad). impaired autophagic function in ad is evi-
denced by a massive build-up of autophagy intermediates especially within dystro-
phic dendrites of aﬀected neurons, indicating that the usually eﬃcient progression
of autophagosomes to lysosomes is impeded (nixon et al., 2005). autophago-
some–lysosome fusion is already known to be slowed by normal cell aging (marti-
nez-vicente et al., 2005) and additional risk factors for ad, including mutations of
presenilin, impair autophagy (nixon et al., in press; cataldo et al., 2004). autopha-
gic vacuoles are highly enriched in c-secretase and actively generate the toxic amy-
loid-b peptide (ab) during autophagy (yu et al., 2005). although normally most of
the generated ab would be degraded within lysosomes, in ad and transgenic ad
models, the marked buildup of autophagic intermediates within an impaired
autophagy pathway is a signiﬁcant source and intracellular reservoir of ab (yu
et al., 2005). ab within lysosomal compartments can destabilize av membranes
and trigger release of hydrolytic enzymes into the cytoplasm (glabe, 2001). the
e4 variant of the cholesterol carrier apolipoprotein e (apoe), a strong risk factor
for ad, compounds this membrane injury (ji et al., 2002). therefore, in light of evi-
dence that constitutive autophagy is required for neuron survival, a strong link
seems to exist between ad, autophagic failure, neurodegeneration, amyloidogenesis,
and possibly the intracellular accumulation of other disease-related proteins such as
tau.
autophagy failure in the presence of autophagy induction is also evident in other
neurological disorders. juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis caused by mutations
of an endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein encoded by cln3, causes mental
retardation, dementia and extensive neurodegeneration (cao et al., 2006). a genetic
model of the disease, the cln3 ( / ) mouse, exhibits neurodegeneration associated
with accumulations of avs containing incompletely degraded proteins, which is
indicative of impaired autophagic proteolysis. metabolic studies of cln3 ( / )

mice conﬁrm that autophagic protein turnover is slowed in cerebellar cells even
though levels of autophagy induction are higher than normal. further inhibiting
autophagy promoted neurodegeneration in this mouse model (cao et al., 2006). sim-
ilarly, in a model of ad, the ps/app mouse, inhibiting autophagic proteolysis with
leupeptin promotes neurodegeneration at inhibitor doses that do not similarly aﬀect
neurons in wild-type mice (nixon et al., 2001). stimulating proteolysis within avs
may be beneﬁcial in states of autophagy impairment (butler et al., 2005). hunting-
ton’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by gene mutations that encode
abnormally long sequences of polyglutamine in the protein, huntingtin (htt). when
overexpressed in cells, mutant htt accumulates in autophagic compartments in
amounts proportionate to the length of the polyglutamine sequence in the protein
(kegel et al., 2000), suggesting that its turnover by autophagy is impeded. inhibiting
the formation of autophagosomes or impeding their fusion with lysosomes (raviku-
mar et al., 2005) increases htt aggregation in cells in vitro and in vivo. by contrast,
stimulating autophagy with rapamycin treatment reduces htt accumulation and neu-
rodegeneration in cell and ﬂy models of polyglutamine disease and reduces neurolog-
ical deﬁcits and htt aggregation in a mouse model of huntington’s disease
(ravikumar et al., 2004); this suggests that inadequate levels of autophagy contrib-
ute to the complex neuronal cell death pattern in this disease (hickey and chesselet,
2003).
2. conclusion
the scarcity of autophagic vacuoles in a normal functioning brain yet their
appearance in states of disease has previously led many to assume that autophagy
in neurons is mainly an inducible process that is associated with neurodegenera-
tion. recent studies, however, clearly demonstrate that autophagy is constitutively
active in neurons, and is required for neuron survival. ongoing autophagic turn-
over of proteins in neurons that proceeds in the absence of readily detectable auto-
phagic vacuole intermediates, implies that the autophagic pathway is exceptionally
eﬃcient in healthy neurons. this conclusion is reinforced by evidence that avs
rapidly accumulate when late steps in the autophagy pathway are blocked. an
important implication from these observations is that autophagic vacuole accumu-
lation in neurodegenerative disease states often signiﬁes a failing autophagy system
rather than simply an activation of autophagy as is frequently proposed. new evi-
dence supports potential links between autophagic failure and neurodegeneration
in several major neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer’s disease. contin-
uing research eﬀorts that explore the role of autophagy in neurons will provide a
better understanding of its complex involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. to
date, therapeutic strategies based on facilitating eﬃcient autophagy show glimpses
of promise in neurodegenerative disease models
(ravikumar et al., 2004).
therefore, there is hope that future therapies aimed at maintaining balanced auto-
phagic activity in neurons will prove eﬀective in preventing some forms of
neurodegeneration.
