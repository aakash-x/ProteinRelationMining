protein quality-control, especially the removal of proteins with
aberrant structures, has an important role in maintaining
the homeostasis of non-dividing neural cells1. in addition to the
ubiquitin–proteasome system, emerging evidence points to the
importance of autophagy—the bulk protein degradation pathway
involved in starvation-induced and constitutive protein turn-
over—in the protein quality-control process2,3. however, little is
known about the precise roles of autophagy in neurons. here we
report that loss of atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a gene essential for
autophagy, leads to neurodegeneration. we found that mice
lacking atg7 speciﬁcally in the central nervous system showed
behavioural defects, including abnormal limb-clasping reﬂexes
and a reduction in coordinated movement, and died within 28
weeks of birth. atg7 deﬁciency caused massive neuronal loss in the
cerebral and cerebellar cortices. notably, polyubiquitinated pro-
teins accumulated in autophagy-deﬁcient neurons as inclusion
bodies, which increased in size and number with ageing. there
was, however, no obvious alteration in proteasome function. our
results indicate that autophagy is essential for the survival of
neural cells, and that impairment of autophagy is implicated in the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders involving ubiquitin-
containing inclusion bodies.
macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolu-
tionarily conserved pathway in which the cytoplasm and organelles
are engulfed within double-membraned vesicles, known as autopha-
gosomes, in preparation for the turnover and recycling of these
cellular constituents4. genetic studies using various model organisms
have highlighted the importance of autophagy in physiological and
pathological events5. the principal role of autophagy is in the supply
of nutrients for survival, as shown in yeast6 and early neonatal mice7,8.
autophagy also has a role in cellular remodelling during differen-
tiation and the development of multicellular organisms, such as
dauer formation in caenorhabditis elegans9 and metamorphosis in
drosophila melanogaster10. moreover, constitutive autophagy, which
occurs independently of nutrient stress, contributes to mouse liver
homeostasis8, major histocompatibility class (mhc) ii antigen
presentation11, and cellular defence against invading streptococci12
and mycobacterium tuberculosis13. however, the physiological func-
tions of autophagy, particularly in neurons, are still largely unknown.
to examine the relationship between neuronal pathology and
autophagy deﬁciency in vivo, we crossed atg7-conditional knockout
mice (atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox) (ref. 8) with transgenic mice expressing cre
recombinase under the control of the nestin promoter (nestin-cre)
(ref. 14), to produce mice deﬁcient for atg7 speciﬁcally in the central
nervous system (atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre). atg7 is an e1-like enzyme
for both the atg12- and atg8-conjugation systems15, and is essential

for autophagy8. atg7 protein was absent at postnatal day (p)28 in
brain from atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre but not control (atg7 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-
cre) mice (fig. 1a). the level of atg7 protein in other tissues such as
liver, lung, heart and muscle was comparable between atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox;
nestin-cre and control mice (data not shown). atg12–atg5 conjugate
was detected only in the brains of control mice by immunoblotting
with an anti-atg5 antibody (fig. 1a). in contrast, free atg5, which
was faintly observed in the control mouse brain, was clearly increased
in the mutant brain (fig. 1a). the mammalian homologue of yeast
atg8, microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (lc3), exists in
two forms (lc3-i and lc3-ii)16. both forms were detected in brains
from control mice, but only the lc3-i form was detected in atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox;
nestin-cre brain (fig. 1a). the loss of both atg7 and lc3-ii proteins
was observed from p0 in the brain of atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice
(supplementary fig. s1). these results indicate complete impair-
ment of autophagy in the central nervous system of atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox;
nestin-cre mice after birth.
atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice were viable at birth and indistinguish-
able in appearance from their littermates. however, the survival rate
of the mutant mice diminished markedly by four weeks after birth,
and all atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice were dead within 28 weeks
(fig. 1b). we also observed growth retardation as early as p14 in
these mice (data not shown). furthermore, the mice showed motor
and behavioural deﬁcits, including abnormal limb-clasping reﬂexes
(fig. 1c) and tremor, and in some cases, they walked on their tiptoes.
in a rotarod test, most atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice fell after grasping
the rod only brieﬂy (fig. 1d). these motor and behavioural deﬁcits
began to appear at p14–p21. these results suggest that autophagy
deﬁciency in the central nervous system results in a severe neuro-
logical disorder.
histological analysis using meyer’s haematoxylin and eosin (h&e)
staining showed marked atrophy of the cerebral cortical region of
atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre brain at p56 (fig. 2a, b). the ratios of cortical
thickness to dorsoventral thickness of the brain in atg7 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-
cre and atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice were 0.17 ^ 0.00031 and
0.15 ^ 0.00034, respectively (n ¼ 5, p , 0.01). notably, almost no
large pyramidal neurons were observed in atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre
mice compared with the corresponding region in brains from control
mice (fig. 2c, d). immunostaining for the glial marker gfap (glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein) showed an increase in gfap signal in the
cerebral cortex of atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice (fig. 2e, f), suggesting
the presence of neuronal damage in this region. in the cerebellar

j). similar neuronal
to determine whether the reduced number of neurons observed in
atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mouse brain was caused by cell death, we
performed tunel (tdt-mediated dutp nick end labelling) assays.
we observed a marked increase in the number of tunel-positive
cells in the cerebral cortex (fig. 2k–m) and granular cell layer of the
cerebellum at p56 in atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice (fig. 2n–p) com-
pared with control mouse brains. although loss of purkinje cells was
observed in the mutant brain, we could not detect tunel-positive
purkinje cells at any developmental stage examined. however, when
atg7 was speciﬁcally depleted in purkinje cells using transgenic mice
expressing cre recombinase under the control of the pcp2 gene
promoter (pcp2-cre), a marked reduction in the number of purkinje
cells was detected in the absence of tunel reactivity (data not
shown), suggesting that neurons deﬁcient in autophagy can die in a
cell-autonomous fashion. together, these results indicate that lack of
autophagy in the central nervous system leads to neurodegeneration.
we have previously reported that autophagy is responsible for
constitutive protein turnover in quiescent hepatocytes even under
nutrient-rich conditions, and that a defect in autophagy leads to the
accumulation of large, ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies8. we
therefore probed brain sections with an anti-ubiquitin antibody to
examine the presence of ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies. at
p56, ubiquitin-positive dots were detected in several regions of the
atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mouse brain, including the cerebral cortex
(fig. 3b), cerebellar purkinje cells (fig. 3d), hippocampal pyramidal
neurons (fig. 3f), thalamus (data not shown), hypothalamus
(fig. 3h), amygdala (fig. 3j) and pontine nuclei (fig. 3l). the degree
of staining varied by region. for example, whereas most neuronal

cells in the amygdala (fig. 3j) and hypothalamus (fig. 3h) contained
several ubiquitin dots of small to large size, only a small number of
cerebellar purkinje cells stained for ubiquitin, and the immuno-
reactive dots were of small size (fig. 3d). electron microscopy
showed that atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre hypothalamic neurons had
circular or elliptical large structures composed of ﬁbrillar elements
in the perikarya (fig. 3m, n). immunoelectron microscopy further
conﬁrmed that these aberrant structures contained ubiquitin
(fig. 3o). these ubiquitin dots appeared not only in the perikarya
of neurons, but also in the intercellular space (see fig. 3h, j, l). dots
found in the intercellular space might correspond to ubiquitin inside
neurites, because they were observed in myelinated axons around
pontine nuclei using both light and electron microscopy (sup-
plementary fig. s3a, b). in contrast, almost no ubiquitin dots were
observed in astroglial cells (supplementary fig. s3c). together with
the results in fig. 3, we concluded that most of the distinct ubiquitin
dots were located in neurons.
we examined the development of ubiquitin-containing inclusion
bodies at different stages by dissecting the brains of atg7 ﬂox/þ
; nestin-
cre and atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice at p9, p18 and p56. only a few
ubiquitin-positive aggregates were noted in the neurons of control and
mutant cerebral cortex and hypothalamus at p9 (fig. 3p, q). in
contrast, several ubiquitin-containing inclusions were clearly noted
in atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre cortex and hypothalamus at p18, increasing
in number and size by p56 (fig. 3p, q). these results indicate an
age-dependent increase in ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies in
autophagy-deﬁcient neurons. consistent with the above immunohis-
tochemical analysis (fig. 3p, q), immunoblot analysis revealed increas-
ing levels of high-molecular-mass polyubiquitinated proteins with age
in the brains of atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice (fig. 4a), and an increase in
their insoluble forms at later developmental stages (data not shown).
finally, we examined whether autophagy deﬁciency inﬂuences
proteasome functions. the chymotryptic activities of 26s and 20s
proteasomes (measured using suc-llvy-mca as a substrate) were
comparable in extracts from both control and atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre
brains (fig. 4b). furthermore, the atp-dependent degradation of
ornithine decarboxylase (odc) by 26s proteasomes was similar in
control and mutant brains (fig. 4c). moreover, the relative amounts
of several subunits of the 26s proteasome did not change in the brain
irrespective of autophagy deﬁciency (as detected by immunoblotting,
fig. 4d). these results indicate that age-dependent accumulation of
ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the autophagy-deﬁcient brain
occurs despite the apparently normal function of proteasomes.
over the past decade, researchers working in the ﬁeld of neuro-
degenerative diseases have made great progress in uncovering the
mechanisms of these disorders by focusing on the interplay between
proteolytic stress and neural cell death17,18. increasing evidence
indicates that ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies—the pathological
hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases—are formed by
dysfunction of proteasome degrading machinery3. indeed, proteins
with aberrant structure impair proteasome functions directly, thus
attenuating ‘garbage disposal’19. on the other hand, the accumu-
lation of autophagosomes owing to impairment of fusion with
lysosomes is observed in various disorders, including alzheimer’s
disease20–22, and it has been proposed that autophagy functions to
degrade toxic proteins in familial neurodegenerative diseases23–25.
however, it remains unknown whether these two proteolytic systems
work independently or cooperatively to maintain protein homeo-
stasis in cells. furthermore, whether autophagy has a role in cell
death or cell survival is currently under debate26.
we have shown that atg7 ﬂox/ﬂox; nestin-cre mice exhibit neuro-
logical abnormalities and neuronal death, suggesting that impaired
autophagy causes neurodegeneration. we suggest a particularly
important role for autophagy in the brain, to which nutrients must
be constantly supplied from other organs, even under fasting
conditions. moreover, we ﬁnd that autophagy deﬁciency in neurons
leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies,

activity of proteasomes using suc-llvy-amc as a substrate in the absence
(top) or presence (bottom) of 0.05% sds. the sedimenting positions of 20s
and 26s proteasomes are indicated with arrowheads. note that whereas 26s

without obvious deﬁcits in proteasome function. hence, our data
indicate a central role for constitutive autophagy in the elimination
of unfavourable proteins and in the survival of neurons, independent
of the proteasome system (see the proposed model in supplementary
fig. s4). although we do not know whether autophagy and proteasome
degradation target a similar set of normal and/or misfolded proteins, it
is plausible that the autophagic pathway assists in degrading accumu-
lated intractable proteins when cellular levels of aberrant proteins
overwhelm the disposal capacity of the proteasome.
we have shown that a lack of autophagy is associated with
neurodegeneration, even in the absence of harmful gene products
found in neurodegenerative disorders such as huntington’s disease,
parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. we therefore
predict that the role of autophagy becomes even more critical in the
pathogenesis of such neurodegenerative diseases, when disease-
related, aggregation-prone proteins are expressed as a result of
genetic mutations and/or environmental insults, leading to early-
onset symptoms.
