abstract
(cid:2)
the effect of seven natural prenylated ﬂavones in dna synthesis of two human breast cancer cell lines, the estrogen-dependent
er (+) mcf-7 and the estrogen-independent er (−) mda-mb-231 cells, was evaluated. flavones with an isopentenyl group at c-8
and a ring linking c-3 and c-2
presented a biphasic effect in dna synthesis of er (+) mcf-7 and displayed a stimulation at low
concentrations (0.02–0.78 ␮m) whilst at higher concentrations (>3.12 ␮m) inhibition was observed. no stimulation was observed
in er (−) mda-mb-231. in contrast, all the ﬂavones exhibited an antiproliferative effect in both er (−) and er (+). curiously,
the inhibition of dna synthesis was accompanied by a high capacity of these cells to reduce mtt, which was concurrent with the
appearance of an intense intracytoplasmic vacuolization. the accumulation of the formazan product in these vacuoles could justify
the enhancements of mtt reduction. the characterization of these vacuoles with the autophagic marker monodansylcadaverine
(mdc) is consistent with autophagic vacuoles, which led to the suggestion that these ﬂavones could induce autophagy in both er
(+) and er (−) breast cancer cell lines.

activities affecting various cellular systems (middleton
et al., 2000). the antiproliferative activity of ﬂavonoids
is well documented and has been extensively studied
in several human tumor cell lines (kuntz et al., 1999;
harborne and williams, 2000; middleton et al., 2000).
however, studies on estrogen-dependent human breast
cancer cell lines showed that some ﬂavonoids, depend-
ing on the concentration used, exhibited a proliferative
effect in addition to antiproliferative activity (wang and
kurzer, 1997). this growth promoting effect has been
attributed to an estrogen activity. the most well-known

naturally occurring ﬂavonoid with estrogen activity is
the isoﬂavone genistein which has been shown to com-
pete with estradiol for the estrogen receptor (wang et
al., 1996). this kind of similarity between ﬂavonoids
and estrogens explains the extensive research under-
taken in recent years on this group of compounds for
estrogen–antiestrogen activities.
most studies involving phytoestrogens use the
estrogen-dependent er (+) mcf-7 human cancer cell
line (schmitt et al., 2001; kinjo et al., 2004; murata
et al., 2004) in parallel with the estrogen-independent
er (−) mda-mb-231 cells to prove the dependence
of the stimulatory effect of these compounds on the
estrogen receptors (wang and kurzer, 1997; schmitt et
al., 2001; rowlands et al., 2002). in the er (+) mcf-
7 cells phytoestrogens normally exhibited a biphasic
effect, which is expressed by a stimulatory effect on cell
growth at low concentrations and an inhibitory effect at
high concentrations (wang and kurzer, 1997). while the
stimulatory effect of phytoestrogens seems to be medi-
ated via estrogen receptors, the antiproliferative effect
appears to involve an er-independent cellular mech-
anisms (collins-burow et al., 2000). most studies on
the evaluation of the proliferative and antiproliferative
properties of phytoestrogens use dna synthesis or mtt
assays (wang and kurzer, 1998; wang and lou, 2004).
however, the mtt assay may represent a pitfall in mea-
suring the antiproliferative effect because increases in
cellular mtt-reducing activity have been reported in the
presence of cell growth inhibition (bernhard et al., 2003).
the mechanism of mtt reduction is far from being clear.
although the reduction in mtt is generally attributed to
mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, nonmitochon-
drial enzymes have also been implicated (berridge and
tan, 1993). moreover, mtt reduction in the intracellular
vesicles, identiﬁed as endosomes and lisossomes formed
during the autophagic process, was reported (liu et al.,
1997).
in previous work, while studying the cytotoxic effect
of artelastin, a prenylated ﬂavone isolated from arto-
carpus elasticus, on mcf-7 cells (kijjoa et al., 1996)
it was noticed that this compound exhibited a biphasic
effect in dna synthesis of this er (+) breast cancer
cell line (pedro et al., 2005) which was stimulatory at
low concentrations and inhibitory at high concentrations,
resembling the effect of phytoestrogens. curiously, we
found that concentrations of artelastin responsible for an
antiproliferative effect were associated with an increased
capacity of cells to reduce mtt, at the same time caus-
ing massive cytoplasmic vacuolization. these previous
results prompted us to undertake a more thorough study
of some of these ﬁndings. consequently the aims of the
present work were: (i) to evaluate if the biphasic effect
exhibited by artelastin in dna synthesis was equally
present in a er (−) breast cancer cell line; (ii) to extend
the investigation of the effect in dna synthesis to other
prenylated ﬂavones (fig. 1), also isolated from a. elas-
ticus (kijjoa et al., 1996, 1998; cidade et al., 2001) and
structurally related to artelastin; (iii) to evaluate if the
cytoplasmic vacuolization induced by ﬂavone treatment
was responsible for the increases detected in the cellular
mtt reduction capacity; (iv) to evaluate if the cyto-
plasmic vacuoles could be related with the autophagic
process.
2. material and methods
2.1. reagents
rpmi-1640, fetal bovine serum (fbs), l-glutamine, gen-
tamicin and trypsin were supplied from gibco invitrogen
co. (scotland, uk). trypan blue, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt), dimethyl sulfox-
ide (dmso) and monodansylcadaverine (mdc) were from
sigma–aldrich co. (saint louis, u.s.a.). sodium dode-
cyl sulfate (sds), entellan, methanol, paraformaldehyde and
hemacolor® were sourced from merck (darmstadt, germany),
[3h]-thymidine from amersham (illinois, u.s.a.), dimethyl-
formamide (dmf) from romil chemicals (england) and scin-
tillation liquid from perkin-elmer (boston, u.s.a.).
2.2. plant material
a detailed description of the isolation, puriﬁcation and iden-
tiﬁcation of the seven prenylated ﬂavones from the wood of a.
elasticus, are published elsewhere (kijjoa et al., 1996, 1998;
cidade et al., 2001). the purity of compounds was assessed
to de ≥99% (hplc). a stock solution of each ﬂavone was
prepared in dmso and kept at −20
c. appropriate dilu-
tions of ﬂavones were freshly prepared just prior the different
assays.
2.3. cell cultures
two human breast cancer cell lines were used, the er (+)
mcf-7 and the er (−) mda-mb-231. the mcf-7 cell line
was provided by the national cancer institute (nci, bethesda,
u.s.a.) and mda-mb-231 was obtained from the ameri-
can type culture collection (atcc, manassas, u.s.a.). cells
were grown as monolayers and maintained in rpmi-1640
medium supplemented with 5% or 10% heat-inactivated fbs
for mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 respectively, 2 mm glutamine
and 50 ␮g/ml of gentamicin, at 37
c in a humidiﬁed atmo-
sphere with 5% co2.
the exponential growing mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells
were obtained by plating 1.5× 105cells/ml followed by 24 h
incubation. the effect of the vehicle solvent (dmso) was eval-

uated in all experiments by exposing untreated control cells to
the maximum concentration (0.3%) of dmso used in each
assay.
2.4. dna synthesis assay
mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells growing exponentially in
96-well microplates were treated with a range of concentrations
0.02–50 ␮m or 0.04–50 ␮m, respectively, of each prenylated
ﬂavone for 6, 12 and 24 h. after treatment, 1 ␮ci of [3h] thymi-
dine was added and cells were incubated for a further 4 h.
pulsed cells were then harvested on a glass ﬁlter 102× 256 mm
(skatron, norway) using a semiautomatic cell harvester (ska-
tron instruments, norway) and allowed to dry. incorporation
of radioactive thymidine was determined by liquid scintilla-
tion in a scintillation counter (ls 6500, beckman instruments,
ca, u.s.a.) and deﬁned by comparing the arithmetic mean
of counts per minute (cpm) of treated cells with that of the
untreated control cells.
2.5. mtt assay
mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells growing exponentially in
96-well microplates were treated with a range of concentrations
(0.02-50 ␮m) of each prenylated ﬂavone for 6, 12 and 24 h.
after treatment, mtt was added (0.5 mg/ml) and cells were
incubated for a further 4 h. formazan products were solubilized
with sds/dmf solution (20% sds in 50% dmf, ph 4.7)
overnight at 37
c. absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a
plate reader (ear 400, stl-labinstruments). the percentage
of mtt reduction was calculated comparing the absorbance
of treated cells to that of untreated control cells.
2.6. trypan blue exclusion assay
mcf-7 cells growing exponentially in 6-well plates, were
treated with 25 ␮m for 6 h of each prenylated ﬂavone. mda-
mb-231 cells were only treated with 25 and 50 ␮m arte-
lastin for 6 h. after treatment, attached cells were released by

trypsinization and mixed with non-adherent cells. cells were
then stained with 0.2% trypan blue and viable and non-viable
cells were counted in a hemocytometer. results were expressed
in terms of percentage of viable cells in the total cell number.
2.7. cell morphologic analysis
mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells growing exponentially in
coverslips were treated respectively, with 25 and 50 ␮m of each
ﬂavone for 6 h. after treatment cells were ﬁxed with methanol
and stained with hemacolor® according to the supplier’s rec-
ommended protocol. slides were mounted in entellan and
observed under a light microscope.
2.8. mdc staining of cytoplasmatic vacuoles
cytoplasmic vacuoles were stained with mdc according
to the method described elsewhere (biederbick et al., 1995).
mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells growing exponentially in cov-
erslips were treated with 25 ␮m or 50 ␮m of artelastin for
6 h, respectively. cells were then exposed to 50 ␮m of mdc
for 1 h at 37
c and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. slides
were observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (eclipse e400
nikon, japan).
3. results
3.1. effect of prenylated ﬂavones in dna synthesis
of er (+) mcf-7 cells
the effects of increasing concentrations of the seven
prenylated ﬂavones in dna synthesis of the estrogen
sensitive er (+) mcf-7 cell line were evaluated. for this
purpose, exponentially growing cells were treated with a
broad concentration range (0.02–50 ␮m) of the different
ﬂavones, for 6, 12 and 24 h and dna synthesis quan-
tiﬁed by thymidine incorporation. the dose-response
proﬁle obtained (fig. 2) showed that artelastin (2), arte-
lastocarpin (3), artelastochromene (4) and carpelastofu-
ran (7) exerted a biphasic effect in dna synthesis of
mcf-7 cells, expressed by a stimulatory effect at low
concentrations and an inhibitory effect at high concen-
trations. this stimulatory effect was mainly observed
for concentrations between 0.02 and 0.78 ␮m and expo-
sure periods of 6 and 12 h. maximum stimulations were
obtained with artelastocarpin (3) and carpelastofuran
(7) after 6 h treatment, reaching values of 150% and
200% after exposure to 0.09 and 0.05 ␮m, respectively.
artelastochromene (4) and artelastin (2) also induced
increases of 140% and 130% after 12 h treatment with
0.39 and 0.78 ␮m, respectively. twenty-four hours treat-
ments were never associated with a stimulatory effect.
this cell growth promoting effect was, however, abruptly
lost and replaced by a growth inhibitory effect when
treatments were performed with concentrations greater
than 3.12 ␮m, independently of the exposure time used.
at concentrations above 25 ␮m all compounds, except
artocarpesin (6), caused a complete stop in dna synthe-
sis. curiously, ﬂavones 2, 3, 4 and 7 that exhibited the
biphasic effect have two structural features in common,
an isopentenyl at c-8 and an additional ring linking c-
3 and c-2
on their skeleton. these features seem to be
important for the biphasic effect since they are absent in
ﬂavones 1, 5 and 6, which did not show this effect.
(cid:2)
3.2. effect of prenylated ﬂavones in dna synthesis
of er (−) mda-mb-231 cells
to determine if the biphasic effect detected in dna
synthesis of er (+) mcf-7 cells was equally present
in a er (−) breast cancer cell line, the mda-mb-231
cell line was exposed to the same serial range con-
centrations of the seven ﬂavones for 6, 12 and 24 h.
the dose-response proﬁles obtained with this estrogen-
independent cell line (fig. 3) showed that treatments with
low concentrations (0.04–0.78 ␮m) and short exposure
times (6 and 12 h) did not stimulate dna synthesis. only
the inhibitory effect associated with high concentrations
(>10 ␮m) was observed with this cell line.
since the stimulation of dna synthesis was only
observed in the er (+) mcf-7 cells, this could suggest
that the growth promoting effect (proliferation) exhibited
by these ﬂavones could be related with the presence of
estrogen receptors. in contrast the antiproliferative effect
that was observed in both er (+) and er (−) cell lines
seems not to be related with their presence.
3.3. effect of prenylated ﬂavones in mtt reducing
capacity of er (+) mcf-7 and er (−)
mda-mb-231 cells
the proliferative and antiproliferative effects of these
prenylated ﬂavones were also investigated by the widely
used mtt cell proliferation assay (mosmann, 1983).
the effects of increasing concentrations of these ﬂavones
on the mtt reducing capacity of er (+) mcf-7 and er
(−) mda-mb-231 cells after exposures for 6, 12 and
24 h are shown in figs. 4 and 5, respectively.
no enhancements in mtt reducing activity were
observed in mcf-7 cells after treatments with low con-
centrations (0.02–0.78 ␮m) and short exposure times (6
and 12 h). however, this did not agree with the prolifera-
tive effect detected previous by the thymidine incorpora-
tion assay. furthermore, high concentrations associated
with the inhibition of dna synthesis (>3.12 ␮m) were
also associated with an increased capacity of cells to

imum values of 145% and 142% respectively, after 6 h
treatment with 12.5 ␮m artelastin (2) and 50 ␮m artelas-
tochromene (4), concentrations that were responsible for
drastic decreases in dna synthesis. in mda-mb-231
cells, this increase in mtt reducing capacity was also
observed with growth inhibitory concentrations. maxi-
mum values of 148% were registered for treatments with
25 and 50 ␮m for artelastin (2) and carpelastofuran (7)
for 6 h.

obtained from the dna synthesis assay. it was surprising

that the increase in dna synthesis observed in mcf-7
cells was not accompanied by an enhancement in the
cellular mtt reduction capacity indicative of cellular
proliferation. moreover, the decline in dna synthesis
caused by high concentrations was associated with an
increase in mtt reduction levels instead of a decrease,
as expected. these discrepancies led us to investigate
the cause of this intense formazan production in cells
that had their dna synthesis dramatically affected. a
direct reduction of mtt by the prenylated ﬂavones was
excluded as the cause of this enhanced formazan pro-
duction since these compounds showed no capacity to
reduce this tetrazolium salt at any concentration used
(data not shown). however, microscopic observation of

cells showed an intense vacuolization mainly in cells
treated with 25 ␮m for 6 h, which was not detected in
untreated control cells (fig. 6). large vacuoles that occu-
pied almost all the cytoplasm and remained uncoloured
after staining with hemacolor® were visualized in cells
treated with artelasticin (1), artelastin (2), artelastocarpin
(3), artelastochromene (4) and carpelastofuran (7). curi-
ously, these ﬂavones have in common an isopentenyl
group at c-8. this type of morphologic alteration was
not observed in cells treated with artelastofuran (5) and
artocarpesin (6), ﬂavones without the prenyl group at c-
8. this intracytoplasmic vacuolization was also detected
in mda-mb-231 cells, but higher concentrations (50 m)
of ﬂavones were needed to induce them (fig. 6). a 6 h

treatment with 25 ␮m artelastin was unable to induce the
appearance of vacuoles. as with the mcf-7 cell line the
vacuolization of mda-mb-231 cells was only observed
after treatments with ﬂavones possessing an isopentenyl
group at c-8. in spite of the intense intracellular vac-
uolization, the viability of mcf-7 and mda-mb-231
remained very high (>75%) as determined by trypan blue
exclusion dye.
based on the knowledge that mtt is also reduced
in intracellular vesicles and that these vesicles accumu-
late the reduced formazan product (liu et al., 1997)
we hypothesized that the enhancements of formazan
detected after ﬂavone treatments, could be due to an
accumulation of the mtt reduced product in the large
vacuoles induced by these compounds. to prove this, we
selected one of the treatments that caused the greatest

bated with mtt for 4 h and immediately observed by
light microscopy (fig. 7). as expected, an intense accu-
mulation of violet-coloured formazan conﬁned to the
large cytoplasmic vacuoles was observed, which could
explain the enhancements in mtt reduction detected.

the above results prompted us to undertake a more
detailed characterization of the cytoplasmic vacuoles
detected. since, similar vacuoles have been described
in the autophagic process, we characterized the vacuoles
induced by artelastin (2) in mcf-7 and mda-mb-231
cells with the autophagic marker mdc (biederbick et
al., 1995). for this purpose, after artelastin treatment,
cells were stained with mdc and immediately analyzed
by ﬂuorescent microscopy (fig. 8). fluorescent dot-like
structures, characteristic of mdc-positive cells, were

4. discussion
in the present study we started to characterize the
nature of the biphasic effect in dna synthesis, detected
in previous work, in the human breast cancer cell line
mcf-7 after treatment with artelastin, a natural preny-
lated ﬂavone isolated from a. elasticus (pedro et al.,
2005). this biphasic effect was indicated by enhance-
ments of dna synthesis at low concentrations and an
inhibitory effect at high concentrations, resembling the
behavior described for phytoestrogens on er (+) breast
cancer cells (wang and kurzer, 1997, 1998). this led us
to hypothesize that the effect of artelastin on the er (+)
mcf-7 breast cell line could be related to the presence
of estrogen receptors and motivated us to study the effect
of a range of low and high concentrations of artelastin
together with the inﬂuence of exposure time in dna syn-
thesis of mcf-7 cells. the effect of artelastin was also
studied on the er (−) mda-mb-231 breast cancer cell
line in order to evaluate if this biphasic effect was equally
present in this cell line. this investigation was extended
to a group of six more natural prenylated ﬂavones,
structurally related to artelastin and also isolated from
a. elasticus. results showed that besides artelastin (2)
the compounds, artelastocarpin (3), artelastochromene
(4) and carpelastofuran (7) induced a biphasic effect
in dna synthesis of er (+) mcf-7 cells. curiously,
no stimulation in dna synthesis was observed with
artelasticin (1), artelastofuran (5) and artocarpesin (6),
which led us to conclude that some structural feature
might be related with the growth promoting effect of
34
m. pedro et al. / toxicology letters 164 (2006) 24–36
the former prenylated ﬂavones. although it is difﬁcult
to draw a structure activity relationship from this small
group of compounds, from our data it was possible
to observe that the presence of an isopentenyl group
(cid:2)
at c-8 and an additional ring linking c-3 and c-2
in compounds 2, 3, 4 and 7 were associated with the
appearance of the growth-promoting effect. estrogenic
properties of some prenylﬂavonoids have been ascribed
to the isopentenyl group at position 8, which has been
shown to be crucial for their estrogenic activity, namely
for 8-prenylnaringenin (kitaoka et al., 1998; miyamoto
et al., 1998) which is the most potent phytoestrogen
described to date (schaefer et al., 2003; zierau et al.,
2004; zierau et al., 2005). the presence and position
of 8-prenyl group was shown by others to participate
in hydrophobic interactions with the estrogen receptor,
since a change of this group to another position results in
a loss of estrogenic binding activity (kitaoka et al., 1998;
harborne and williams, 2000). the 8-prenylnaringenin
represents one of the best examples of the importance
of the isopentenyl group at c-8 in a key position on the
ﬂavonoid framework and is in agreement with our data.
but if a growth stimulation effect was detected on
er (+) mcf-7 no stimulation in dna synthesis was
observed in the er (−) mda-mb-231 cells. this
absence of growth promoting effect in this estrogen-
independent breast cancer cell line together with the
proliferative effect detected on the er (+) mcf-7 cells
could suggest an involvement of the estrogen receptors in
the proliferative effect of the ﬂavones under study, which
is consistent with the known estrogenic activity of the
phytoestrogens (peterson and barnes, 1991; wang and
kurzer, 1997; zava and duwe, 1997). however, more
studies are needed to assess the estrogenic activity of
these ﬂavones that would imply the use of e-screen assay
and of other more speciﬁc tests such as the reporter gene
assay and the er binding assay.
in contrast to the growth-promoting effect associated
with low concentrations, higher concentrations of the
ﬂavones studied (>3.12 ␮m) were shown to inhibit the
proliferation of both er (+) mcf-7 and er (−) mda-
mb-231 breast cancer cells. the antiproliferative effect
of these ﬂavones (1–7) has also been demonstrated in
several non-breast tumor cell lines and on human lym-
phocytes (cidade et al., 2001; cerqueira et al., 2003),
which point out that cell growth inhibition induced by
these ﬂavones occurs through different molecular mech-
anisms not involving estrogen receptors. the mecha-
nisms underlying the growth inhibitory effect of these
prenylated ﬂavones are unknown, but artelastin has been
shown to interfere with dna replication, causing an
accumulation in s phase and hampering cell cycle pro-
gression, while disturbing the microtubule network in
mcf-7 cells (pedro et al., 2005).
the effects of the prenylated ﬂavones (1–7) in mcf-
7 and mda-mb-231 cells were also evaluated by the
mtt assay, a valid alternative method to the [3h]
thymidine uptake method for analyzing cell proliferation
(mosmann, 1983). it was surprising that treatments with
high concentrations that have markedly affected dna
synthesis were associated with enhancements in cellular
mtt reduction capacity in both cell lines. a direct reduc-
tion of mtt described for some ﬂavonoids (bruggisser
et al., 2002), could explain the increases detected. since
the prenylated ﬂavones under study (1–7) showed no
capacity to reduce this tetrazolium salt this hypothesis
was excluded. increases of the cellular mtt-reducing
activity in the presence of growth inhibition have also
been reported by others (pagliacci et al., 1993; bernhard
et al., 2003) and represent a pitfall in the mtt prolifera-
tion assay. this false negative result would have lead to
the conclusion that our prenylated ﬂavones did not affect
cell growth. the antiproliferative effect of these com-
pounds would have been missed if only the mtt assay
was used. despite the great use of mtt assay, the cellular
mechanism of mtt reduction is poorly understood. the
exclusive role of mitochondria in cellular mtt reduc-
tion has been questioned (berridge and tan, 1993) and
the exact cellular site and enzymes involved is far from
being clariﬁed. it was demonstrated that mtt can be
reduced in intracellular vesicles, many of which were
identiﬁed as endosomes and lisossomes, with autophagy
being suggested as a possible mechanism for the accu-
mulation of the mtt formazan product in these vesicles
(liu et al., 1997). autophagy is the process by which
a cell sequesters part of its cytosol and intracellular
organelles and then delivers them to the lisossome for
degradation (dunn, 1990a, 1990b). we showed that the
enhancements in mtt reduction observed in ﬂavones
treated cells were accompanied by an intense vacuoliza-
tion of the cytoplasm and that the mtt formazan product
was accumulated in these cytoplasmic vacuoles. this
accumulation could explain the observed increases in
mtt reduction. this vacuolization was observed in both
er (+) mcf-7 and er (−) mda-mb-231 cells. the
appearance of vacuoles seems to be associated with the
presence of the isopentenyl group at c-8 since they were
only detected in cells treated with ﬂavones containing
this feature. in spite of the intense intracellular vac-
uolization mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells displayed
a high viability. given the similar appearance between
the ﬂavones induced vesicles and autophagic vacuoles
added to the high viability of cells, led us to think that
we might have encountered compounds with the capac-
m. pedro et al. / toxicology letters 164 (2006) 24–36

ity to induce autophagy. the characterization of these
vacuoles with the autophagic marker mdc showed a
granular pattern of ﬂuorescence that is consistent with
autophagossomes. however, more studies are needed to
prove if these prenylated ﬂavones are autophagic induc-
ers. if conﬁrmed this will give to these compounds new
perspective as candidates for breast cancer treatment.
in conclusion, in this work it was compared the prolif-
erative and the antiproliferative effects of natural preny-
lated ﬂavones in er (+) and er (−) breast cancer cell
lines with a speciﬁc focus on the variable results obtained
by two different methods of accessing cell proliferation,
[3h] thymidine and mtt assay. it was demonstrated
that among the prenylated ﬂavones under study (1–7)
only those possessing both an isopentenyl group at c-
8 and an additional ring linking c-3 and c-2
on their
skeleton (2, 3, 4 and 7) exhibited a proliferative effect
at low concentrations while at high concentrations they
all presented an antiproliferative effect which was inde-
pendent of these two structural features and detectable
in both er (+) and er (−) breast cancer cell line. this
antiproliferative effect was accompanied by an intense
cytoplasmic vacuolization that could be associated with
autophagy.
