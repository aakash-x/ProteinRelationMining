abstract
background: cell death constitutes one of the key events in biology. historically, apoptosis and necrosis
have been considered to represent the 2 fundamental forms of cell death. apoptosis is a tightly regulated,
energy-dependent process in which cell death follows a programmed set of events. necrosis refers to the
sum of degenerative changes that follow any type of cell death.
methods and results: the role of apoptosis in development of ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart
disease, and end-stage heart failure has been well documented. recent evidence suggests the potential role
of a third mechanism of cell death, autophagy, in loss of cardiac myocytes. autophagic cell death has been
recently documented in myocardial cells from hypertrophied, failing, and hibernating myocardium.
conclusion: in this review, we will list the basic mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagic cell death and
examine the recent developments in apoptosis and autophagic cell death as it pertains to cardiovascular
disease.
cell death constitutes one of the key events in biology.
cellular homeostasis is maintained by a balance between
the increase (by differentiation from precursors and by pro-
liferation), and decrease (by further differentiation and cell
death) in the number of a cell population. our understand-
ing of the mechanisms of cell death has vastly increased in
the last 30 years with advances in molecular genetics and
cell biology. the concept of cell death can be found in texts
dating back to the rime of galen around 200 ad. virchow,
in 1858, described what he called degeneration, necrosis,
and mortiﬁcation as a passive process. in 1885, fleming in-
troduced the idea of spontaneous cell death, by ﬁrst observ-
ing epithelial cell nuclei in regressing ovarian follicles that
appeared to be breaking apart. in 1910, von recklinghausen
described cell death accompanied by swelling in bone cells,
and coined the term oncosis.

historically, apoptosis and necrosis have been considered
to represent the 2 fundamental forms of cell death. initially
characterized as a counterbalancing physiologic process to
mitosis, in which internal signals activate a death program
(programmed cell death), apoptosis has now been recog-
nized as a process that also can be induced by external stim-
uli, either physiologic or pathologic.1,2 the term apoptosis
is greek for ‘‘dropping off,’ as with the leaves of a tree in
autumn. first described by kerr et al3 in 1971, apoptosis is
a tightly regulated, energy-dependent process in which cell
death follows a programmed set of events.4–7 apoptosis is
characterized morphologically by a pattern of nuclear pyk-
nosis (highly condensed chromatic, segregated into sharply
deﬁned bodies within an intact nuclear envelope), cytoplas-
mic condensation, and cell shrinkage, followed by nuclear
and cellular fragmentation and rapid phagocytosis of apo-
ptotic bodies by adjacent cells in the absence of exudative
inﬂammation.8,9 chromatin fragmentation in apoptosis in-
volves the activation or de novo synthesis of endonucleases
and is at least in part calcium dependent.10 the result of the
endonuclease activity is the cleavage of dna at linking re-
gions between nucleosomes resulting in formation of a se-
ries of double-stranded fragments that are multiples of 180
to 200 base pairs in length. when observed on gel electro-
phoresis, these fragments give a characteristic dna ladder
pattern.11 chromosomal dna fragmentation is considered
to be the hallmark of apoptosis.12,13 the most widely

used method for detection of double-stranded dna frag-
mentation is the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–me-
diated biotinylated dutp nick end-labeling (tunel)
method.14 apoptosis plays a critical role in both the normal
development and the pathology of a wide variety of tis-
sues.15,16 normal physiologic apoptosis is observed to oc-
cur during thymic involution17 or removal of autoreactive
lymphocytes during development18; however, inappropriate
apoptosis may contribute to development of neurodegener-
ative disease (eg, neurodegenerative disorders such as par-
kinson’s, alzheimer’s, and spinal muscular dystrophy)19,20
or aids.21
the term necrosis has been used for approximately 2000
years to deﬁne drastic tissue changes visible to the naked
eye.9 cell death by accidental causes such as heat was de-
ﬁned as ‘‘accidental cell death.’’22 wyllie et al17 deﬁned ne-
crosis as nonapoptotic, accidental cell death. majno and
joris9 suggested that rather than a type of cell death, necro-
sis refers to the sum of degenerative changes that follow
any type of cell death. necrosis is characterized by irrevers-
ible changes in the nucleus (karyolysis, pyknosis, and kar-
yorrhexis), and in the cytoplasm (condensation and intense
eosinophilia, loss of structure, and fragmentation).9 the ex-
act mechanisms of necrosis in humans are poorly under-
stood. recent studies in caenorhabditis elegans have
demonstrated that necrosis is carried out by speciﬁc cellular
pathways,23–26 suggesting that necrosis may not be entirely
‘‘accidental,’’ but rather part of programmed cell death.
table 1 summarizes the differences between apoptosis
and necrosis.
autophagic cell death occurs in many eukaryotic cell
types. it is a type of programmed cell death and has been
described both as a means to resist starvation, and as
a part of the cellular remodeling during differentiation,
metamorphosis, aging, cell
transformation, physiologic
whole-organ changes such as the growth of the uterus dur-
ing pregnancy, and its atrophy after childbirth, as well as
the removal of anomalous cellular components that accu-
mulate after toxic insults or during childbirth.27
the role of apoptosis in myocardial cell death has been
well documented over the last decade. recent studies sug-
gest the possible involvement of autophagic cell death in
loss of cardiac myocytes. in the following sections, we
will review the mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagic
cell death, with special interest given to their roles in myo-
cardial cell death.
apoptosis
central apoptotic machinery
apoptosis is mediated by 2 central pathways: the extrin-
sic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochon-
drial pathway.28 fig. 1 illustrates the central pathways of
apoptosis. caspases, a subclass of cysteine proteases that
cleave substrates after aspartic acid residues, are thought
to be the central executioners of the apoptotic pathway.29
caspases are highly conserved through evolution and can
be found from humans all the way down to insects, nema-
todes, and hydra.30–32 in humans, more than a dozen cas-
pases have been identiﬁed; roughly two thirds of which
have been suggested to function in apoptosis.32,33 all
known caspases possess an active-site cysteine and cleave
substrates at the asp-xxx bonds (after the aspartic acid res-
idues); a caspase’s distinct speciﬁcity is determined by the
4 residue amino-terminal to the cleavage site.32 as in most
proteases, caspases are synthesized as enzymatically inert
zymogens. these proenzymes usually undergo proteolysis
and activation by other caspases in a cascade.33

how do cardiomyocytes die?
caspases can functionally be classified into 3 classes. (1)
the initiator caspases, characterized by long prodomains
(90 amino acid residues), contain either death effector domains (caspase-8 and caspase-10), or a caspase recruitment
domain (caspase-2 and caspase-). both the caspase recruitment domain and death effector domains interact with complementary domains on adapter proteins that serve to
cluster the initiator caspases and to facilitate auto proteolysis. (2) the executioner or effector caspases containing
short prodomains (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7).
(3) the reminder of the caspases, which are mainly involved in cytokine maturation.34 once activated, initiator
caspases (upstream) cleave and activate effector caspases
(down stream), thus initiating a proteolytic cascade. this
system of activation enables rapid caspase mobilization
and cascade amplification, leading to rapid cell death via
apoptosis.35
regulation of caspase activity
as mentioned, activated caspases serve as central executioners of apoptosis in cells. there exists a subset of proteins that prevent the activation of pro-caspases, thus
inhibiting the activity of mature caspases to regulate apoptotic signaling. cellular fadd-like inhibiting protein
(c-flip) is a mammalian analog to the herpes virus faddlike inhibiting protein (v-flip) has been noted to protect
cells from apoptosis in human melanoma. the inhibitors
of apoptosis (iap) family of proteins,36,37 was identified
on the basis of a 35-kda baculoviral protein that suppressed
apoptosis in host-infected cells. several mammalian homologues have been identified, including x chromosome–linked
iap (xiap), cellular iap (ciap1), ciap2, and surviving,
with homology in baculoviral iap repeat (bir) domains
of approximately 80 residues containing a core zn21
atom. the best characterized of the iaps is xiap, which
inhibits the activities of processed forms of both initiator
caspases (eg, caspase-9) and effector caspases (caspase-3
and caspase-7).38
pathways of caspase activation
the extrinsic pathway. signal transduction via the
extrinsic/death receptor pathway is initiated by the binding
of extra cellular death signal proteins (tumor necrosis factor-a, fas l, trail, and apo-3l) to their cognate cell surface receptors.39–42 the cdna sequences of 5 death
receptors are known (table 2).43–48
each of the death receptors contain a cytosolic domain
known as death domains. after binding to their cognate

ligands, the death receptors form a homo-trimeric complex,
and with the help of death domain–mediated proteinprotein interactions, recruit intracellular adapter proteins to
the cell membrane, resulting in the formation of a multiprotein complex known as the death-inducing signaling complex
(disc).49–51 formation of the disc facilitates recruitment
and activation of caspase 8/10, which initiates the proteolytic
cascade.52
in fas signaling, the fas ligand binds to the fas death
receptor, causing receptor trimerization. this leads to recruitment of an adapter protein fadd (fas-associated–
death-domain) to fas through interactions involving death
domains in each of the proteins.45 fadd contains a death
effector domain (ded), which in turn binds to the death
effector domains of procaspase-8.50,51 the binding of fas,
fasl, fadd, and procaspase-8 results in the formation of
disc, which in turn results in dimerization and activation
of procaspase-8.53 activated caspase-8 cleaves and activates downstream procaspase-3 and bid (bh3 [b cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) homology domain 3] interacting
domain death agonist),54–56 a proapoptotic protein in the
bcl-2 family.
the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway. activation of
caspase 8 also causes cleavage of bcl-2 family of proteins
such as bid. the bcl-2 family of proteins is either proapoptotic (bax, bid, bik, bak) or antiapoptotic (bcl-2, bcl-xl).
activation of the proapoptotic bcl-2 family members
causes their translocation to the mitochondria, where they
interact with the antiapoptotic members that are components of the mitochondrial membrane.57 this interaction
depolarizes voltage-dependent mitochondrial channels and
releases mitochondrial mediators of apoptosis such as cytochrome c58 and smac/diablo. the association of cytochrome c with adapter molecule apaf-1 and capsize 9
activates capsize 3, and thus the capsize cascade.57 smac/
diablo is a mitochondrial protein that has been recently
characterized and shown to counteract the effect of caspase
inhibitors. when released, smac/diablo binds and neutralizes the inhibitors of apoptosis protein family (iaps),
thus promoting caspase activity, and apoptosis.38
in the extrinsic pathway, activation of the death receptor
stimulates the disc assembly, leading to activation of procaspase-8. activated caspase-8 then cleaves the downstream procaspase-3, resulting in proteolysis of cellular
substrates and cell death.
in the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, extracellular
and intracellular stimuli are transmitted to the mitochondria
via the bh3-only proteins (eg, bid) and bax, which then
translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane. the release of cytochrome c, smac/diablo and other apoptogens
is stimulated by bax and bak. cytochrome c, apaf-1, datp,
and procaspase-9 together form the apoptosome, leading to
the activation of procaspase-9. activated procaspase-9 leads
to activation of procaspase-3.
bid, a bh3-only protein is a direct substrate of caspase-8,
and connects the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. cleavage
of bid releases the c-terminus end of bid, which then
384 journal of cardiac failure vol. 12 no. 5 june 2006
translocates to and inserts into the outer mitochondrial
membrane, thus triggering the activation of bax and bak
and release of cytochrome c.
apoptosis assays: methods of detection
the use of electron microscopy in the detection of apo-
ptotic bodies containing nuclei with characteristic features
of apoptosis gives us the most convincing evidence of apo-
ptosis in tissue samples. however, this method of detection
is difﬁcult and labor intensive, as apoptotic bodies are
phagocytosed within hours of cell death.
the biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is the degradation
of genomic dna by endogenous dnases, which cut the in-
ternucleosomal regions into double-stranded fragments of
180 to 200 base pairs.12,13 using this feature, when cellular
dna is separated on agarose gels, a characteristic ladder-
like pattern of fragments with multiples of 200 base pairs
in length are noted. the tunel method is the most widely
used technique in the detection of apoptosis. in this method,
the dump is attached to the 30 end of genomic dna by ter-
minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and positive cells are
visualized by ﬂuorescent dyes conjugated to dutp.59 tu-
nel staining is not speciﬁc for apoptosis. it has been
shown that positive tunel staining is associated not
only with apoptotic cardiomyocytes, but also with necrotic
cardiomyocytes or even viable cardiomyocytes undergoing
dna repair.60,61 because the rate of apoptosis is generally
very low in normal hearts as well as in diseased hearts,
a high false-positive rate severely limits the interpretation
of tunel-positive cells.62 this problem was partially
avoided by the development of taq- and pfu-labeling tech-
niques that speciﬁcally identify apoptotic dna frag-
ments.63,64 by the in situ ligation assay using taq
polymerase, it is possible to detect the single base dna
overhangs in apoptotic cells.63 these dna fragments are
not found in necrotic tumor cells and after nonapoptotic
events such as treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide
or exposing them to prolonged postmortem autolysis.63
guerra et al65 reported that cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurs
in end-stage heart failure at rates 10- to 5-fold lower than
those previously reported using the tunel staining
method. thus assays using taq and pfu labeling techniques
are suggested to be very speciﬁc for detection of cardio-
myocyte apoptosis in tissue samples.
phosphatidyl serine (ps), a lipid normally restricted to
the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane, has been shown
to translocate from the internal to the external leaﬂet of
the plasma membrane in cells undergoing apoptosis.66–68
annexin-v, a phospholipid-binding protein has been shown
to speciﬁcally and reversibly bind to ps in a calcium-de-
pendent manner in apoptotic cells.69 recombinant annex-
in-v conjugated with a detectable marker such as biotin
or ﬂuorescein has been used to detect the externalization
of ps in apoptotic cells.70 the use of annexin-v in detec-
tion poses a few problems: annexin-v binding to ps is not
speciﬁc for apoptotic cells and is also seen in activated
platelets and necrotic tissues.71 further, annexin-v assays
may be less sensitive in settings characterized by low level
of apoptosis or with asynchronous death.71
each of these described methods poses limitations, mainly
in regard to their sensitivity and speciﬁcity. to avoid or mini-
mize detection errors, it has recently been suggested that
a combination of 2 or more detection techniques be used.72
apoptosis in the cardiovascular system
in the last decade, there has been increasing evidence
suggesting the importance of apoptosis in the development
and progression of cardiovascular disease. apoptosis has
been detected in the myocardium in a number of cardiac pa-
thologies including hypoxia,73 ischemia followed by reper-
fusion, myocardial infarction, myocardial hypertrophy, and,
more recently, in patients with end-stage heart failure.74,75
apoptosis has also been detected in atherosclerotic lesions
of the vasculature.76
apoptosis in the developing heart
the fully differentiated cardiomyocyte in the adult heart
has limited (if any) ability to proliferate. as such, apoptosis
is observed infrequently in adult hearts. in contrast, cardio-
myocyte apoptosis is known to play a vital role in the embryo-
genesis of the heart, such as formation of septa between
cardiac chambers and valves. this evidence suggests that
defects in apoptosis can result in congenital heart disease.
major foci of apoptosis in the developing heart include zones
of fusion of the atrioventricular or bulbar cushions, and both
aortic and pulmonary valves in noncardiomyocytes. myocyte
apoptosis also occurs in the interventricular septum and right
ventricular wall after birth, during the transition from fetal to
adult circulations. the conducting tissue also undergoes
apoptosis, and aberrant apoptosis is implicated in congenital
heart block and long qt syndrome or the persistence of
accessory pathways.
apoptosis in heart failure
heart failure is the ﬁnal clinical presentation of a variety
of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease,
hypertension, valvular heart disease, myocarditis, diabetes,
and alcohol abuse.77 in response to various pathologic
stressors and increased demands for cardiac work, the heart
adapts through compensatory hypertrophy of myocytes,78
which is characterized by an increase in the myocyte size
and the expression of contractile and other proteins nor-
mally expressed only during fetal development.79,80 these
short-term adaptive responses to maintain cardiac output ul-
timately become maladaptive.77,78 an integral part of the
pathogenesis of heart failure is loss of myocytes. tradition-
ally, myocyte loss was thought to be solely from necrosis.
however, in the last 10 years, there has been increasing ev-
idence to suggesting that apoptosis plays an important role
in myocyte death. the initial evidence came from studies
that had demonstrated apoptosis in myocardial biopsies
how do cardiomyocytes die?
obtained from patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy.74 this was later confirmed in explanted hearts from
patients with end-stage heart failure undergoing heart transplantation.74,81 apoptosis has been consistently noted in experimental models of heart failure in response to variety of
injurious stimuli such as ischemia, ischemia-reperfusion,
hypoxia, calcium excess, oxidative stress, rapid pacing,
gene induction, sustained stretching, and doxorubicin
use.73,82–88
the role of apoptosis in heart failure can be better understood by examining the clinical and experimental evidence
of apoptosis at several stages of heart failure development
(ie, initiation, progression, and end-stage heart failure).
roughly 30% of the 1 million americans who suffer
from myocardial infarction every year proceed to heart failure.89 both acute loss of myocytes in the infarcted area and
progressive remodeling in the surviving ventricle contribute
to left ventricular dysfunction. apoptosis is suggested as
a major causative agent for the loss of these myocytes. in
rodent models of myocardial infarction, the most cell death
in the initial 2 to 4 hours after coronary occlusion is due to
apoptosis.83 however, in the first 24 hours, necrosis may
play a prominent role; there is anecdotal evidence that antiapoptotic therapy may be less effective within this therapeutic window.90 ischemia associated with reperfusion,
may be a more potent stimulus for apoptotic cell death
than ischemia alone. 90 this may sound confusing, because
reperfusion is known to improve left ventricular function.
although reperfusion lowers the number of myocardial
cells undergoing apoptosis, it accelerates apoptosis in nonsalvageable cells.91 thus ischemia with reperfusion, seems
to make apoptosis even more prominent than ischemia
alone.92 oxygen-derived free radicals, alterations of intracellular calcium homeostasis, increased mechanical stretch,
and inflammatory reactions, are some of the factors associated with ischemia-reperfusion that are known to induce apoptosis in cardiac myocytes.73,83,85,93
is cardiomyocyte apoptosis a significant factor in the
transition from compensated to decompensated heart failure? evidence from animal models and human studies suggest that it does. myocyte apoptosis has been documented
in animal models of experimentally-induced left ventricular
hypertrophy and heart failure.94–96 the presence of apoptosis late after myocardial infarction has been documented in
several studies.97–99 the presence of apoptosis, late after
a myocardial infarction, correlates with worsening heart
failure, probably via a loss of functional myocardium and
increased left ventricular remodeling.9 myocyte apoptosis
in the infarct zones as well as in areas remote from the infarct site have been found to be a major determinant of adverse left ventricular remodeling in patients who died 10 to
60 days after a myocardial infarction.97,100 this has, in general, translated into unfavorable hemodynamic performance
and adverse clinical outcomes in heart failure.101 not surprisingly, occurrence of early symptomatic heart failure after myocardial infarction also correlates with degree of
apoptosis.90 what are the causes of apoptosis in the
kunapuli et al
385
transition to end-stage heart failure? apoptosis appears to
be ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion driven at the site of recent infarct and load, receptor or neurohormone dependent
at sites remote from the ischemic area.90 in addition, the
epiphenomenon associated with myocardial infarction and
early ventricular remodeling are potent inducers of apoptosis. these include myocardial stretch, myocardial wall
stress, cytokines, and neurohormones. excess norepinephrine and angiotensin ii, commonly produced as a part of peripheral neurohormonal rearrangements after an acute
myocardial infarction, have been demonstrated to enhance
apoptosis.102,103
the role of apoptosis in hypertensive cardiomyopathy
although the potential role of apoptosis has been described in different cardiac disease states, only recently
has a critical role for cardiomyocyte apoptosis been suggested in hypertensive cardiomyopathy.
increased apoptosis has been demonstrated in the hypertrophied left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats
(shr),86,95,104,105 rats with renal hypertension,106 rats
with angiotensin ii–induced hypertension,107 and dahl
salt-sensitive hypertensive rats108 compared with their normotensive control animals. further, an increased occurrence of apoptosis has been found in the heart from
failing shr as compared to nonfailing shr.86 the shr
is as genetic model of hypertension in which early hypertrophic adaptation to hypertension and subsequent transition to severe heart failure and premature death
occur.109,110 the transition from compensated hypertrophy
to heart failure in shr is accompanied by numerous structural and functional changes, including a reduction in the
relative cardiomyocyte mass.111
in humans, cardiomyocyte apoptosis has been shown to
be abnormally stimulated in the hypertrophied hearts of
patients with essential hypertension, no angiographic
evidence of coronary artery disease, and normal cardiac
function.112,113 recently gonzález et al114 documented increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in hearts from hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure when compared
with hearts from hypertensive patients with left ventricular
hypertrophy and normal cardiac function. further, they
documented an increased cardiomyocyte apoptotic index
and active caspase-3 expression in hypertensive failing
hearts when compared with hypertensive hypertrophic
hearts and normotensive hearts. in comparison, moderate
cardiomyocyte loss has been documented in long-term systemic hypertension with no clinical evidence of heart failure.115,116 gonzález et al114 demonstrated a severe loss of
cardiomyocytes in failing hearts from hypertensive patients
when compared with hearts from hypertensive patients with
left ventricular hypertrophy and normal cardiac function.
based on these findings, it was suggested that apoptosis
and cardiomyocyte loss precedes the impairment in ventricular function and its exacerbation accompanies the development of heart failure in hypertensive patients.62

autophagic cell death
normal development of cells is dependent on a tightly
regulated balance of protein synthesis and degradation, as
well as organelle-development and dismantlement. organ-
elle turnover is mainly mediated by a process known as au-
tophagy.117 autophagy is a dynamic process in which
subcellular membranes undergo dramatic morphologic
changes. the process of autophagy can be broken down
into at least 4 discrete steps: induction, formation of auto-
phagosome, autophagosome docking and fusion with the
lysosome or vacuole, and autophagic body breakdown.
induction of autophagy. autophagic degradation is
both developmentally and nutritionally regulated. nonspe-
ciﬁc autophagy is inhibited under nutrient-rich conditions
and induced by starvation.117 in mammalian cells, tor ki-
nase has been shown to play a role in the induction of au-
tophagy.118,119 in nutrient rich conditions, tor kinase exerts
a negative regulatory effect on autophagy, thus inhibiting
induction. under conditions of starvation, tor kinase is in-
activated, and the negative regulation is relieved, resulting
in induction of autophagy.117–119
formation of the autophagosome. after autophagy is
induced, a double membrane vesicle forms in the cell cytosol,
resulting in the sequestration of cytoplasmic components
destined for autophagic death. in mammalian cells, the origin
of the sequestering membrane is thought to be the endoplas-
mic reticulum.27 the sequestration of the cytoplasmic com-
ponents is tightly regulated and controlled by gtpases,
phosphatidylinositol kinases, and various phosphatases.120
increasing the levels of class iii phosphoinositide 3-kinase
product phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase in human colon
cancer cells stimulates autophagy.120 in contrast, increases in
class i phosphoinositide 3-kinase products phosphatidylino-
sitol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-
trisphosphate inhibit autophagy.120
autophagosome docking and fusion.
in this phase,
the formed autophagosome docks with the lysosome/vacu-
ole. the fusion of the autophagosome membrane with the
lysosome results in the release of its contents into the lyso-
some/vacuole. the cytoplasmic components are then de-
graded by the lysosomal proteases. this process
is
dependent on microtubules and maintenance of proper acid-
iﬁcation.117
autophagic body degradation. after the fusion of
the autophagosome with the lysosome/vacuole, the outer
membrane of
the autophagosome is degraded by the
lysosomal proteases. efﬁcient degradation is dependent on
proteinase b, luminal acidiﬁcation, and cvt 17 protein,
a candidate lipase that has been shown to degrade the auto-
phagic body.121–124
the ubiquitin-protease system
protein metabolism, pivotal for normal cellular function,
involves both synthesis and degradation of proteins on a con-
stant basis. eukaryotic cells are equipped with different sys-
tems to accomplish protein degradation: the mitochondrial
proteases, which degrade membrane and endocytosed pro-
teins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which degrades
the vast majority of long- and short-lived normal and abnor-
mal intracellular proteins.125 a total of 80% to 90% of all
intracellular proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-protea-
some system, which is hence considered to be the major
pathway of intracellular protein degradation and of the
utmost signiﬁcance for cell biology.126
protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system
involves 2 discrete and successive steps (fig. 2): tagging of
the substrate by covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin
molecules and degradation of tagged proteins by the 26s
proteasome complex with release of free and usable ubiqui-
tin. this step is mediated by the ubiquitin recycling
isopeptidases (deubiquitinating enzyme). conjugation of

the outer mitochondrial membrane thus triggering the activation of
bax and bak and release of cytochrome c.

is transferred from e2 to a substrate-specific e3. (4) formation
of a substrate-e3 complex and biosynthesis of a substrate-anchored polyubiquitin chain. (5) the polyubiquitinated substrate
binds to the ubiquitin receptor subunit in the 19s complex of
the 26s proteasome, after which the substrate is degraded into
short peptides by the 20s complex. (6) ubiquitin is recycled via
the action of the isopeptidases.
polypeptide to the protein substrate proceeds via a 3-step
cascade mechanism. in the first step, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme e1 activates ubiquitin in an atp-requiring reaction to generate a high-energy thiol ester intermediate,
e1-swubiquitin. one of the several e2 enzymes (ubiquitin
carrier proteins) transfers the activated ubiquitin from e1,
via an additional high-energy thiol ester intermediate, e2swubiquitin, to the substrate that is specifically bound to
the membrane of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family e3.
the e3 family catalyzes the last step in the conjugation process: covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate. the
ubiquitin molecule is generally transferred to an e-nh2
group of an internal lysine residue in the substrate to generate a covalent isopeptide bond. by successfully adding
activated ubiquitin moieties to the internal lysine residues
on the previously conjugated ubiquitin molecule, a polyubiquitin chain is synthesized. this chain is recognized by the
downstream 26s proteasome complex.127–131
kunapuli et al

degradation of the polyubiquinated substrates is carried
out by the 26s proteasome that does not recognize nonmodified substrates. the proteasome is a multicatalytic protease that degrades polyubiquinated proteases to short
peptides. it is composed of 2 subcomplexes: a 20s core particle that carries the catalytic activity, and a regulatory 19s
regulatory particle. the 20s core particle is a barrel-shaped
structure composed of 4 stacked rings, 2 identical outer
a rings, and 2 identical inner b rings.132–135 the eukaryotic
a and b rings are each composed of 7 distinct subunits, giving the 20s complex the general structure of a1–7 b1–7 a1–7
b1–7. the catalytic sites are localized to some of the b subunits. each extremity of the 20s barrel can be capped by
a 19s regulatory particle. one important function of the
19s regulatory particle is to recognize ubiquinated proteins
and other potential substrates for the proteasome. a second
function of the 19s regulatory particle is to open an orifice
in the a ring that will allow the entry of the substrate into
the proteolytic core. further, because the folded protein
would not be able to get through the narrow proteasomal
channel, it is assumed that the 19s particle unfolds
substrates and inserts them into the 20s core particle.132–135
the ubiquitin-proteasome system of protein turn over is a
complex and multistep mechanism. defects in any of the
steps in this pathway lead to intracellular accumulation of
proteins.
the role of autophagic cell death in
cardiomyocyte loss
autophagic cell death has been demonstrated in neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson’s and alzheimer’s
disease.136,137 the role of autophagic cell death in heart
muscle degeneration has largely remained obscure. recent
studies have demonstrated the existence of autophagic cell
death in hypertrophied, failing, and hibernating myocardium.138–141 knaapen et al139 examined the cardiac tissue
of patients in terminal stage of heart failure secondary to
ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy. they observed that
0.3% of cardiomyocytes in heart failure exhibited autophagic cell death. hein et al138 studied progression from
compensated hypertrophy to heart failure in pressure
overloaded human hearts and demonstrated that cell loss
was mainly by autophagy and oncosis, thus significantly
contributing to the progression of lv systolic dysfunction.
kostin et al140 examined myocardial tissues from explanted
hearts of 19 patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy,
and demonstrated the presence of autophagic cell death.
elsasser et al141 recently demonstrated the presence of
autophagic cell death in human hibernating myocardium.
the possible relationship between the
ubiquitin-proteasome system and
autophagic cell death
there are many lines of evidence that connect the autophagic machinery with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
388 journal of cardiac failure vol. 12 no. 5 june 2006
in cell death.142 the involvement and relationship between
autophagic cell death and the ubiquitin-proteasome system
in myocardial muscle degeneration/loss has remained rela-
tively obscure. in an effort to examine the different diag-
nostic criteria of apoptotic cell death in cardiomyocytes,
knaapen et al139 studied the hypothesis of whether tunel
labeling parallels caspase activation. the results of this
study demonstrated the presence of granular cytoplasmic
ubiquitin inclusions in cardiomyocytes dying by autophagic
cell death. granular cytoplasmic ubiquitin inclusions have
been an established marker of autophagic cell death in neu-
rons. though the ﬁndings by knaapen et al. demonstrated
existence of both autophagic cell death and ubiquitin inclu-
sions in dead myocardial cells, a deﬁnite connection was
not proposed. in vitro studies by stefanis et al143 demon-
strated that disruption of ubiquitin/proteasome system was
accompanied by accumulation of polyubiquinated proteins,
a marked increase in autophagic vacuoles, an impairment in
the lysosomal proteolysis and proteasomal function, and
occurrence of autophagic cell death. accumulation of ubiq-
uitin conjugates/inclusion bodies associated with ubiquitin/
proteasome system, and certain disease-characteristic pro-
teins, have been reported in a broad array of chronic degen-
erative diseases, such as the neuroﬁbrillary tangles of
alzheimer’s disease, brainstem lewy bodiesdthe neuro-
pathologic hallmark in parkinson’s disease, and nuclear
inclusions in cag repeat expansion (poly-glutamine)
disorders such as occurring in huntington’s disease.126
based on this, kostin et al140 hypothesized that in cardio-
myocytes,
the accumulation of polyubiquitin molecules
secondary to defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system
contribute to autophagic cell death. kostin et al40 was the
ﬁrst group to analyze the molecules involved in the ubiqui-
tin conjugation/proteasomal degradation cascade in human
myocardium and to identify the functional defects in the
ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for autophagy
that ultimately results in cardiomyocyte loss. a recent study
involving explanted hearts from 19 patients with ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated a 2.3-fold downregu-
lation of the deubiquination enzyme isopeptidase, a 1.5-fold
reduction of the ubiquitin fusion degradation system-1, and
unchanged proteasomal subunit levels and proteasomal ac-
tivity, thus resulting in massive storage of ubiquitin/protein
complexes and in autophagic cell death.140 recently, in a
study to objectify the loss of myocytes and mechanisms by
which myocytes die in hibernating myocardium, elsasser
et al141 demonstrated ubiquitin related autophagic cell
death evident ultra structurally by occurrence of autophagic
vacuoles, cellular degeneration, nuclear disassembly, and
ubiquitin-protein complexes in myocardial samples of pa-
tients with hibernating myocardium.
conclusion
increasing evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies
suggest a strong role of apoptosis in the development of
several cardiovascular diseases. apoptosis inhibition may
thus be a novel and exiting was to treat cardiovascular pa-
thology. however, a signiﬁcant number of questions regard-
ing the relative contribution of apoptosis to cardiomyocyte
death and its clinical relevance remain unclear. apoptosis is
not the only form of death leading to loss of cardiomyo-
cytes, because recent evidence suggests the potential role
of autophagy in cardiomyocyte death. further, it is entirely
unclear to what extent apoptosis contributes to the progres-
sion of heart disease. it would be important to determine
whether apoptosis is one of the early causes rather than
a terminal event that is associated with end-stage heart fail-
ure. recent evidence suggesting the role of autophagy in
cardiomyocyte cell death is exiting. further, the potential
interaction between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and
autophagic cell death in cardiomyocytes may give us a bet-
ter understanding of the molecular mechanisms of autopha-
gic cell death in the heart. the concept of autophagic cell
death resulting in cardiomyocyte loss is relatively new. fu-
ture studies, both in vitro and in vivo may shed light on the
exact role of autophagy in the cardiovascular system. im-
proved detection and measurement techniques may give
us a better understanding of the exact role of apoptosis
and autophagy in cardiomyocyte death, thus enabling the
development of therapeutic options to treat cardiovascular
pathology.
