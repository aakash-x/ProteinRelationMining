the interaction of candida albicans with macrophages is
considered a crucial step in the development of an ade-
quate immune response in systemic candidiasis. an in vitro
model of phagocytosis that includes a differential staining
procedure to discriminate between internalized and non-
internalized yeast was developed. upon optimization of a
protocol to obtain an enriched population of ingested
yeasts, a thorough genomics and proteomics analysis was
carried out on these cells. both proteins and mrna were
obtained from the same sample and analyzed in parallel.
the combination of two-dimensional page with ms re-
vealed a total of 132 differentially expressed yeast protein
species upon macrophage interaction. among these spe-
cies, 67 unique proteins were identified. this is the first time
that a proteomics approach has been used to study c.
albicans-macrophage interaction. we provide evidence of a
rapid protein response of the fungus to adapt to the new
environment inside the phagosome by changing the ex-
pression of proteins belonging to different pathways. the
clear down-regulation of the carbon-compound metabo-
lism, plus the up-regulation of lipid, fatty acid, glyoxylate,
and tricarboxylic acid cycles, indicates that yeast shifts to a
starvation mode. there is an important activation of the
degradation and detoxification protein machinery. the
complementary genomics approach led to the detection of
specific pathways related to the virulence of candida. net-
work analyses allowed us to generate a hypothetical model
of candida cell death after macrophage interaction, high-
lighting the interconnection between actin cytoskeleton,
mitochondria, and autophagy in the regulation of apoptosis.
in conclusion, the combination of genomics, proteomics,
and network analyses is a powerful strategy to better un-
derstand
interactions.

host-pathogen
the
complex
gastrointestinal tract, and vagina of many mammals and does
not normally cause disease in immunocompetent colonized
hosts. in the last 3 decades, c. albicans has increasingly be-
come the focus of medical interest because it remains the cause
of substantial morbidity and mortality in the expanding immu-
nocompromised population (i.e. aids or cancer patients) (1, 2).
at present, fatal opportunistic mycosis continues to be alarm-
ingly frequent (3, 4) as the cure rate is limited by reduced
effectiveness and serious side effects of the few currently avail-
able drugs, the appearance of antifungal drug resistance, and
the lack of accurate and prompt diagnostic procedures (5, 6).
these infections are the result of a coordinated battle be-
tween the fungus and its host. the mammalian immune sys-
tem is a powerful barrier to candida infections, and phago-
cytic cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, are a
primary line of defense against microbial infections. macro-
phages also communicate with the adaptative immune sys-
tem as antigen-presenting cells, capturing and processing
foreign antigens for presentation to t cells, enabling immuno-
logical memory (7). when a phagocyte recognizes the pres-
ence of a foreign cell, it engulfs the microorganism by a
process called phagocytosis by which its membrane forms a
phagosome (8). this phagosome is a hostile environment (low
nutrients, acidic ph, and hydrolytic enzymes) for the fungus.
although tuned host responses are critical in controlling fun-
gal infections, pathogens like candida have evolved mecha-
nisms to overcome the damage caused by the macrophage.
among the most important of these mechanisms are the
morphological transition and inhibition or neutralization of
toxic compounds (9). in this study, we suggest that the induc-
tion of different pathways leading to active self-destruction
(i.e. programmed cell death (pcd)1), originally described in
mammals, could be a yeast survival mechanism (10, 11).
the fungus candida albicans is part of the normal microbial

functional analysis of c. albicans-macrophage interaction
the ready availability of the c. albicans genome sequence
has led to genome-wide transcription analysis in c. albicans
(12–14). genome-wide mrna expression profiling by dna
microarrays has proven to be a powerful tool in characterizing
the changes in biological processes (15). different genomics
approaches to studying c. albicans response after phagocyte
interaction have been performed, showing the potential of
these strategies to analyze the host-pathogen interplay (16 –
18). nevertheless most biological functions are executed by
the proteins. as a result, proteomics-based approaches,
which examine the level of protein expression of a tissue or
cell type, complement the genome initiatives and are increas-
ingly being used to address biomedical questions. thus, pro-
teomics could substantially complement the existing molec-
ular understanding of host-pathogen interaction, giving new
insight at a higher level (19). proteomics is based on highly
efficient methods of separation and analysis of proteins in
living systems, providing exhaustive information on biochem-
ical properties such as the level of protein expression, post-
translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, etc.
a thorough proteomics analysis of the c. albicans response
upon macrophage interaction could provide a large amount of
information, such as putative new virulence factors required
for future drug discovery and vaccine development (20, 21). in
this work, we used an in vitro system of phagocytoses by
utilizing the murine macrophage cell line raw 264.7 and the
wild-type yeast strain sc5314. an exhaustive protocol of
yeast isolation after the encounter with macrophages was
developed. differential c. albicans protein expression in these
conditions was studied by two-dimensional (2d) page. dif-
ferentially expressed proteins were identified by peptide mass
fingerprinting and fragmentation using a maldi-tof/tof
mass spectrometer. in addition, the differential gene expres-
sion using microarrays was also analyzed. proteomics infor-
mation, when combined with mrna expression data, has
provided a more detailed picture of the c. albicans-macro-
phage interaction.
this integrated approach has led to the establishment of
correlations in “specific” cellular pathways that reflect a global
view of the molecular fungal phenotype in this biological con-
text. results from the network visualizing system led us to
hypothesize that candida cells could possibly trigger different
cell death pathways after macrophage contact. furthermore
this apoptotic yeast cell death is connected with mitochondria
and actin cytoskeleton.
experimental procedures
strains, media, and cell culture conditions—the c. albicans strain
used in this study was sc5314 (a clinical isolate) (22). for phagocytic
experiments, this strain was grown on solid yed medium (1% d-
glucose, 1% difco yeast extract, and 2% agar), incubated at 30 °c for
at least 2 days, and then collected and diluted to the desired cell
dilution in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated fetal bovine serum (invitrogen).
raw 264.7 ␥no⫺ murine macrophages were obtained from the
american type culture collection (manassas, va) and maintained in
complete culture medium (rpmi 1640 medium containing 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml peni-
cillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (invitrogen) at 37 °c in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% co2. cells were split after reaching the confluent
state, usually every 2–3 days. raw cells were plated at the indicated
density 18 –24 h prior to the start of the experiments (23).
phagocytosis quantification—to select the optimal conditions for
subsequent genomics and proteomics analyses, a differential staining
protocol was set up to quantify the phagocytic process. c. albicans
yeasts were prelabeled with oregon green 488 (1 ␮m) (molecular
probes). labeling was performed in the dark with gentle shaking
(30 °c) for 1 h. dye uptake and cell viability in these conditions were
confirmed by visualization of green fluorescence using a fitc filter.
cells were washed twice with pbs, 100 mm glycine and resuspended
in pbs at the desired density. raw 264.7 macrophages (5 ⫻ 105
cells/well) were allowed to ingest oregon green-labeled yeast on
sterile glass coverslips for 1.5 and 3 h using a fungus-macrophage
ratio of 1:1. cells were then washed with ice-cold pbs and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. to distinguish between internalized
and attached/non-ingested yeast, c. albicans cells were counter-
stained with calcofluor white m2r (sigma) (2.5 ␮m) for 15 min in the
dark. cwh, a fungus-specific stain, binds specifically to the yeast cell
wall chitin and does not enter into macrophages. after several
washes, coverslips were mounted with specific mounting medium
(dakocytomation denmark a/s). the number of ingested cells (con-
taining green fluorescence) and/or adhered/non-ingested (calcofluor
white blue fluorescence) were quantified by phase-contrast and flu-
orescence microscopy using a carl zeiss axioplan-2 microscope
(carl zeiss ag) with a mercury hbo/100-watt lamp fitted with fitc
(excitation/emission bp 480/30 and bp 535/40, respectively) and uv
filters (4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride excitation/
emission bp 365/12 and long pass 397, respectively) and equipped
with a digital camera, spot-2 (diagnostic instruments). metamorph
5.0 (universal imaging corp.) and imagej version 1.35h (available at
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html) softwares were used to analyze images.
three different slides were prepared for each time point, and at least
four experiments were done. no less than 600 c. albicans cells were
scored per slide, and data were expressed as the percentage of cells
internalized by macrophages. to follow the interaction between c.
albicans and macrophages (fungus-macrophage ratio, 1:1), 3-h time
course video microscopy was carried out. images were captured
every 30 s with a nikon eclipse te2000-u microscope (using contrast
phase lenses) equipped with a thermostatic plate and connected to a
high resolution hamamatsu orca-er camera. the information was
processed using aquacosmos 2.0 software.
isolation of ingested/attached yeasts after macrophage interac-
tion—on day ⫺1 (18 –24 h prior to the start of the co-culture experi-
ments), macrophages were collected and counted with a neubauer
chamber (hemocytometer). a total of 3.5 ⫻ 107 cells were plated in
complete culture medium in a 750-ml cell culture flask and grown
overnight at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere with 5% co2. c.
albicans strain sc5314 was grown overnight at 30 °c on solid yed
medium (to maintain cells in the yeast form). on day 1, these yeast
cells were harvested, washed twice with pbs, counted, and diluted to
the desired density in 50 ml of complete culture medium. a total of
5 ⫻ 107 yeast cells were added per flask to obtain a fungus-macro-
phage ratio of 1:1 (because repeated cell counts of the overnight
macrophage cultures indicated a growth rate of 1.4) and incubated for
1.5 h (for microarray experiments) and 3 h (for both proteomics and
microarray experiments) at 37 °c and 5% co2. non-ingested and
unbound candida cells were removed by washing three times with
ice-cold pbs. the macrophages plus bound/ingested yeast cells
were dislodged by scraping the flask with rubber scrapers in ice-cold

water and pooled by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm (kubota
2010, kubota corp.). the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in a
0.25% triton x-114 solution (50 mm tris-hcl, 2 mm edta, ph 7.5),
vortexed three times, and chilled on ice for 30 min to eliminate most
of the lysed macrophages. subsequently another triton x-114 treat-
ment was performed for 5 min. next the sample was washed four to
six times with ice-cold milliq water to eliminate any trace of the
detergent used. control c. albicans cells were collected, washed, and
treated in the same way as above but in the absence of macrophages.
generation of candida protein extracts for proteomics analysis—
cytoplasmic extracts were obtained according to ref. 24 with some
modifications. briefly the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1 mm edta, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm dtt,
0.5 mm pmsf, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (complete mini,
edta-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, roche diagnostics). an
equal volume of 0.4–0.6-mm-diameter glass beads was added. cells
were disrupted in a fastprep cell breaker (bio 101, inc.) for 20 s and
cooled on ice for 5 min (this procedure was repeated until at least 80%
of the cells had been lysed as determined by phase-contrast micro-
scopic examination). cell extracts were separated from glass beads and
cell debris, collected in a new tube through refrigerated centrifugation,
further clarified at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and stored at ⫺80 °c. protein
quantification was performed using the bradford assay (bio-rad).
2d page—two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as
reported previously (25) with some modifications. samples containing
100 ␮g (analytical gels) or 0.5–1 mg (preparative gels) of protein were
solubilized in a rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% chaps,
2% pharmalyte ph 3–10, 1% destreak (ge healthcare), and brom-
phenol blue (sigma)) and were then applied onto 18-cm ready made
ipg strips with non-linear ph 3–10 gradient (ge healthcare). ief was
performed using an ipgphor姞 focusing unit (ge healthcare) at 15 °c:
for analytical gels, 500 v for 1 h, 500–2000 v in 1 h, and 8000 v for 5.5 h;
for preparative gels, 30 v (active rehydration) for at least 13 h, 500 v for
1 h, 1000 v for 1 h, 2000 for 1 h, 2000–5000 v in 3 h, and 8000 v for
11 h. after this, ipg strips were reduced (2% dithioerythritol) and then
alkylated (2.5% iodoacetamide) in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 6.8, 30% glycerol, 2% sds). the second dimension sep-
aration by molecular weight was carried out on homogenous 10% t,
1.6% c (piperazine diacrylamide as a cross-linker) in polyacrylamide
gels (1.5 mm thick). electrophoresis was conducted at 40 ma/gel con-
stant current for 6 h in a protean ii gel tank (bio-rad). analytical gels
were silver-stained according to bjellqvist et al. (26) with few modifica-
tions, and preparative gels were stained using r-250 coomassie bril-
liant blue (sigma) and silver staining compatible with ms analyses (27).
analysis of differential protein expression—2d images were cap-
tured by scanning stained gels using a gs-800 imaging densitometer
(bio-rad), digitalized with multi-analyst software (bio-rad), and an-
alyzed with the image-master 2d-platinum computer software (ge
healthcare). six gels of each sample (control and treated), obtained
from three different assays, were analyzed to guarantee representa-
tive results and for future comparative studies. after automated spot
detection, spots were checked manually to eliminate any possible
artifacts such as background noise or streaks. the patterns of each
sample were overlapped and matched, using the selection of 28
common spots present in both images as landmarks, to detect po-
tential differentially expressed proteins. spot normalization, as an
internal calibration to make the data independent of experimental
variations between gels, was made using relative volumes (%vol) to
quantify and compare the gel spots; %vol corresponds to the volume
of each spot divided by the total volume of all the spots in the gel.
synthetic gels from both treated and control yeasts were obtained
from the six gels analyzed previously.
protein identification by maldi-tof ms or ms/ms—the protein
spots of interest were manually excised from preparative silver-
462 molecular & cellular proteomics 6.3
stained gels by biopsy punches, placed in an eppendorf tube, and
washed twice with double distilled water. proteins for analysis were
in-gel reduced, alkylated, and digested with bovine trypsin (12.5
ng/␮l, sequencing grade; roche applied science) according to the
procedure published by sechi and chait (28). after digestion, the
supernatant was collected, and 1 ␮l was spotted on a maldi target
plate and allowed to air dry for 10 min at room temperature. subse-
quently 0.4 ␮l of matrix (3 mg/ml of ␣-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cin-
namic acid (sigma) diluted in 0.1% tfa-acn/h2o (1:1, v/v)) were
added to the dried peptide digest spots and allowed to air dry for
another 5 min at room temperature. the samples were analyzed with
a 4700 proteomics analyzer maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometer
(applied biosystems, framingham, ma). this maldi-tof/tof instru-
ment consists of a maldi source with a 200-hz neodynium yag
(yttrium aluminium garnet) laser operating at 355 nm and operated in
positive ion reflector mode with an accelerating voltage of 20,000 v.
all ms spectra were internally calibrated using peptides from the
autodigestion of trypsin. the analysis by maldi-tof mass spectrom-
etry produced peptide mass fingerprints, and the peptides observed
can be collated and represented as a list of monoisotopic molecular
weights. for ms analyses, a monoisotopic peak is selected, and all
known contaminant ions were excluded during the process. the
parameters used to analyze the data were: a signal to noise threshold
of 20 and a resolution higher than 10,000 with a mass accuracy of 20
ppm. proteins ambiguously identified by peptide mass fingerprints
were subjected to ms/ms sequencing analyses using the 4700 pro-
teomics analyzer (applied biosystems). hence from the ms spectra,
suitable precursors were selected for ms/ms analyses with cid (at-
mospheric gas was used) in 1-kv ion reflector mode and precursor
mass windows of ⫾10 da. the plate model and default calibration
were optimized for the ms/ms spectra processing. the parameters
used to analyze the data were: a signal to noise threshold of 10 and
a resolution higher than 6000.
for the protein identification, both ms and ms/ms spectra were
automatically searched using a local
license of mascot 1.9 from
matrix science through the protein global server (gps) from applied
biosystems. the search parameters for peptide mass fingerprints and
tandem ms spectra obtained were set as follows: two sequence
databases were used, swiss-prot/trembl non-redundant protein da-
tabase (www.expasy.ch/sprot) as well as candidadb (genolist.pas-
teur.fr/candidadb) (14) and cgd (www.candidagenome.org) (12, 13).
fixed and variable modifications were considered (cys as s-carbam-
idomethyl derivative and met as oxidized methionine), allowing for
one missed cleavage site; precursor tolerance was 50 –100 ppm and
ms/ms fragment tolerance was 0.3 da; a restriction was placed on
isoelectric point (pi 3–10); and a protein mass range from 10 to 100
kda was accepted. in all protein identifications, peptide mass finger-
print, or ms/ms, the probability scores were greater than the score
fixed as significant with a p value ⬍0.05.
rna isolation, microarray hybridization, and data analysis—all
these processes were basically carried out following the protocols
described by garcia et al. (29) and eurogentec (manufacturer) with
some modifications. briefly total rna was isolated using the rneasy
midi kit (qiagen). rna concentrations were determined by measuring
absorbance at 260 nm. rna purity and integrity were assessed using
rna nano labchips in an agilent 2100b bioanalyzer (agilent tech-
nologies, palo alto, ca) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
cdna was synthesized from 20 –30 ␮g of total rna (control and
ingested yeast) by reverse transcription using the cyscribetm post-
labeling kit, incorporating cy3-dutp or cy5-dutp (ge healthcare)
into the cdna corresponding to each sample to be compared. the
amount of cdna, as well as the incorporation of cy3 and cy5 dyes
into cdna targets, was quantified on an ultrospec 3300 pro uv/
visible spectrophotometer (ge healthcare) by measuring the absorb-

with cwh, which does not enter or stain macrophages. cwh stains the cell wall of external/adhered fungal cells blue so that green cells have
an external rim of blue fluorescence. (fluorescence and phase-contrast micrographs were acquired using a 40⫻ oil objective.) b, phagocytosis

ance of each sample at 260, 550, and 660 nm, respectively. both
labeled cdna populations were combined, dried in a vacuum trap,
and used as a hybridization probe after resuspension in 55 ␮l of egt
hybridization solution (eurogentec, seraing, belgium) and 100 ␮g of
salmon sperm (invitrogen) ml⫺1. the printed microarrays including the
complete set of 6039 orfs coded by the c. albicans sc5314 genome
and 27 control genes (spotted in duplicate) used in this study were
provided by eurogentec. information about c. albicans gene annota-
tions was obtained from candidadb, mycopathpd (proteome bio-
knowledge
library, www.proteome.com/control/tools/proteome),
and cgd. slides were hybridized overnight with the labeled probe at
42 °c in a water bath. before scanning, the chips were washed and
dried following the manufacturer’s instructions.
for each condition tested, the total rna from at least two different
experiments was analyzed, and for each rna sample at least two
different hybridizations were performed. expression ratios were ob-
tained from the average of four different microarray experiments using
two biological samples and dye swapping. to allow a direct compar-
ison of the data obtained from each experiment, labeled cdna cor-
responding to rna from c. albicans upon macrophage interaction
was co-hybridized with rna isolated from control c. albicans cells.
microarrays were scanned with a genepix 4000b scanner (axon
instruments, union city, ca) at a resolution of 5 ␮m (photomultiplier
values ranging from 550 to 700 and laser power at 100%). genepix
pro 4.0 analysis software (axon instruments) was used to locate spots
in the microarray with the appropriate grid and to obtain the two
image tiff files. all images were further processed using genepix 4.0
software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. flagged spots
and spots with an average intensity minus background below the
mean of the background (considering this as the median of the local
background for each spot) for all the non-flagged spots in any of the
channels (cy3 or cy5) were not retained for further analysis. within
this group, the spots showing in one channel a value of intensity
minus background higher than 5 times the mean of the background
for all spots in the microarray for that channel were recovered. the
reproducibility of replicates in each microarray (two spots per orf)
was analyzed by creating a normal distribution log2 (ra ⫻ 1/rb)
where ra and rb are the ratios of replicated spots after background
subtraction and normalization. replicates that exceeded the average
by more than ⫾3 standard deviation were discarded. data analysis
was accomplished using the genesight 4.0 software package (bio-
discovery inc., el segundo, ca). locally weighed linear regression
(lowess) analysis was performed as a normalization method to
remove the intensity-dependent deviation in the log2 (ratio) values.
significance analysis of the results was conducted using a student’s
t test (genesight). genes with p ⬍0.05 were considered to be signif-
icantly differentially expressed with respect to the treatment condi-
tion; and genes with p values between 0.05 and 0.1 were considered
to probably be significantly differentially expressed with respect to the
treatment condition.
the microarray data described here follow the miame (minimum
information about a microarray experiment) recommendations and
have been deposited at the national center for biotechnology infor-
mation gene expression and hybridization array data repository (gene
expression omnibus (geo), www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with the fol-
lowing accession number: gse4794.
functional classification—functional categories (pathways) for c.
albicans genes/proteins were assigned using candidadb, myco-
pathpd, and cgd available from the pasteur institute, the pro-
teome bioknowledge library, and the candida genome consor-
tium and on the basis of the saccharomyces genome database
(www.yeastgenome.org/) and mips (mips.gsf.de/proj/yeast/cygd/
db/index.html) functional assignments for saccharomyces cerevi-
siae homologs (30).
the funspec (an acronym for “functional specification”) web-
based tool was used for statistical evaluation of groups of genes and
proteins with respect to existing annotations, including go terms or
parents of the go terms (31). statistical testing for enrichment of
functional categories among the set of identified proteins and genes
was based on a hypergeometric distribution model using the method
of hughes and co-workers (31). this method gives the probability (p
value) that the intersection of a given list with any given functional
category occurs by chance. a threshold cutoff p value of p ⬍0.05 was
used as a final selection criterion to highlight statistically significant,
potentially biologically interesting clusters.
visualization,

interaction net-
works—the osprey version 1.2.0 software platform was used for
visualization and manipulation of complex interaction networks (32).
this network visualization system not only represents interactions in

yeast macrophage co-culture
to set up the optimal conditions to study proteins and
genes of c. albicans differentially expressed upon macro-
phage interaction, co-culture assays were performed as de-
scribed in detail under “experimental procedures” using a
macrophage-candida ratio of 1:1. cells ingested or associ-
ated with macrophages were discriminated using differential
fluorescent labeling with oregon green and cwh (fig. 1a).
the percentage of ingested cells was determined at different
time points. as shown in fig. 1b the phagocytic percentage
increased over the time from 1 to 3 h; it was 80% at the later
time point. to monitor this process in vivo, 3-h time course
video microscopy experiments were carried out. yeast internal-
ization occurred as early as 15–20 min. after 1 h of interaction,
the fungus started to germinate in an attempt to avoid being
engulfed by the macrophage within 3 h (supplemental fig. 1).
after optimization of the phagocytic conditions, a protocol
was set up to obtain proteins and mrna samples from inter-
nalized/attached yeast cells for proteomics and genomics
analysis, respectively. a schematic protocol is shown in fig. 2.
co-cultures (candida and macrophages) were washed twice
with pbs to eliminate unbound yeast cells. macrophages
were lysed with ice-cold water. two successive treatments
with triton x-114 were carried out to eliminate the majority of
cellular debris after phase separation. cellular debris (from
lysed macrophages) were found exclusively in the aqueous
phase where c. albicans cells can be recovered in the deter-
gent phase (34) (less than 5% of macrophage contamination
was present in the yeast fraction). fungal cells were exten-
sively washed with ice-cold water to remove any trace of the
detergent. next cells were mechanically disrupted to obtain
both protein and rna extracts from the same samples. con-
trol c. albicans cells, incubated under identical experimental
conditions but in the absence of macrophages, were used to
minimize variations due to experimental conditions.
proteomics analysis
protein separation by 2d page and comparative analy-
sis—proteins from total soluble c. albicans extracts (control
and upon macrophage interaction) were separated by 2d
page. total protein extracts were prepared from three differ-
ent experiments, and two different 2d silver-stained gels from
each single preparation were analyzed with the image-master
2d-platinum computer software. synthetic gels from both
treated and control yeasts were obtained from the six gels
analyzed previously. a protein spot had to occur in at least
five of the six gels to be included in the average (synthetic) gel
(supplemental fig. 2). reproducibility of the gels from each

ished spot present in the synthetic gel from each condition for
which central
tendency (arithmetic mean) and dispersion
(mean squared deviation) of the %vol were calculated. the
synthetic gels (control and upon macrophage interaction) gen-
erated showed a total of 325 and 322 protein spots, respec-
tively. the normalized volume of each protein spot in one sam-
ple was compared with its counterpart in another sample to
determine whether the ratio indicated a statistically significant
difference occurring during the c. albicans-macrophage inter-
action. over- and underexpressed protein species exhibited a
probability associated with a student’s t test with a two-tailed
distribution of 6.5 ⫻ 10⫺17 and 3.13 ⫻ 10⫺8, respectively (sup-
plemental table i). a 2d reference map of c. albicans upon

lated like lipid and fatty acid ␤ oxidation as well as glyoxylate
and tricarboxylic acid cycles, cell wall, and actin cytoskeleton.
alternatively other metabolic proteins belonging to c-com-
pound and carbohydrate metabolism as well as mitochondrial
biogenesis were down-regulated. other important biological
processes, such as protein fate and cell rescue, relevant for
the antioxidant and detoxification cell responses, were mainly
overexpressed. moreover proteins involved in cellular trans-
port and amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms, as well as
some unclassified proteins, were found to be over- or
underexpressed.
genomics analysis
differential transcriptional analysis of c. albicans response
after 1.5- and 3-h exposure to murine macrophages was
carried out to complement proteomics. whole-genome mi-
croarrays representing almost the complete genome of c.
albicans (microarrays contained 6039 candida genes) were
used. a total of 239 genes were found to be significantly
differentially expressed (1.75-fold up- or down-regulated). of
these, 120 and 119 genes were found to be up- and down-
regulated, respectively. although 75 genes were consistently
induced at 1.5 h, 45 were induced after 3 h. in addition, 60 and
59 genes were found to be repressed after 1.5 and 3 h,
respectively (supplemental table iii and table ii). entire data-
sets of global expression profiles can be found at gene ex-
pression omnibus as described under
“experimental
procedures.”
differentially expressed genes were classified according to
the previously reported protein functional classification. an
overview of up- and down-regulated genes within the most
interesting pathways is shown in supplemental table iii. the
following functional groups were remarkably up-regulated:
lipid, fatty acid ␤ oxidation, and isoprenoid metabolism and
ion and c-compound, and amino acid transport as well as
those involved in metal ion homeostasis and dna repair. in
contrast, most of the genes related to protein fate and bio-
genesis of cellular components (cytoskeleton and mitochon-
dria) and those involved in metabolism of amino acid, nucle-
otide, c-compound, and carbohydrate were mainly down-
regulated. genes belonging to cell cycle and dna processing,
transcription, protein synthesis, stress response, oxidative
stress and detoxification, pathogenesis, biogenesis of cell
wall, cell type differentiation, and apoptosis and genes of
unknown function were up- and down-regulated full stop.
a comparative analysis of the expression profile (number of
up- and down-regulated genes) from both times analyzed,
classified according to their biological function, is shown in
supplemental fig. 3. the number of modulated genes is
greater at the earlier time point, both in the up- and down-
regulation response. only protein and cell fate, as well as
protein with binding function, exhibit a higher number of
genes after 3 h of interaction. the high number of experimen-
tally uncharacterized genes both over- and underexpressed
should be noted.
annotation and statistical significance of the functional
categories
to obtain an integral view of the yeast biological processes
affected after macrophages interaction, functional annotation
was used for both proteomics and transcriptomics data anal-
yses. due to the low number of c. albicans genes annotated
in the cgd (www.geneontology.org/go.current.annotation-
s.shtml) (50 and 15.5% of the genes/proteins examined in this
study, respectively) and the high homology of this organism
with the model yeast s. cerevisiae, we used s. cerevisiae
orthologs as the input gene/protein list for funspec analysis
(see “experimental procedures” for further details). an issue
to be taken into account is that s. cerevisiae is not a patho-
genic fungus; thus some biological functions may not be
present in the output summary of functional classes (i.e.
pathogenesis).
to interpret the data generated by the groups of related
fungal genes/proteins differentially expressed after macro-
phage interaction, we used a web-based tool called funspec,
which uses information from public databases (i.e. mips and
go). we can look in the input list of yeast genes/proteins to
determine whether they are enriched for particular attributes
(i.e. functional roles, biochemical properties, and localization)
using a well accepted statistical model. supplemental table
iv shows a summary of the statistically significant (p ⬍ 0.05)
evidence of functional enrichment in the genomics and pro-
teomics datasets.
an important fraction of the overexpressed proteins identi-
fied by 2d page-ms were found to be involved in tricarbox-
ylic acid pathway, cell rescue, defense and virulence, protein
fate, glyoxylate cycle, and actin polymerization and/or depo-
lymerization. regarding the underexpressed proteins, biolog-
ical enrichment was found for metabolism (glycolysis, glu-
coneogenesis, and fermentation) and for protein folding and
stabilization.
additionally gene transcripts that were up-regulated were
enriched for transport facilitation, metal ion homeostasis, lipid
and fatty acid metabolism, cell wall, cell-cell adhesion, and
detoxification. meanwhile gene transcripts that were down-
regulated were enriched for metabolism (c-compounds and
carbohydrates), response to stress, cell fate, and protein fold-
ing. hence by using this statistical model we were able to
reinforce the significance of the differentially expressed pro-
teins/genes on the biological functions of the cell as well as
the importance of certain pathways considerably altered in
the fungus after encountering the macrophage.

network visualization system (osprey) to extract biological
meaning and, when possible, to formulate testable hypothe-
ses from the data generated in this work. we used s. cerevi-
siae orthologs as the input gene list as was done before with
funspec (50% of the unknown genes did not present homo-
log). maps of physical and genetic interactions of induced and
repressed uncharacterized genes are shown in supplemental
fig. 4, a and b, respectively. the network generated using the
up-regulated unknown set of genes as input file shows sig-
nificant interactions with genes related to cell organization
and biogenesis (mainly associated with cell wall and nuclear
pore), dna repair and dna damage response, protein bio-
synthesis, and, surprisingly, autophagy (supplemental fig.
4a). on the other hand, when the down-regulated unknown
genes were used as the input list, interactions associated to
metabolism, cell organization and biogenesis (largely linked to
mitochondrion and actin cytoskeleton biogenesis), and trans-
port routes and other uncharacterized genes were observed
(supplemental fig. 4b). it is worth mentioning that the gene
up-regulated at 1.5 h, sge1 (crystal violet resistance protein),
interacts with sln1 that has high similarity to mammalian
bag1 gene that negatively regulates apoptosis.
interaction network analyses of cytoskeleton-,
mitochondria-, autophagy-, and apoptosis-related
genes/proteins
as described in the above genetic network analysis, we
detected some interactions between unknown genes and
genes involved in autophagy and apoptosis. reports that
connect apoptosis with actin dynamics, mitochondrial dys-
function, and autophagy have been described recently (35–
37). thus, we decided to search in our datasets for proteins/
genes belonging to these biological functions to carry out a
new interaction network analysis. a total of 32 proteins/genes,
enclosed in those functions, were detected. a significant re-
pression in genes related to the actin cytoskeleton and mito-
chondria was noted, pointing toward a potential reduction in
actin and mitochondrial dynamics. only three proteins of 22
proteins/genes that belong to the above functional groups
were overexpressed. concerning the apoptosis-related
genes, induction of four genes and repression of two genes
were observed. finally two differentially regulated autophagic
genes were observed. more detailed information about these
data can be found in the hierarchical cluster illustrated in fig.
5a. an interaction network analysis revealed a highly complex
regulatory map in which all these proteins/genes are deeply
interconnected (supplemental fig. 5, a, b, c, and d), high-
lighting the relevant role of these categories in the dynamics
of the fungal response and cell death upon macrophage
interaction.
discussion
the innate response and the initial handling of the pathogen
by macrophages have been demonstrated to play a central
472 molecular & cellular proteomics 6.3
role in the resolution of candidiasis in a murine model of
disseminated candidiasis (38 – 40). a proteomics analysis of
the response of c. albicans after encountering macrophages
has been carried out for the first time in this work. an accurate
protocol to obtain an enriched-ingested yeast sample after
this interaction has been established. moreover the require-
ments for future proteomics studies were fulfilled with this
protocol because only candida proteins, but not macrophage
ones, were identified by ms. to complement the proteomics
study, a genomics approach to analyze the differential tran-
scriptional response of c. albicans was used. because the
temporal relationship between transcription and translation
on a large scale is not well defined, we chose to analyze not
only mrna samples corresponding to the 3-h time point used
for the proteomics analyses but also a preceding time point
(1.5 h). although previous works afforded transcriptional pro-
filing under similar conditions (16, 17), the key benefit of our
approach was to obtain both fungal protein and rna extracts
from the same cultures. in this situation, we combined the
complementary data from gene- and protein-based assays,
thus providing more information about the response of can-
dida upon macrophage interaction. the ability to conduct
these correlation analyses represents an additional and novel
means to generate discrete and testable biological hypothe-
ses from these global and discovery-driven measurements
(41– 45).
proteomics studies enabled us to describe a total of 132
statistically differentially expressed protein species. of these, 74
over- and underexpressed protein species were identified by
ms, corresponding to 67 unique proteins (fig. 4 and table i)
classified according to their biological function. some of these
differentially expressed proteins are present in a 2d reference
hyphal map and are also recognized by serum from mice and
patients with disseminated candidiasis, highlighting the impor-
tance of these proteins in the virulence of candida (25, 46–49).
it should be noted that certain proteins could not be repre-
sented due to a range of 2d page technical limitations (i.e.
molecular weight and proteins either too acidic, too basic, or too
hydrophobic) and also due to the relative abundance of proteins
(50, 51). to overcome these restrictions, more sensitive tech-
niques such as 2d dige (52, 53) or non-gel proteomics could be
used. due to technical limitations of generating large proteome
datasets, only a limited number of studies comparing differential
gene and protein expression have been performed; a major
obstacle is a lack of scalable database systems and computa-
tional tools (54). integrating the information from selected path-
ways has provided us with a global view of the yeast response.
thus, a close correlation between genomics and proteomics
datasets may indicate that genes for certain specific biological
processes may require better transcriptional and translational
synchronization for synergistic purposes and that the response
may be more specific. the most relevant pathways related to
this hostile environment are discussed below (tables i and ii
and supplemental table iii).

fig. 5. a, hierarchical clustering of selected c. albicans protein/gene expression profiles after macrophage interaction (1.5-fold up- or
down-regulated). this visualization shows records in a dendrogram (a tree graph) based on the similarity between them. the clustering method
used was unweighted pair group method with arithmetric mean (upgma) (unweighted average), and the similarity measure was done based
on the euclidean distance. each column represents interaction times (1.5 and 3 h), and each row represents the expression ratios (log2) for a
particular gene upon macrophage contact. clustering was obtained by using the software spotfire decisionsite. red represents expression
ratios higher than 1, and green indicates ratios lower than 1. the degree of color saturation represents the amount of the expression ratio as
indicated by the scale bar. gray denotes missing values. asterisks indicate genes differentially expressed after macrophage interaction with a
ratio between 1.35- and 1.5-fold up- or down-regulated, and underlined genes represent rt-pcr values (data not shown). b, hypothetical

cerevisiae knowledge are shown here. genes marked in black correspond to c. albicans, and genes in green/blue correspond to s.
cerevisiae/human orthologs, respectively. blue boxes and arrows point out those pathways detected in mammals, whereas those in black
indicate pathways detected in s. cerevisiae. dotted arrows indicate hypothetical
interrelations (for further details see the text). pka,
camp-dependent protein kinase.
metabolism and energy—the metabolic changes detected
in c. albicans protein/gene expression levels belonging to
different functional groups reflect how the yeast cells sense
this hostile environment. as described previously by other
genomics studies, the glyoxylate cycle enables microorga-
nisms to grow on acetate or fatty acids as the sole carbon
sources, reflecting the important adaptation of pathogenic
microorganisms such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and c.
albicans (16, 55). microorganisms that are able to achieve this
cycle can produce energy and grow in lipid-rich environments
such as host cells. a similar biological response was detected
here using a proteomics strategy. proteins belonging to the
glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles were overexpressed
indicating a dynamic yeast response to nutrient starvation
inside the phagosome (56). the c. albicans proteomic re-
sponse showed a clear down-regulation in the glycolytic
route, indicating that the yeast surroundings are deficient in
glucose. moreover other up-regulated proteins may reflect an
increase in the lipid and fatty acid ␤ oxidation metabolism.
these results are in agreement with previous reports that have
suggested that various lipids are released during the candida-
macrophage interaction (57, 58). similar results were exhib-
ited in our genomics study as well as by studies of candida-
phagocytes interaction using genomics approaches (16, 18).
protein fate—from the proteomics results we can see a
general overexpression of the proteins belonging to this path-
way. the yeast proteasome is a multicatalytic/multifunctional
proteinase complex necessary for the degradation of short
lived, misfolded, ubiquitinated, and oxidized proteins (59, 60).
thus, the possible existence of non-functional/toxic proteins
that the fungus needs to eliminate for its own survival could
explain the greatly increased expression of the proteasomal
proteins. this biological situation may be similar to other
biochemical and physiological stimuli, such as perturbation in
calcium homeostasis, redox status, or sugar/glucose depri-
vation that can disrupt endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis,
molecular & cellular proteomics 6.3
473
functional analysis of c. albicans-macrophage interaction
impose stress to the endoplasmic reticulum, and subse-
quently lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded pro-
teins (61). together with the induction of these systems, an
important number of folding proteins were also up-regulated.
on the other hand, genomics reflects a different situation. the
vast majority of the genes related to protein folding and sta-
bilization, protein targeting, sorting, modification, and degra-
dation as well as assembly of protein complexes were re-
pressed at both time points. this discrepancy in the
expression of genes/proteins belonging to this particular
pathway may be explained due to a very early yeast transcript
response and high stability of these proteins, taking into ac-
count their function stabilizing other proteins and their impor-
tance for the cell viability. these latter hypotheses also rein-
force the utility of both genomics and proteomics approaches
to discern a more complete biological sense of these exper-
imental results.
cellular transport—proteomics studies reflect a combined
response of over- and underexpressed mitochondrial trans-
porters. the role of por1p in apoptosis will be discussed later
on. genes corresponding to this nutrient acquisition pathway
were found to be predominantly induced; briefly amino acid
permeases (62), lipid transporters, and ion and oxygen trans-
porters as well as permeases for carbon compounds (63)
were found to be up-regulated. few genes belonging to these
permeases were found to be repressed, possibly reflecting a
strict regulatory specialization, thus permitting the cell to re-
spond to different biological conditions.
cell rescue, defense, and virulence—as deduced from
genomics and proteomics results, this pathway showed an
upward tendency, indicating its important role in the yeast
response after macrophage interaction. different functional
groups, such as oxidative stress and detoxification, dna
damage repair, and pathogenesis are included in this path-
way. reactive oxygen intermediates (roi) and reactive nitro-
gen intermediates (rni), generated by professional phago-
cytes as part of the antimicrobial burst, are thought to play a
critical role in resistance to mucosal and systemic candidiasis
(64, 65). nevertheless microorganisms can sometimes over-
come the production of roi and rni and avoid being killed by
suppressing production of roi and rni (9, 66). the strategies
used by c. albicans for the evasion of roi and rni are similar
to those described for other microorganisms; they include
enzymatic detoxification of reactive species, scavenging of
species to remove them,
iron sequestration, stress re-
sponses, and damage repair (67– 69).
from our proteomics data sheet, several proteins that play
an important role as antioxidants and detoxifying enzymes
were identified. in contrast, c. albicans genes with antioxidant
functions were found to be mostly down-regulated at 1.5 h.
these different transcriptional responses may depend on the
levels of the reactive species (70). in addition, the detoxifica-
tion machinery of candida is up-regulated at both time points
but predominantly at the earlier time point, indicating the
474 molecular & cellular proteomics 6.3
attempt of the yeast to neutralize and repair the oxidative
damage caused by the reactive oxygen species of
the
macrophage.
other important functional groups were only detected by
our genomics approach. among them, several genes related
to dna repair mechanisms were highly induced, predomi-
nantly at the earlier time point. a notable induction of genes
belonging to pathogenesis was also appreciable at both time
points.
biogenesis of the cell wall and fungal cell type differen-
tiation—the yeast-to-hypha transition, hypha-associated fac-
tors, cell wall proteins, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(gpi)-anchored proteins, and hydrolytic enzymes have been
described as factors involved in host-pathogen interactions
(i.e. full morphogenesis, virulence, survival, and resistance to
macrophages) (71–74). during this interaction, the yeast pop-
ulation has switched to hyphal forms at 1.5 h, increasing in
amount over time. a number of genes known to be hypha-
associated genes were found to be up-regulated as were a
large number of genes associated with cell wall biogenesis
and involved in virulence and invasive growth. nevertheless in
this hostile environment, the yeast could somehow be dam-
aged by macrophages and could in some way arrest its
growth and inhibit the filamentous formation as well as impair
its survival and reduce its virulence as can be deduced by the
repression of some genes belonging to fungal cell type differ-
entiation and cell wall biogenesis.
metal ion homeostasis—the regulation of metal homeo-
stasis, such as iron, may be of great importance to the
ability of the microorganism to deal with oxidative stress
because hydrogen peroxide can break down to form the
highly reactive hydroxyl radical in the presence of a transi-
tion metal catalyst (69). moreover iron acquisition is recog-
nized to be a fundamental step in the infection process by
pathogens because this essential nutrient is tightly seques-
tered by high affinity iron-binding proteins and, therefore,
not readily available in mammalian hosts (75, 76). c. albi-
cans is no exception and has evolved different mechanisms
(secreted siderophores and/or high affinity uptake systems)
to acquire iron from the host tissues (77, 78). two homolo-
gous transmembrane ferric reductases were found to be
chiefly induced at 1.5 h of interaction. in addition, the ele-
vated expression of the copper homeostasis gene slf1 is in
agreement with the recent finding of the requirement of
copper for high affinity iron import (79).
experimentally uncharacterized genes—the largest cate-
gory of modulated genes corresponds to those without
known homology that might play an important role in vivo and
would be modulated (induced or repressed) under conditions
relevant to pathogenesis. the genomics results showed a
significant representation of unknown genes, 28% (67 of 239
genes), the majority of which are, at present, unique to c.
albicans. a detailed study of these genes will be very inter-
esting due to their possible role in candida pathogenesis.
functional analysis of c. albicans-macrophage interaction
network analysis of unknown genes with s. cerevisiae or-
thologs (50%) revealed functional relationships between and
within important regulatory modules (supplemental fig. 4, a
and b).
interconnection between actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria,
autophagy, and apoptosis in candida during phagocytosis—
after a thorough network analysis, our observations suggest
the occurrence of several mechanisms that could lead to
programmed cell death in candida after phagocytosis (sup-
plemental fig. 5a). we speculate that candida cells could
activate different cell death pathways after macrophage
contact, similar to other external stimuli (nutrient limitation,
heat, oxygen peroxide, and drug treatment among others).
to establish this hypothesis, different proteins/genes impli-
cated in pcd will be discussed using as reference the model
yeast s. cerevisiae as well as the mammalian system. on
this basis, we propose a hypothetical model of yeast cell
death after macrophage interaction, summarized in fig. 5b.
interactions between mitochondria and the actin cytoskel-
eton in budding yeast are critical for normal mitochondrial
morphology, respiratory activity, motility, and inheritance
(36). we observed a significant repression in genes related
to the actin cytoskeleton and mitochondrial function, indi-
cating a potential reduction in actin dynamics and altered
mitochondrial gene/protein turnover (supplemental fig. 5, b
and c). two s. cerevisiae actin-regulatory genes, sla1 and
end3, closely interact with most of the actin-related genes
detected in this study. a recent report indicates that cells
expressing a mutated form of sla1p or lacking end3p dis-
play markers of apoptosis, suggesting the relevant role of
these interactions in the possible induction of apoptosis
(80). additionally overexpression of cofilin 1 (cof1p) in the
context of reduced actin dynamics may have an important
function during the initiation phase of apoptosis as de-
scribed in mammals (81). the actin network diagram (sup-
plemental fig. 5b) shows interconnection between cofilin 1
and adenylate cyclase (cyr1), which participates in the
ras-camp signaling pathway. in yeast, this pathway plays a
role in resistance to nutrient limitations and promotes cell
aging (82, 83). in this work, two components of this pathway
were detected as differentially expressed: fgr38 (putative
ortholog of cyr1) was up-regulated, whereas pde1 (low
affinity cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase) was re-
pressed. this suggests that a constitutive activation of the
ras-camp pathway may exist, leading to elevated camp
levels inside the fungus, and that this accumulation may
accelerate candida cell death (84). moreover various direct
and indirect physical
interactions observed in the genetic
map between camp signaling and actin-related genes hint
at a substantial
link between both functional groups and
may control candida apoptosis as described in s. cerevisiae
(85). surprisingly and in relation to the findings mentioned
above, we observed overexpression of the yeast voltage-
dependent anion-selective channel (por1p); this protein has
been described as an inducer of apoptotic cell death (86).
on the basis of all this evidence, we highlight the relevant
link between actin cytoskeleton-mitochondria and apopto-
sis because a reduction in actin dynamics can lead to
reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (⌬␺m) and to an
open state of the mitochondrial membrane pore (por1p),
allowing the release of apoptogenic proteins from the mito-
chondria (35).
at
time
points,
early
proapoptotic
in regard to apoptotic signals, differences over time were
detected, reflecting the importance of selecting several time
points.
genes
(ipf12606.3eoc, lcb1, and ipf12676) were induced with the
exception of the metacaspase mca1. the antiapoptotic gene
bir1 (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis) was induced,
whereas cap1 (key transcriptional regulator in the oxygen
stress response and aging) was repressed (fig. 5, a and b).
this apparent contradictory result can be explained by bir1p,
a substrate for nma111p (s. cerevisiae ortholog for
ipf12606.3eoc): the antiapoptotic effect of bir1p is antago-
nized by overexpression of nma111p (87). in addition, repres-
sion of cap1 plus the induction of lcb1, whose human
ortholog is said to control de novo ceramide synthesis trig-
gering apoptosis (88), may suggest a proapoptotic process. in
contrast, also at early time points, down-regulation of the
yeast mca1, involved in the initiation of apoptosis, reflects a
negative regulation of pcd (89). in conclusion, a dual yeast
behavior (pro- and antiapoptotic signals) can be detected at
1.5 h, whereas at the later time only proapoptotic signals are
identified, reflecting the aggressive environment that sur-
rounds them.
lastly induction of autophagic cell death and a co-regula-
tion of autophagy and apoptosis may be suggested by induc-
tion of uth1 (s. cerevisiae ortholog for sun42) and beclin 1
(becn1, human ortholog for vps30), indicating a high degree
of flexibility in the response of a cell to changes in environ-
mental conditions (37, 90, 91) (supplemental fig. 5d). in con-
clusion, all the proteomics data combined with the genomics
information described in this work reflect the biological situ-
ation of the fungus inside macrophages, which depends on
the expression of a specific group of protein/genes, which in
turn triggers the adaptation to this environment.
these results provide evidence of the importance of certain
fungal pathways: metabolism and energy, protein fate, cellular
transport, cell rescue, defense and virulence, biogenesis of
the cell wall and fungal cell type differentiation, metal home-
ostasis, and uncharacterized genes/proteins. network analy-
ses have led us to suggest a hypothetical model of candida
cell death after macrophage interaction. although further
studies are needed to reveal the mechanistic basis of cell
death decisions in this organism after macrophage contact,
the specific role of actin and mitochondria interactions in the
possible activation of different cell death pathways in candida
during phagocytosis are currently under investigation.
