yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) atg6/vps30 is required for autophagy and the sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, such as
carboxypeptidase y. in higher eukaryotes, however, roles for atg6/vps30 homologs in vesicle sorting have remained obscure.
here, we show that atatg6, an arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of yeast atg6/vps30, restored both autophagy and
vacuolar sorting of carboxypeptidase y in a yeast atg6/vps30 mutant. in arabidopsis cells, green ﬂuorescent protein-atatg6
protein localized to punctate structures and colocalized with atatg8, a marker protein of the preautophagosomal structure.
disruption of atatg6 by t-dna insertion resulted in male sterility that was conﬁrmed by reciprocal crossing experiments.
microscopic analyses of atatg6 heterozygous plants (atatg6/atatg6) crossed with the quartet mutant revealed that atatg6-
deﬁcient pollen developed normally, but did not germinate. because other atatg mutants are fertile, atatg6 likely mediates
pollen germination in a manner independent of autophagy. we propose that arabidopsis atg6/vps30 functions not only in
autophagy, but also plays a pivotal role in pollen germination.
autophagy is a bulk degradation mechanism by
which cytoplasmic constituents are delivered to lytic
compartments for degradation and recycling (klionsky
and ohsumi, 1999; ohsumi, 2001; levine and klionsky,
2004). the process involves sequestration of the cyto-
plasm into double-membrane vesicles called auto-
phagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes
or vacuoles. genetic studies in yeast (saccharomyces
cerevisiae) have identiﬁed a set of atg (autophagy)
genes involved in this process (klionsky and ohsumi,
1999; ohsumi, 2001). various atg proteins reside on the
preautophagosomal structure (pas) from which auto-
phagosomes originate (suzuki et al., 2001). the molec-
ular mechanisms underlying the
formation of
autophagosomes, however, have not yet been fully
elucidated.
most of the yeast atg proteins are speciﬁcally en-
gaged in autophagy and/or the cytoplasm-to-vacuole
targeting pathway, which is mechanistically similar to
autophagy (klionsky and ohsumi, 1999; levine and
klionsky, 2004). by contrast, atg6 is allelic to the pre-
viously characterized vps30 (vacuolar protein sorting),
which is required for the vacuolar sorting of car-
boxypeptidase y (cpy; seaman et al., 1997; kametaka
et al., 1998). atg6/vps30 is conserved in higher eukary-

otes and its ortholog (beclin 1) can restore autophagy
in atg6/vps30-deﬁcient yeast (liang et al., 1999;
mele´ndez et al., 2003; liu et al., 2005). suppression of
beclin 1 homologs blocked autophagy and disturbed
various biological processes (mele´ndez et al., 2003; yu
et al., 2004; liu et al., 2005). on the other hand, the
putative role of beclin 1 in membrane trafﬁcking is
controversial (zeng et al., 2006).
many atg proteins are conserved in plants, and
reverse genetic studies have demonstrated that arabi-
dopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) atg mutants are hypersen-
sitive to nutrient starvation, as well as that atg plants
exhibit accelerated senescence even under favorable
growth conditions (for review, see thompson and
vierstra, 2005; bassham et al., 2006). here, we are
interested in atatg6, an arabidopsis homolog of
yeast atg6/vps30, because it is a unique autophagy
gene that also participates in trafﬁcking events in
yeast. we ﬁrst
investigated whether atatg6 was
involved in autophagy and found that atatg6 re-
stored autophagy in atg6/vps30 yeast and that
it
localized in plant cells to a punctate structure contain-
ing arabidopsis atg8, a marker protein of the pas
(suzuki et al., 2001). we also show that arabidopsis
atg6/vps30 partially complemented vps function in
atg6/vps30 mutant yeast. several other arabidopsis
vps homologs are required in pollen tubes (hicks
et al., 2004; lobstein et al., 2004) because the polarized
growth of pollen tubes requires membrane trafﬁck-
ing (hepler et al., 2001; monteiro et al., 2005). we
found that disruption of atatg6/vps30 resulted in
male sterility because the mutant pollen did not ger-
minate. by contrast, all previously characterized atatg
mutants are fertile. our results support the idea that
atg6/vps30 in plants has distinct functions in addi-
tion to autophagy: vesicle trafﬁcking and pollen ger-
mination.

arabidopsis atg6 restores autophagy and vacuolar
protein sorting in atg6/vps30 mutant yeast
to ﬁrst investigate roles of atg6/vps30 in higher
plants, we isolated a putative arabidopsis homolog
of atg6/vps30 (atatg6) encoded by a single gene
(at3g61710) in the arabidopsis genome. atatg6-
encoded protein shares 24% amino acid identity with
yeast atg6/vps30 (seaman et al., 1997; kametaka
et al., 1998) and 31% identity with human beclin
1 (liang et al., 1999). animal homologs of atg6/
vps30 (beclin 1) restored autophagy, but not cpy
sorting, in atg6/vps30 mutant yeast (liang et al., 1999;
mele´ndez et al., 2003). to test whether atatg6 is a
functional homolog of atg6/vps30, we investigated
whether atatg6 rescues defects of yeast atg6/vps30
in autophagy and the vps pathway. atatg6 cdna
containing the entire open reading frame (orf) was
fused with the yeast atg6/vps30 promoter in a low-
copy-number plasmid (prs416) and expressed in atg6/
vps30-deﬁcient yeast (parental strain by4741). wild-
type yeast cells accumulated numerous autophagic
bodies within vacuoles after 5 h of nutrient starvation,
whereas no such vesicles were found in the vacuoles of
atg6/vps30 yeast cells (fig. 1a). under these conditions,
expression of atatg6 allowed atg6/vps30 cells to accu-
mulate autophagic bodies, albeit to a lesser extent than
did wild-type cells (fig. 1a).
we next measured the amount of intracellular and
extracellular cpy protein to determine whether cpy
was delivered into vacuoles or secreted. wild-type or
atg6/vps30 cells transformed with atg6/vps30 seemed
to properly sort cpy into vacuoles, where cpy was
processed to its mature form of 61 kd (fig. 1b, mcpy).
in atg6/vps30 cells, on the other hand, mis-sorted cpy
was secreted (fig. 1b, pcpy) and concomitantly lower
quantities of mature cpy were detected in the intracel-
lular fraction (fig. 1b, mcpy). in atatg6-transformed
atg6/vps30 cells, secretion of cpy was suppressed,
suggesting that atatg6 restores vacuolar sorting of
cpy in atg6/vps30-disrupted yeast.
atatg6 colocalizes with atatg8 at a punctate structure
in yeast cells, green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp)-
tagged atg6/vps30, like other atg proteins, partially
localizes to the punctate structure called the pas
(obara et al., 2006). to visualize atatg6 protein in
plant cells, a gfp-atatg6 fusion protein was ex-
pressed in arabidopsis protoplasts under the control
of the cauliﬂower mosaic virus 35s promoter. as
shown in figure 2a, the ﬂuorescent signal from gfp-
atatg6 was distributed in the cytoplasm and to a
single or a few bright dots. similar dot signals were
observed when atatg6 was fused to the n terminus of
gfp (atatg6-gfp; data not shown). such punctation
was not found in cells transformed with the empty
vector (35s-gfp alone; fig. 2a; see also supplemental
fig. s1b).

the arabidopsis atg6/vps30 (atatg6) gene was cloned in the low-
copy-number plasmid prs416 and expressed in atg6/vps30 yeast cells.
yeast atg6/vps30 (scatg6) and the empty vector (prs416) were used
as controls. a, cells grown to mid-log stage were collected, washed,
and subsequently incubated for another 5 h in nutrient-free medium
in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. autophagic
bodies accumulated within vacuoles (arrows). b, intracellular or extra-
cellular extracts were prepared from wild-type or atg6/vps30 cells that
were transformed with the empty vector (2), yeast (sc), or arabidopsis
(at) atg6/vps30. secreted cpy (pcpy) in the extracellular extracts and
vacuolar-targeted cpy (mcpy) or alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) in the
intracellular extracts were detected by immunoblotting.
we next attempted to determine the organelle to
which atatg6 localized. punctate localization of gfp-
atatg6 was not inﬂuenced by brefeldin a (bfa; fig.
2b). venus-tagged syp31, syp41, and syp81 served as
marker proteins for the golgi, trans-golgi network
(tgn), and endoplasmic reticulum (er), respectively
(uemura et al., 2004), and each of these marker pro-
teins showed intracellular distribution patterns that
were clearly distinguished from that of atatg6 (fig. 2,

b and c; data not shown). bright dots of cyan ﬂuores-
cent protein (cfp)-atatg6 also did not overlap with
any of these organelle markers (fig. 2c; data not shown).
in contrast, the pas marker protein, gfp-atatg8,
exhibited a punctate localization proﬁle similar to
that of gfp-atatg6 (fig. 2a; see also supplemen-
tal fig. s1). we then compared the localization of
cfp-atatg6 with that of yellow ﬂuorescent protein
(yfp)-atatg8. each fusion protein again exhibited
clear enrichment in the punctate structure within the
cytoplasm, and the coincidence of cfp and yfp sig-
nals on the bright dots (fig. 2d, arrows; supplemental
fig. s2) suggested the colocalization of atatg6 with
atatg8 in plant cells, similar to that shown in yeast
cells (obara et al., 2006).
deletion of atatg6 causes a male
gametophytic mutation
to evaluate the functions of atatg6 in planta,
we employed a reverse genetic approach. our initial
attempts to screen arabidopsis mutants (two inde-
pendent lines, salk_051168 and salk_109281) har-
boring t-dna insertions within the atatg6 gene
identiﬁed no homozygous mutant lines. atatg6 het-
erozygous plants exhibited reduced atatg6 mrna
levels relative to wild-type plants (supplemental fig.
s3), but appeared normal in appearance. each atatg6
heterozygous plant showed approximately a 1:1 seg-
regation ratio for transmission of the t-dna in the
ﬁrst selﬁng progeny (table i). a mendelian transmis-
sion ratio of 3:1 was rejected by a x2 test (p 5 7.4 3 10225;
p 5 3.6 3 10217). embryos produced by selﬁng of
atatg6/atatg6 plants grew normally and no aborted
seeds were found in the siliques. therefore, failures
of transmission of t-dna to the progeny seemed
to be due to defects in the gametes, not embryonic
lethality. next, we performed crossing experiments to
determine the gametophytes that were affected by
atg6. when atatg6 heterozygous plants (background
columbia; the line salk_051168 was used in the
following experiments) were used as pollinators of
wild-type plants (wassilewskija [ws] was used to
make it possible to conﬁrm crossing by pcr), no
t-dna-inserted progeny were obtained (table i). this
suggested the failure of transmission of atg6 through
the male gametophyte, which was statistically sup-
ported by a x2 test (p 5 9.2 3 1029). in contrast,
pollination of atatg6 heterozygous stigmas with
wild-type pollen yielded progeny with a 1:1 segrega-
tion ratio of transmission of t-dna (table i). the
observed ratio was nearly identical to the expected
t-dna transmission ratio of 1:1 through the female
gametophyte (x2 5 0.44; p 5 0.51). deletion of atatg6,
therefore, appeared speciﬁcally to inﬂuence male ga-
metophytes but not to compromise the function of
female reproductive structures.

sion efﬁciency (te; the number of t-dna-containing progeny/total
number of seedlings 3 100) was calculated. the x2 value is shown for
the predicted ratio of 3:1 (self-crosses) or 1:1 (reciprocal crosses).

dual functions of arabidopsis atg6/vps30
pollen germination. the qrt mutation yielded four
microspores derived from a single pollen mother cell
that stay attached to one another for the duration of
pollen development, which makes it easy to perform
tetrad analyses (preuss et al., 1994; mccormick, 2004).
we expected that if atatg6 were essential for pollen
germination, at most
two pollen grains in each
atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt tetrad would germinate. this
prediction was correct; only one or two pollen grains
germinated from each atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt tetrad,
whereas up to four pollen grains germinated from
each wild-type (atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt) tetrad (fig.
3, b and c). apparently, there were no severe defects in
the elongation of germinated pollen tubes of atatg6/
atatg6/qrt/qrt tetrads (fig. 3b; data not shown), pos-
sibly because only the pollen-carrying wild-type
atatg6 could germinate. these results strongly sug-
gested that atatg6 mutant pollen fails to germinate.
despite the defects in pollen germination, transmis-
sion electron microscopy and environmental scanning
electron microscopy (esem) showed that all four pollen
grains in an atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt tetrad were normal
in appearance and indistinguishable from one another
(fig. 4). each mutant pollen grain contains three normal
nuclei: one vegetative and two sperm nuclei (fig. 4f).
we also stained pollen with aniline blue to investigate
whether disorganization of cell wall composition (e.g.
callose) was associated with failures of pollen germi-
nation (johnson and mccormick, 2001). each pollen
grain of an atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt tetrad, even if not
germinated, was able to perform local outgrowth of the
pollen wall or polarized deposition of callose in a
manner similar to that of atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt
pollen (fig. 4, g and h). it was therefore likely that
the polarity of the pollen germination site was deter-
mined normally in atatg6 pollen. taken together, these
results suggested that atatg6 is not essential for male
meiosis or pollen development prior to germination.
expression of atg6 in arabidopsis
we previously showed that the atatg4 and atatg8
genes were ubiquitously expressed in whole plants
(yoshimoto et al., 2004). similarly, reverse transcrip-
tion (rt)-pcr revealed that atatg6 mrna was ex-
pressed in all organs tested (fig. 5a). expression of
atatg6 mrna was not up-regulated during ﬂoral
development (fig. 5b). likewise, pok/atvps52, an-
other arabidopsis vps homolog implicated in pollen
tube elongation (lobstein et al., 2004), was expressed in
different tissues and continuously expressed through-
out pollen development (lobstein et al., 2004; fig. 5b).
these results suggest the occurrence of autophagy and
vesicle trafﬁcking in various tissues.
discussion
we have identiﬁed atatg6 as a functional homolog
of yeast atg6/vps30 and characterized its function in

gotes. a, in vitro pollen germination of the atatg6/atatg6 heterozy-

the means of three different experiments (6sd).
pollen lacking atatg6 does not germinate
to determine the biological basis of the male game-
tophytic mutant phenotype of atatg6, we performed
microscopic analysis of atatg6 pollen. pollen grains
from atatg6 heterozygous ﬂowers were indistinguish-
able from wild-type pollen in shape and size (data not
shown). however, the efﬁciency of the in vitro pollen
germination of atatg6 heterozygous ﬂowers (39.8 6
1.4% of pollen grains germinated; n 5 977) was lower
than that of wild-type controls (76.7 6 2.5%; n 5 1,715;
for each genotype, ses for three independent experi-
ments are shown; fig. 3a). under these conditions,
pollen from other atatg mutants (atatg4a4b-1 and atatg2
were tested) germinated with efﬁciency similar to that
of wild-type controls (data not shown).

atatg6 plants to further address the role of atatg6 in

tetrads from atatg6/atatg6/qrt/qrt
plant cells how atatg6 regulates vesicular trafﬁcking,
we found that atatg6-deleted plants displayed a male
gametophytic mutant phenotype, which was similarly
exempliﬁed by another atvps mutant (see below). in con-
trast, none of the previously characterized atatg mu-
tants has exhibited male gametophytic defects. taken
together, our results raise the possibility that arabidop-
sis atg6/vps30 may be involved in other biological
pathways (e.g. vesicle trafﬁcking) in addition to au-
tophagy.
in arabidopsis cells, gfp-atatg6 proteins were
predominantly distributed throughout the cytoplasm
in accordance with biochemical studies identifying
cytosolic atg6/vps30 in yeast cells (seaman et al.,
1997; kihara et al., 2001a). in addition, recent micro-
scopic observations revealed that atg6/vps30 is par-
tially targeted to the punctate structure upon which
the pas marker protein atg8 resides (obara et al., 2006).
as expected, cfp-atatg6 colocalized with yfp-atatg8
at the dot-like structures, which were reminiscent of
the pas. by contrast, in whole plants, gfp-atatg8
localizes to many dot structures in each cell, some of
which may represent autophagosomes (yoshimoto et al.,
2004). the appearance of autophagosomes might de-
pend on cell type: an isolated cell, such as a yeast cell,
contains only a few autophagosomes and atg8 pre-
dominantly localizes at a single dot (pas) rather than
to autophagosomes (suzuki et al., 2001), mimicking
the punctate localization of atatg proteins in arabi-
dopsis suspension cells.
in addition to the pas, yeast atg6/vps30 also re-
sides at the endosome and on the vacuolar membrane
(obara et al., 2006), and mammalian beclin 1 localizes
to the tgn (kihara et al., 2001b). although the local-
ization of atatg6 to endomembranes was not detected
under our experimental conditions, we cannot exclude
the possibility that plant atg6/vps30/beclin 1 may
function in part through the endomembrane system to
control vesicle trafﬁcking.
precise molecular mechanisms by which atg6/vps30/
beclin 1 proteins regulate autophagosome formation
plants. first, a yeast complementation assay demon-
strated that expression of atatg6 partially restored
autophagy in atg6/vps30 yeast. liu et al. (2005) re-
cently showed that arabidopsis beclin 1 (atatg6)
rescued autophagy in atg6/vps30 yeast cells, in agree-
ment with our results. however, it has thus far been
unclear as to whether plant or mammal beclin
1 homologs are effective in trafﬁcking events, such as
cpy sorting. in this article, we show that expression of
atatg6 rescued atg6/vps30 yeast from the mis-sorting
of cpyprotein. although it has not been determined in

have not yet been described in any organisms. in yeast,
atg6/vps30 associates with vps34, a phosphatidylin-
ositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase; kihara et al., 2001a). recent
studies have suggested that targeting of atg6/vps30
and vps34 to the pas is critical
for subsequent
autophagosome formation (obara et al., 2006). vps34
may be recruited to the pas by atg14, a connector
protein that binds vps34 and atg6/vps30, and then
phosphatidlylinositol-3 phosphate (pi3-p) produced
by pi3-kinase at the pas could subsequently recruit
other proteins involved in autophagosome formation
(obara et al., 2006). atg6/vps30 seems indispensable
for atg14 function because atg14 is unstable in atg6/
vps30 yeast cells (kihara et al., 2001a). although no
atg14 homologs have been found in plants or ani-
mals, it is tempting to speculate that atatg6 may
interact with an unidentiﬁed pi3-kinase regulatory
protein that would direct the speciﬁcity of pi3-kinase
activity toward autophagosome formation, possibly by
recruiting the pi3-kinase complex to the putative pas
in arabidopsis cells.
a number of arabidopsis atg mutants have been
isolated thus far, each of which has exhibited retarded
growth under nutrient starvation and accelerated
senescence
even under nutrient-rich conditions
(thompson and vierstra, 2005; bassham et al., 2006).
similarly, virus-induced gene silencing of tobacco
(nicotiana tabacum) autophagy genes,
including a
beclin 1/atg6 homolog (nbatg6), enhanced yel-
lowing of leaves under environmental stress, such
as pathogen attack or dark-induced senescence (liu
et al., 2005). in this particular gene-silencing system,
no difference was apparent between the phenotypes of
nbatg6- and other nbatg-silenced plants. in con-
trast, we assumed that the atg6/vps30 mutant would
reveal more severe phenotypes than other atg mutants
because yeast atg6/vps30 mediates various biological
pathways, including autophagy. accordingly, of the
atatg plants examined thus far, only atatg6 mutants
exhibited pollen tube germination abnormalities. this
phenotype was not ascribed to autophagy because
none of the atatg mutants (except atatg6) has exhibited
male gametophytic defects (thompson and vierstra,
2005; bassham et al., 2006; this study). as described
above,
this ﬁnding supports our hypothesis that
atatg6/vps30 may have an autophagy-independent
role responsible for pollen germination.
the compelling question, then,
is how atatg6
mediates pollen germination. extensive studies have
identiﬁed several key components for pollen tube
growth; one of these is vesicular trafﬁcking (hepler
et al., 2001; monteiro et al., 2005). the tip of the pollen
tube contains numerous vesicles that could provide
precursor materials for the rapidly expanding cell wall
of the growing cells. arabidopsis vps homologs,
including vcl1 (vps16) and pok (vps52), seem to
play roles in germinating pollen tubes (hicks et al.,
2004; lobstein et al., 2004). similarly, it is possible that
atatg6/vps30 may be involved in the trafﬁcking
machinery that is crucial for pollen tube elongation.
dual functions of arabidopsis atg6/vps30
another possible explanation is that atatg6-
mediated pi3-kinase signaling might be involved in
pollen germination because pi3-p is known to act as a
second messenger and modulate a variety of cellular
activities in plants (meijer and munnik, 2003). previous
studies described roles of another phosphoinositide,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, during cytoskele-
tal organization and membrane trafﬁcking, which may
regulate cell elongation of root hairs and of pollen
tubes (kost et al., 1999; vincent et al., 2005). to our knowl-
edge, however, the involvement of pi3-p in pollen tube
germination has not been reported. atatg6-disrupted
pollen, which completely lacks atatg6 but is still viable,
would serve as a useful system to further investi-
gate the molecular mechanisms underlying pi3-kinase-
regulated polarized cell growth.
finally, despite its inhibitory effects on pollen ger-
mination, the atatg6 mutation affected neither the func-
tions of female gametophytes nor the viability of pollen,
suggesting that atatg6 is not essential for growth of
germ cells. nevertheless, this does not necessarily
exclude the possibility that disruption of atatg6 dras-
tically affects various developmental processes in
plants. for instance, if atatg6 homozygous plants were
available, their early embryonic development would be
severely damaged, as shown in atvps34-suppressed
transgenic arabidopsis (welters et al., 1994). in ani-
mals, suppression of beclin 1 affected dauer devel-
opment (mele´ndez et al., 2003) and cell death (yu et al.,
2004). suppression of atatg6 by antisense or rnai
techniques would unveil another unanticipated phys-
iological signiﬁcance of atg6/vps30/beclin1 genes,
in addition to atatg6-mediated pollen germination.
materials and methods
complementation of yeast mutants
an orf of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) atg6 (at3g61710; the
arabidopsis information resource [tair]; http://www.arabidopsis.org)
was fused with the 5# ﬂanking sequence (2816 to 21 relative to the initiation
codon) of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) atg6/vps30 in the prs416 vector. a
genomic fragment of yeast atg6/vps30 (2952 to 12,325; kametaka et al.,
1998) was inserted into prs416 as a control. wild-type yeast (strain by4741)
and an atg6/vps30 deletion mutant (y2132; giaever et al., 2002) were then
transformed with these plasmids.
for autophagy complementation experiments, cells were grown at 30°c to
the mid-log stage (od600 of 1.0–1.5) in synthetic medium (0.67% [w/v] yeast
nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium) supplemented with 2%
(w/v) glc, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (w/v) casamino acid, and
0.002% (w/v) trp. cells were then collected, washed, and incubated for
another 5 h in the synthetic medium in the presence of 1 mm phenyl-
methylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. accumulation of autophagic bodies was observed
using a differential interference contrast microscope (ix81; olympus).
for vps complementation, cells under 5 h of nitrogen starvation were
collected by centrifugation and used to prepare intracellular extracts, whereas
the supernatant was collected as the extracellular fraction. preparation of cell
extracts and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously
(hamasaki et al., 2005).

subcellular localization of atatg6 protein fused
with gfp derivatives
the orf of atatg6 or atatg8a (yoshimoto et al., 2004) was fused to the c
terminus of enhanced gfp in the pezs-cl plasmid (carnegie institution of
washington). the orfs of atatg6 and atatg8i were c-terminally fused to
enhanced cfp or enhanced yfp (p2cgw7 and p2ygw7, karimi et al., 2005)
using gateway technology (invitrogen). venus-tagged syp31, syp41, and
syp81 were used as the golgi, tgn, and er marker proteins, respectively
(uemura et al., 2004). transient expression of ﬂuorescence proteins in arabi-
dopsis suspension cells was performed as described in ueda et al. (2001). bfa
treatment was performed as described previously (uemura et al., 2004). cells
were observed using an epiﬂuorescence microscope (olympus ix81).
microscopic observation of pollen
pollen grains were germinated in the dark at 22°c on an agar plate
containing 0.6% agar, 13.5% suc, 30 mg ml21 myoinositol, 0.4 mm boric acid,
10 mm cacl2, and 1 mm kcl.
sections of mature pollen were observed using a jem-2000ex transmission
electron microscope (jeol) as described by yoshimoto et al. (2004).
pollen was observed in the chamber of an esem (philips xl30; fei electron
optics) at 2°c under 650 to 660 pa of pressure with an acceleration voltage of
15 kv. images were processed using adobe photoshop 6.0 (adobe systems).
staining of pollen with 4#,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) or aniline
blue was performed as described previously (regan and moffatt, 1990;
shimizu and okada, 2000).
rt-pcr
arabidopsis plants were grown hydroponically for 4 to 5 weeks (hanaoka
et al., 2002) and each organ was harvested. flowers at different developmental
stages were collected as described by gupta et al. (2002). rna was extracted
from each sample using trizol reagent (gibco-brl) and treated with dnase i.
cdna was synthesized using a prostar ﬁrst-strand rt-pcr kit (stratagene).
the primers used were atatg6, 5#-gctgaagtaaaccatcaactg-3# and
5#-gttacacatcgtatggaggag-3#; ubiquitin10 (ubq10, at4g05320),
5#-gcagatctttgttaagactc-3# and 5#-ccaaagtgatagttttcccag-3#;
pok (at1g71270), 5#-ggtgttaagtgcacattttcgtg-3# and 5#-tcacc-
aaagaaatcatcacaaaa-3#; and atpten1 (at5g39400), 5#-atgggtct-
