the target of rapamycin (tor) plays a pivotal role in cell growth and metabolism. yeast contains
two related proteins, tor1 and tor2. in ﬁssion yeast, tor1 is dispensable for normal growth but is
involved in amino acid uptake and cell survival under various stress conditions. in contrast, tor2
is essential for cell proliferation; however, its physiological function remains unknown. here we

introduction
the target of rapamycin [tor, also known as frap
(fkbp12-rapamycine-associated  protein),  raft
(rapamycin and fkbp12 target) and rapt (rapamycin
target)] is a highly conserved 280 kda ser/thr kinase
that plays a central role in the control of cell growth and
metabolism (martin & hall 2005; wullschleger 
. 2006).
tor proteins comprise several functional domains (see
fig. 1) (schmelzle & hall 2000). the large n-terminal
region (
2000 amino acids) consists of stretches of heat
repeats,  which  mediate  protein–protein  interactions
(kunz 
. 2000; perry & kleckner 2003). the follow-
ing  c-terminal 
500  amino  acid  residues  contain  the

several non-tor components, in which some of them

recent evidence indicates that the tuberous sclerosis

regulator of mtor (gao

the tsc complex is attributed to the ability of the tsc

 binding of
the rapamycin-fkbp12 complex to torc1, a mode
of action that is conserved from yeast to human, inhibits
the tor kinase activity and elicits a number of responses

hand, rapamycin-insensitive torc2 is required for the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton (jacinto

+ is not essential for growth
that, as in budding yeast, 
while tor2+ is essential. the null mutant for tor1+(tor1∆)
has defects in cell survival under various stress conditions
such as high osmolarity, low and high ph, high temper-
ature, and certain drugs including hydroxyurea (kawai
et al.  2001;  weisman  &  choder  2001).  the  deletion
mutant is also defective in the nitrogen-starvation response,
in which on nitrogen depletion, unlike wild-type cells,
tor1∆ cells fail to arrest the cell cycle at g1, which is a
prerequisite for sexual development. as a result, tor1∆
is sterile. tor1 has been shown to phosphorylate and
activate an agc kinase/s6k gad8 (matsuo et al. 2003),
which regulates the growth under stress conditions and
the  nitrogen-starvation  response  through  unknown
mechanisms. in contrast to the knowledge of tor1, the
cellular functions of tor2 remain to be studied (kawai
et al. 2001; weisman & choder 2001).
in order to dissect the physiological roles of tor2, we
created temperature-sensitive tor2 mutants and charac-
terized these phenotypes. we present evidence that tor2
mutants mimic the nitrogen-starvation response at the
restrictive  temperature,  suggesting  that tor2  is  a  key
molecule that senses a nitrogen source, thereby allowing
cell  proliferation  under  nutrient-rich  conditions.
furthermore,  both  biochemical  and  genetic  analyses
indicate that rhb1 and tor2 act in the same pathway that
corroborates with tor1.

results
isolation of tor2ts mutants and determination 
of mutation sites
to create tor2 temperature sensitive mutants, pcr-based
mutagenesis was carried out that targeted the c-terminal
region containing the kinase and fatc domains (fig. 1a,
upper). two temperature sensitive mutants were obtained,
and  nucleotide  sequencing  analysis  revealed  that  they
constitute different tor2 alleles, referred to as tor2ts-13 and
tor2ts-19, respectively. both tor2ts-13 and tor2ts-19 mutants
grew normally on rich ye5s plates when cultured at
26 °c, but they did not form colonies at 36 °c (fig. 1b).
three  amino  acid  changes  were  found  in  tor2ts-13:
cys2163 to arg, ile2280 to val and gln2305 to leu. arg2163
was  situated  in  the  highly  conserved  kinase  domain,
while val2280  and  leu2305  were  present  in  a  gap  region
between  the  kinase  domain  and  the  fatc  domain
(fig. 1a,  lower).  in  tor2ts-19,  there  were  two  mutation
sites: ile2241 to thr, and ser2293 to pro. thr2241 was present
in a gap region and pro2293 located in the fatc domain.
this suggests that the gap region and the fatc domain
as well as the kinase domain are critical for tor2 activity
and cell survival.
tor2ts mutants display g1-cell cycle arrest with 
a small cell size at the restrictive temperature
tor2ts-13  and  tor2ts-19  mutants  did  not  grow  on ye5s
plates  when  cultured  at  36 °c  (fig. 1b). the  mutant
cells  were  then  examined  for  growth  in ye5s  liquid
medium. cells were cultured in ye5s at 26 °c to a mid-
log phase (3 × 106 cells/ml), transferred to a fresh ye5s
and then shifted to 36 °c. while wild-type cells continued
to divide, tor2ts-13 cells ceased increasing in cell number
after approximately two rounds of cell division (fig. 2a).
prior to the temperature shift, both cell size and shape
were  normal  in  tor2ts-13. when  cultured  at  36 °c,  in
contrast,  the  mutant  cells  became  shorter  in  size  and
almost round (fig. 2b). at 4 h and 8 h after the shift to
36 °c, the average cell length was reduced to 6.4 µm and
6.2 µm, respectively, which were ∼50% decreases com-
pared to wild-type cells (13.0 µm and 12.9 µm). similar
results were obtained for tor2ts-19. it is of note that, in
contrast to the reduced length, the cell width remained
constant in these mutant cells.
in s. pombe, the g1 phase is very short during expo-
nentially growing cycles, so that most of the cells display
the 2c content of dna and few cells show the 1c peak
(moreno et al. 1991). when starved for nitrogen, on the
other hand, the cells divide twice and then arrest at g1

with a small cell size (egel & egel-mitani 1974; kumada
et al. 1995). the small cell-size phenotypes of tor2 mutants
described above led us to examine whether tor2ts-13 and
tor2ts-19 mutants mimic the nitrogen-starvation response.
in order to address this point, the mutant cells were ana-
lyzed with ﬂow cytometry. before the temperature shift,
almost no 1c peak was present in either mutant (and also
wild-type  cells,  fig. 2c).  in  sharp  contrast,  1c  peaks
appeared at 4 h and became larger as incubation con-
tinued.  these  results  indicate  that  both  tor2ts-13  and
tor2ts-19 mutants tend to arrest at g1 with a small cell size
and suggest that these mutants responded as if they were
starved for nitrogen.
tor2ts mutants induce autophagy and are competent 
for sexual differentiation under nutrient-rich 
conditions
under  nitrogen  deprivation,  two  major  physiological
changes  are  known  to  occur,  autophagy  and  sexual
differentiation. we next sought to examine whether tor2ts
mutants display these responses at the restrictive temper-
ature. first, the mutant cells were examined to see if they
conducted autophagy when cultured at 36 °c. because
autophagy accompanies large-scale protein degradation
(nakashima  et al.  2006),  the  production  of  free  amino
acids  was  examined.  for  this  purpose,  cells  had  been

labeled with l-[14c] phe at 26 °c and then transferred to

followed by a temperature shift to 36 °c. at the indi-
cated  times,  the  amount  of  protein  degradation  was
measured  by  counting  the  acid-soluble  radioactivity.
proteins are insoluble to acid but amino acids and small
peptides derived from protein degradation are soluble
to acid. thus, radioactivity in acid solution reﬂects the
amount of protein degradation. when cultured at 26 °c,
tor2ts-13 as well as the wild-type showed only a basal level
of protein degradation (fig. 3a), which conﬁrmed that
autophagy was repressed under nutrient-rich conditions
at the permissive temperature in both tor2ts-13 and wild-
type. upon a temperature shift to 36 °c, however, tor2ts-13
cells showed a signiﬁcant amount of protein degradation,
which increased as the incubation time was prolonged.
in contrast, wild-type cells showed only a marginal increase
in  radioactivity. these  results  imply  that  the  protein
degradation observed in tor2ts-13 was not due to the general
response to heat shock; instead the inactivation of tor2
did impose autophagy as if tor2ts-13 cells responded to
nitrogen  starvation.  in  tor2ts-19,  such  protein  degrada-
tion was obscure (data not shown), the reason for which
is unclear. it is possible that the residual tor2 activity is
retained in tor2ts-19 mutant cells, which is sufﬁcient to
inhibit autophagy.
nitrogen starvation also triggers sexual differentiation
(egel & egel-mitani 1974), which includes conjugation
and spore formation. s. pombe has two mating types h+
and h–. when starved for nitrogen, haploid cells begin to

conjugate with the opposite mating type of the cell. in
order to investigate this point, homothallic strains were
constructed  in  the  tor2ts-13  or  tor2ts-19  background.
cells of the homothallic wild-type, tor2ts-13 or tor2ts-19
strains  were  placed  on ye5s  plates  and  cultured  for  2
days at 33 °c (the highest temperature that allows con-
jugation in the wild-type cells under nitrogen starvation,
nurse & bissett 1981). strikingly, more than 70% of
the  tor2ts-13  cells  committed  sexual  development  to
form zygotes and spores (fig. 3b,c). tor2ts-19 also initi-
ated  sexual  differentiation  albeit  with  less  efﬁciency
(16%) and, in contrast, wild-type cells displayed sexual
development at a minimal level (7%). taking these results
together, we conclude that tor2ts-13 and tor2ts-19 mimic
the  nitrogen-starvation  response  when  shifted  to  the
restriction  temperature. the  above  results  demonstrate
that tor2ts mutants mimic nitrogen starvation response at
the restrictive temperatures.
tor2ts mutants induce expression of the nitrogen 
starvation-speciﬁc gene
we then examined whether the mutants would express
the genes that are speciﬁc for nitrogen starvation. isp6+
encodes a vacuolar protease that is essential for autophagy
and its expression is induced speciﬁcally with nitrogen
starvation  (nakashima  et al.  2002,  2006). as  shown  in
fig. 3d, isp6+ was expressed at a basal level in tor2ts-13
cells before temperature shift; however, it became highly
expressed  as  incubated  at  36 °c.  in  contrast,  such  an
expression pattern was not observed in wild-type cells.
a house keeping gene, nda3 (encoding β-tubulin), did
not show such induction. the same experiment was
carried out for tor2ts-19, which showed a similar pattern.
the results indicate that tor2ts mutants expressed nitrogen
starvation speciﬁc genes on shift to the restrictive tem-
perature  and  support  the  notion  that  tor2ts  mutants
mimic nitrogen starvation responses.
tor1∆∆∆∆ tor2ts double mutants display additive 
phenotypes of each single mutant
as described earlier, in s. pombe, tor is encoded by two
genes,  tor1+  and  tor2+,  in  which  tor2+  is  essential  for
proliferation  (weisman  &  choder  2001).  in  contrast,
tor1+ is a nonessential gene; tor1-deletion results in slow
growth and hypersensitivity to various stresses, suggest-
ing that the activity of tor1 is important for cell survival
especially when the cells are exposed to an adverse envi-
ronment (kawai et al. 2001; wesiman & choder 2001).
furthermore, tor1∆ was unable to respond properly to
nitrogen starvation. in order to examine the function of
tor1 and tor2 in cell proliferation and stress response, we
created tor1∆tor2ts-13 and tor1∆tor2ts-19 double mutants
and observed their phenotypes. first we examined the
growth of the double mutants at varying temperatures.
the mutant cells were spotted on to ye5s plates using
a 10-times serial dilution and were cultured for 3 days.
both  tor2ts-13  and  tor2ts-19  mutants  grew  normally  at
26 °c, 30 °c and even at 32 °c (ﬁfth and sixth rows in
fig. 4a).  tor1∆  could  also  form  colonies  well  at  these
temperatures. the tor1∆tor2ts-13 double mutant, on the
other hand, grew only marginally at 30 °c and did not
do  so  at  32 °c  (the  third  row).  similar  results  were
observed  for  tor1∆tor2ts-19. these  results  demonstrate
that tor1 as well as tor2 is important for cell proliferation
and,  furthermore,  although  tor1  is  dispensable,  tor1
becomes necessary for cell growth when tor2 function
is compromised.
in order to address this point further, we observed cell
division in ye5s liquid medium. cells were cultured at
26 °c to a mid-log phase, transferred to a fresh medium,
and then incubated at 36 °c (fig. 4b). both tor1∆tor2ts-13
and tor1∆tor2ts-19 double mutants stopped proliferation
earlier than the tor2ts-13 and tor2ts-19 single mutants. prior
to the temperature shift, tor1∆tor2ts-13 and tor1∆tor2ts-19
showed almost normal cell size, 13.2 µm and 12.9 µm,
respectively (fig. 4c). at 4 h and 8 h after being cultured
at 36 °c, the cell length of tor1∆tor2ts-19 was 14.5 µm
and 14.2 µm, respectively, which indicates that, in sharp
contrast to tor2ts-19, the cell size was not decreased (fig. 2c).
similar  results  were  also  obtained  for  tor1∆tor2ts-13
(fig. 4c). in this case, the cell size was somewhat decreased;
however, it was still longer than that of tor2ts-13, 9.9 µm
and 6.4 µm for tor1∆tor2ts-13 and tor2ts-13 at 4 h, respec-
tively. it should be noted that the cell length of tor1∆ was
not decreased when starved for nitrogen (kawai et al. 2001;
weisman & choder 2001). given that tor2ts mutants mimic
the  physiologies  of  nitrogen  starvation,  as  described
earlier, failure to decrease the cell length in the double
mutant seems to correspond to the appearance of tor1∆
phenotypes in the tor2ts mutant background. it therefore
appears  that  the  tor1∆tor2ts  double  mutants  display
additive phenotypes of each single mutant.
it is shown that, when starved for nitrogen, tor1∆ is
defective  in  g1  arrest  (kawai  et al.  2001;  weisman  &
choder  2001). we  then  examined  this  point  by  ﬂow
cytometry. on the temperature shift, unlike a tor2ts-19

the 2c peak, and no 1c peak appeared at 36 °c (fig. 4d).
similar results were obtained for tor1∆tor2ts-13, although
a small 1c peak appeared after incubation for 4 h. taken
together, the results presented here led us to the following
idea. when tor2 is inactivated, the cells cease proliferation

if the function of tor1 is simultaneously lost, the cells fail
to  divide  at  a  reduced  cell  size,  and  as  a  result,  they
became neither arrested at g1 nor smaller (fig. 4c,d).
tor2 physically interacts with a small gtpase rhb1
several groups have reported that a novel small gtp-
binding  protein,  rheb,  binds  and  activates  mtor
(long et al. 2005). s. pombe has a rheb counterpart gene,
rhb1+  (mach  et al.  2000).  intriguingly,  rhb1  mutants,  in
which its expression is turned off by promoter shut-off
systems, display phenotypes very similar to tor2ts described
earlier. bearing this in mind, we next examined whether
rhb1 would interact with tor2. in order to detect these
two proteins, tor2 was tagged with ha and rhb1 with
gfp at each n-terminus, and their own promoters were
replaced  with  the  thiamine-repressible  nmt1  promoter
(maundrell 1993; bähler et al. 1998). the cells that over-
express both ha-tor2 and gfp-rhb1 were cultured in
liquid  medium  without  thiamine,  and  protein  extracts

were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation. as
shown in fig. 5a, gfp-rheb was co-precipitated with
ha-tor2. when the cells were cultured in the presence of
thiamine (repressed condition), co-immunoprecipitation
of rhb1 and tor2 was not observed (data not shown),
probably because the amount of each protein was not
sufﬁcient  for  detection  of  the  interaction. this  result
demonstrates  that  rhb1  and tor2  interact  physically
with each other, at least under overproduction conditions.
genetic interaction between tor2+ and rhb1+
having seen the physical interaction, we next sought
the genetic interaction between rhb1+ and tor2+. as pre-
viously described, tor1∆ was unable to survive under stress
conditions  such  as  high  osmotic  pressure  and  certain
drugs (fig. 5b). we reasoned these defects of tor1∆ in the
following  manner.  in  tor1∆,  in  which  only  the tor2
pathway is functional, the basal level of tor2 activity
is sufﬁcient to support cell division under normal con-
ditions, but it is not sufﬁcient under stress conditions.
if this is the case, when the tor2 pathway is activated,
tor1∆ cells may become viable under stress conditions.
we  have  shown  that,  as  in  mammalian  cells, tor2
binds  rhb1  (fig. 5a),  and  therefore  we  expected  that
over-expression of rhb1+ would stimulate tor2 activity,
thereby  rescuing  the  growth  defects  of  tor1∆  in  stress
response. to this end, the promoter of rhb1+ was replaced
with the nmt1+ promoter. as shown in fig. 5b, tor1∆rhb1+
o/e (rhb1+-over-expressing tor1∆) cells were capable of
growing on the plates in the presence of either 1 m kcl
or 4 mm hydroxyurea (the third row, fig. 5b). in animals,
the tsc1/tsc2 complex negatively regulates rheb, and
inactivation of either tsc1 or tsc2 results in the hyper-
activation  of  rheb  (inoki  et al.  2003;  saucedo  et al.
2003;  stocker  et al.  2003;  tee  et al.  2003;  zhang  et al.
2003). we  constructed  tor1∆tsc2∆  cells  and  examined
their growth under stress conditions. as expected, these
double mutants behaved the same as tor1∆rhb1+o/e cells,
in  which  growth  was  restored  under  stress  conditions
(the fourth row). these results substantiated the notion
that, in ﬁssion yeast, tor2 acts downstream of rhb1 and
that tor1 and tor2 share functions under adverse growth
conditions.
actin organization in tor2ts mutants
in  s.  cerevisiae, torc1  operates  the  growth  of  cells,
whose inhibition leads cells to show nitrogen starvation-
like response (loewith et al. 2002; jacinto & hall 2003),
while torc2  is  required  for  the  organization  of  the
actin cytoskeleton (jacinto et al. 2004). our results strongly
suggest  that tor2  in  s.  pombe  functions  as torc1;
however, it is also possible that tor2 is involved in actin
organization because tor2 is essential as in s. cerevisiae. in
s. cerevisiae, actin patches localize at buds; however, they
became dispersed after temperature shift in tor2ts mutants
(helliwell  et al.  1998;  jacinto  et al.  2004).  in  s.  pombe,
actin localizes at the growing tips or the septa of cells and
it also makes ﬁbers along the long axis (fig. 6a). when
cultured at 26 °c, both tor2ts-13 and tor2ts-19 cells showed
the actin organization patterns similar to wild-type cells
(fig. 6b,c). at 2 h after shift to 36 °c, actin still localized
at  the  tips  of  the  cells  in  either  tor2ts-13  or  tor2ts-19
although it seemed slightly displaced from cell tips. the
results  suggest  that tor2  is  not  critically  important  for
action organization.
discussion
although ﬁssion yeast tor2+ is known to play an essential
role in viability (weisman & choder 2001), its precise
role in cell proliferation has not been investigated. in this

study,  we  have  obtained  and  characterized  two  tor2
temperature-sensitive mutants. remarkably, when cultured
at the restrictive temperature, the tor2ts mutants mimic
nitrogen starvation responses. these include g1 cell-cycle
arrest  with  a  small  cell  size  (fig. 2a–c),  induction  of
autophagy  and  competence  for  sexual  differentiation
(fig. 3a–c). furthermore, the tor2ts mutants expressed a
nitrogen starvation speciﬁc gene, isp6+, when shifted to
the restrictive temperature (fig. 3d). these results have
led us to propose a working hypothesis that tor2 senses
the  nitrogen  source,  thereby  preventing  physiological
changes  that  are  normally  induced  only  on  nitrogen
deprivation. it also implies that the activity of tor2 may
become reduced on nitrogen consumption, which makes
the cells cease proliferation, arrest at g1 and switch to the
physiological status suitable for nutrient-starved conditions.
the c-terminal 33 residues of tor form the fatc
domain. deletion of the c-terminal trp as well as small
deletions (three or more residues) of the c-terminus
abolished mtor activity both in vivo and in vitro (peterson
et al.  2000;  takahashi  et al.  2000).  a  recent  study  has
shown that the fatc domain forms a novel structural
motif consisting of an α-helix and a c-terminal disulﬁde
bonded  loop  (dames  et al.  2005).  the  ﬂexibility  of
fatc changed upon reduction of the disulﬁde bond.
therefore, the fatc domain may function to regulate
the kinase activity of tor. in tor2ts-13, one mutation
site out of three resides in the fatc domain, which
supports the importance of this domain. failure of the
epitope-tagging of tor2 at its c-terminus is consistent
with this notion (m. uritani, unpublished observation).
in tor2ts-13, another mutation site was found at the gap
region, and in tor2ts-19, all mutation sites were located at
the gap region. the gap region consists of 70 amino acid
residues,  which  are  located  between  the  kinase  and
fatc domains. the signiﬁcance of the gap region remains
to be clariﬁed; however, our results suggest that the gap
region is crucial for tor activity.

figure 7 a  model  of tor1  and tor2  functions  in  ﬁssion  yeast.
tor1  and tor2  play  both  overlapping  and  separate  roles  in  cell
proliferation and survival under nitrogen-rich and adverse growth
conditions.  rhb1-gtpase  appears  to  act  upstream  of tor2

growth to a nitrogen-starvation response (helliwell et al.
1998).  in  contrast,  in  ﬁssion  yeast,  although  growth  is
not inhibited by rapamycin even at high concentrations
(weisman et al. 1997; kawai et al. 2001), as shown in this
study, inactivation of tor2 alone is sufﬁcient to commit
the cell to the nitrogen-starvation response. only tor2
but  not tor1  may  fulﬁlll  the  budding  yeast  equivalent
“rapamycin-sensitive”  function.  it  is  also  possible  that
tor2  plays  a  major  role  in  the “rapamycin-sensitive”
events, while that of tor1 is minor. in agreement with
this idea, tor2 did not seem to play an important role in
actin organization (fig. 6), while in the budding yeast,
the “rapamycin-insensitive” function of tor2 is to organ-
ize the actin cytoskeleton (helliwell et al. 1998; jacinto
et al. 2004). if the above idea is true, tor2 mutants may be
obtained  that  are  sensitive  to  rapamycin  in  the  tor1∆
background. the tor2ts mutants described in this study did
not show rapamycin sensitivity. we have recently obtained
rapamycin-sensitive  tor2  mutants  and  their  analysis  is
underway (m. uritani, unpublished observations).
previous reports have indicated that tor1+ is necessary
for  the  proper  response  to  nitrogen  starvation  (kawai
et al. 2001; weisman & choder 2001). given the notion
that tor2  plays  a  crucial  role  in  nitrogen  signaling  as
shown in the current work, this function of tor1 agrees
with our data that tor1∆tor2ts mutants failed to mimic
a  nitrogen-starvation  response  when  cultured  at  the
restrictive  temperature  (fig. 4b–d). the  precise  func-
tion of tor1 and tor2 is still unclear and further study is
necessary. at present, we have a working hypothesis that
tor1  is  necessary  for  physiological  alterations  against
nitrogen  starvation,  while tor2  prevents  them,  and  its
inactivation triggers these responses even in the presence
of nitrogen sources (fig. 7).
s. pombe has all the counterparts of the components
of torc1 and torc2. for example, it has mip1 for
raptor/kog1, wat1/pop3  for  lst8,  sin1  for avo1  and
ste20  for  rictor/avo3  (kemp  et al.  1997;  hilti  et al.
1999;  wilkinson  et al.  1999;  shinozaki-yabana  et al.
2000; ochotorena et al. 2001). all pop3+, sin1+ and ste20+
genes are nonessential, in which these deletion mutants
show  phenotypes  similar  to  those  of  tor1∆  (hilti  et al.
1999;  wilkinson  et al.  1999;  kawai  et al.  2001;  ocho-
torena et al. 2001; weisman & choder 2001). avo1 and
rictor/avo3  are  speciﬁc  components  for  the torc2
complex, and thus in ﬁssion yeast tor1, but not tor2 as
in budding yeast, might interact with sin1 and ste20 to
form torc2.  in  contrast,  mip1+  is  an  essential  gene,
and similar to tor2+, its role is related to nitrogen starvation
and mating response pathways (shinozaki-yabana et al.
2000). raptor/kog1 is speciﬁc for torc1. it is there-
fore possible that tor2 and mip1 form torc1, again
different from the budding yeast system, in which tor1
and tor2 form torc1. obviously, more biochemical
study  with  regard  to tor-complexes  is  necessary  for
further understanding of the roles of tor1 and tor2 in
ﬁssion yeast. we are currently undertaking investigation
of the physical interaction between tor2 and mip1.
both  the  physical  and  genetic  interactions  between
tor2 and rhb1 presented in this work (fig. 5a,b) strongly
suggest  that  rhb1  is  an  upstream  element  of  the
tor2-mediated signaling pathway (fig. 7). in line with
this, recently urano et al. (2005) also reported binding
between  a  hyperactive  rheb  protein  and tor2,  and
furthermore, an rhb1 shut-off mutant strain is known
to  display  g1-mimicking  phenotypes  similar  to  tor2ts
(mach et al. 2000). we have been attempting to identify
the downstream molecules of tor2 by screening for
multicopy suppressors of tor2ts mutants. understanding
of  tor-mediated  growth  factor/nutrient  signaling
pathways would be our ﬁnal goal.

creation of tor2ts mutants
tor2ts mutants were obtained as follows. first, the kanr cassette was
inserted just after the open reading frame of tor2+. using the set of
primers,  cctcctctttgagtgttcgtaaatctgtgc  and  acaatataaagagatgcattctc-
tactaca, a dna fragment was ampliﬁed which was from 200 bp
upstream from the conserved ser1817 that is responsible for fkbp-
rapamycin binding in s. cerevisiae and to 200 bp downstream of
the kanr insertion. this 3.4 kb dna fragment was mutagenized
with  error-prone  pcr.  513  (h–  leu1–32  ura4-d18)  was  trans-
formed with the dna fragment. from ∼500 g418-resistant
colonies, the two colonies were selected that grew on ye5s plates
at 26 °c but not at 36 °c. marker insertion, replacement of the
promoter, and tagging were carried out as previously described
(bähler et al. 1998).
measurement of protein degradation
protein  degradation  was  measured  as  previously  described
(nakashima  et al.  2006).  in  brief,  mid-log  cells  were  labeled
with [u-14c]l-phenylalanine (1.85 mbq/mmol) at a ﬁnal con-
centration  of  11.1  kbq/ml,  harvested,  washed  twice  with
emm3-n,  and  incubated  in  emm3-n  at  30 °c. at  intervals,
aliquots  (0.1 ml)  of  the  culture  were  withdrawn,  mixed
quickly  with  11 µl  of  100%  trichloroacetic  acid  solution,  and
kept on ice overnight. to the suspension, 11 µl of a bovine serum
albumin  solution  (10 mg/ml)  was  added  and  mixed  well. the
mixture  was  centrifuged  at  12000 g  for  15 min  at  4 °c,  the
supernatant  was  spotted  on  to  a  paper  disk  (whatman  3 mm
2.4-cm diameter), and the radioactivity on the disk was meas-
ured  with  a  liquid  scintillation  counter  after  drying.  results
were expressed as the percentage of radioactivity in the acid-
soluble fraction compared to the radioactivity in the initial total
fraction.
northern blotting
cells were cultured in ye5s at 26 °c, and the cells in the mid-log
phase were shifted to 36 °c and cultured at the times as indicated
in  fig. 3d. total  rna  (25 µg)  from  the  cells  was  subjected  to
northern hybridization with the entire coding region of isp6+ as
a  probe  (nakashima  et al.  2002). as  a  control  probe,  the  entire
region of nda3+ was used. ecl direct labeling and detection sys-
tem (ge healthcare) was used for detection.
others
general,  cytological  and  molecular  genetic  techniques  were
followed according to standard protocols (moreno et al. 1991).
transformation of s. pombe cells was performed by the lithium
acetate  method  (okazaki  et al.  1990).  cell-cycle  analyses  were
conducted as previously described (kawai et al. 2001).
