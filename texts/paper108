dna damaging agent-induced autophagy produces a
cytoprotective adenosine triphosphate surge in
malignant glioma cells
m katayama1, t kawaguchi1, ms berger1 and ro pieper*,1
although autophagy enhances cell survival in nutrient-deprived cells by increasing adenosine triphosphate (atp) production, it
remains unclear if autophagy functions similarly in cells treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. to address this issue, we
measured both the ability of dna damaging agents (temozolomide, and etoposide) to induce an autophagy-dependent
production of atp, and the effects of modulation of autophagy on drug-induced cell death. both drugs induced an autophagy-
associated increase in atp production in multiple glioma cell lines. the drug-induced atp surge could not be blocked by
glucose starvation, but could be blocked by preincubation with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-ma), an sirna
targeting beclin 1, or the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin. inhibition of autophagy-induced atp production increased non-
apoptotic cell death associated with micronucleation, while restoration of the 3-ma-inhibited atp surge by addition of pyruvate
suppressed cell death. these results show that dna damaging agents induce an autophagy-associated atp surge that protects
cells and may contribute to drug resistance.

autophagy is a process by which subcellular constituents are
degraded in autophagosomes/autolysosomes in response to
stress.1 whereas growth factors enhance the ability of
metazoan cells to take up extracelluar nutrients and suppress
autophagy, deprivation of either growth factors or extracellular
nutrients leads to decreased nutrient uptake and derepression
of autophagy. the catabolic autophagy process is believed to
allow starving cells to support adenosine triphosphate (atp)
production and avoid cell death.2,3
the autophagic process is regulated by both class i and
class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathways.2,4,5
mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) functions down-
stream of the class-i pi3k/akt, and is a key negative regulator
of autophagy. in this role, mtor serves as a metabolic sensor
that coordinates crosstalk between nutrient availability and
autophagy.6,7 in contrast, class iii pi3k positively regulates
autophagy. the formation of a preautophagosomal isolation
membrane that encloses cytoplasmic cargo is positively
regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, the products
of class iii pi3k phosphorylation.4 it has also been suggested
that the trafﬁcking of autophagosomes is regulated by class iii
pi3ks,4,5 an idea supported by the observation that 3-
methyladenine (3-ma), which inhibits class iii pi3k activity,
also inhibits autophagosome formation and is widely used as
an autophagy inhibitor.5
it is also known that autophagy is induced in cancer cells
derived from tissues such as breast, colon, prostate and brain
in response to a variety of anticancer therapies.3,8 however,
autophagy in response to these drugs can produce different
outcomes,
in some cases promoting cell adaptation and
survival similar to what is seen in nutrient deprived cells, while
in other cases, inducing programmed cell death type. the role
of drug-induced autophagy in cell death or survival is therefore
unresolved.3,8
temozolomide (tmz) is an alkylating agent which is widely
used for treating primary and recurrent high-grade gliomas.9
the cytotoxicity of tmz is thought to result from the formation
of o6-methylguanine in dna, which mispairs with thymine
during dna replication triggering futile cycles of the mismatch
repair system and subsequent dna damage.10 in glioma
cells, the dna damage induces a g2/m arrest, not apoptosis,
and cell death occurs mainly by cell death associated with
multimicronucleation, particularly in p53-deﬁcient cells.11,12 in
a previous study, it was shown that tmz induces autophagy,
and that pharmacological
inhibition of autophagy could
inﬂuence cellular oucome.13 the exact means by which this
occurred, however, and the potential role of autophagy -induced
atp production in the process, were not determined. in the
present study, we investigated the relationship between autop-
hagy, autophagy-associated atp production, and cell death in
response to tmz and a second dna damaging agent etoposide.

the absence of tmz, after which cells were analyzed by
facs for dna content. consistent with previous reports,11–13
cells accumulated with 4n dna content at
the g2–m
boundary, with ratio of 4n/2n dna content peaking 3 days
after tmz treatment and decreasing gradually to base levels
by 10 days post-tmz exposure (figures 1a and b).
tmz was previously shown in p53-deﬁcient glioma
cells to induce cell death characterized by multimicronuclea-
tion in the absence of cytoplasmic shrinkage (‘mitotic
catastrophe’).11,12 consistent with this observation, tmz
treated p53-deﬁcient u251 cells stained with hematoxylin/
eosin exhibited multiple, micronucleated nuclei in the absence
of cytoplasm shrinkage (arrows, figure 1c), with this form of
cell death peaking 5–7 days post-tmz exposure (2–4 days
after the maximal g2 arrest; figure 1b). consistent with
previous reports, no apoptotic cells were detected micro-
scopically or by cell cycle analysis (lack of cells with sub-g1
dna content).11–13
finally, because recent investigations also demonstrated
that radiation or chemotherapeutic agents including tmz
induce autophagy in malignant glioma cells,13,14 we mea-

lc3-ii form of map1-lc3 as early as 3 days after tmz
exposure, similar to what was noted following a 1-day
exposure of the cells to the known inducer of autophagy,
rapamycin. to further verify that tmz-induced autophagy was
occurring, we indirectly measured the activity of mtor, a key
suppressor of autophagy, by looking at activation of
its
downstream targets s6k and 4e-bp1 in tmz-treated cells.
as shown in figure 1e, the phosphorylation of s6k was
signiﬁcantly downregulated 3 days following tmz exposure,
and 4e-bp1 was progressively hypophosphorylated (faster
migrating band), consistent with downregulation of mtor
activity that accompanies autophagy. these results indicate
that tmz induces a g2 arrest followed by the induction of
autophagy and a form of cell death preceded by multi-
micronucleation (‘mitotic catastrophe’).
tmz-induced, autophagy-driven increases in atp levels
protect cells from the drug-induced cell death preceded
by multinucleation. because it has been reported that
autophagy provides mitochondria with substrates to maintain
oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of growth factors,15
we examined whether tmz-induced autophagy could have a
similar atp-producing effect. to assess the effects of tmz
on the levels of atp, we used a luciferin-luciferase based
atp bioluminescence method that has been described
previously.16 atp levels in u251 cells increased 3 days
following tmz exposure and peaked at over two times those
of control cells 7 days after tmz exposure, falling to control
levels by 14 days after tmz treatment (figure 2a). the time
course of
the atp surge was consistent with that of
autophagic processing of map1-lc3 to its lipidized form

(lc3-ii) (figure 1d), suggesting that this surge could be an
autophagy-related process.
to clarify whether the tmz-induced elevation of atp levels
was related to autophagy, we exposed cells to tmz (0 or
100 mm, 3 h), then incubated the cells with 3-ma (a pi3k
inhibitor widely used as a pharmacological
inhibitor of
autophagy), for 2 days beginning 3 days after tmz exposure,
and monitored effects on atp production and autophagy.
while 3-ma alone had no effect on atp levels, the tmz-
induced atp surge (0 mm group; figure 2b) was inhibited by
the addition of 3-ma in a dose dependent manner. 3-ma
similarly did not alter the distribution between map1-lc3
forms (not shown), but inhibited the tmz-induced conversion
of map1-lc3 to a lipidized form (figure 2c). to determine if
the autophagy-associated surge in atp was related to cell
outcome, we also monitored the percentage of cells under-
going multimicronucleation in cells treated similarly with tmz,
3-ma or both. while a 2–4 day treatment with 3-ma up to
10 mm alone did not induce cell death (data not shown), the
delayed 3-ma exposure that suppressed the tmz-induced
atp surge also signiﬁcantly increased the percentage of cells
undergoing multimicronucleation in a dose-dependent man-
ner (figures 2d and e).
because 3-ma is a relatively nonspeciﬁc inhibitor of
autophagy, especially when used at high concentrations, we
repeated the studies in figure 2 using an short hair pin rna
(shrna) targeting beclin-1, a key component of autophago-
some formation. as shown in the western blot in figure 3a,
u251 cells stably expressing beclin shrna exhibited sig-
niﬁcantly lower levels of beclin 1 relative to cells expressing a
nontargeted shrna (shnegctrl). cells expressing beclin
shrna also exhibited reduced conversion of map1-lc3 to

a lipidized form 3 days after tmz treatment (figure 3b),
suggesting as expected that suppression of beclin 1 levels
suppressed tmz-induced autophagy. shrna-mediated sup-
pression of beclin 1 did not alter atp levels in control cells
(compare light gray bars in figure 3c) but did signiﬁcantly
suppress the atp surge noted in shneg control cells 5 days
following tmz exposure (figure 3c). shrna-mediated sup-
pression of beclin 1 also signiﬁcantly increased the percen-
tage of cells undergoing micronucleation 5 days after tmz
exposure (figure 3d), without altering micronuclation in
untreated cells (not shown). because these data suggested
that autophagy was a means by which cells protect
themselves from multimicronucleation, and that the auto-
phagy and micronucleation processes might be mutually
exclusive, we also stably transfected u251 expressing
negative control shrna or shrna targeting beclin 1 with
constructs encoding gfp-lc3, after cells were incubated with
tmz (100 mm, 3 h). five days later, cells were incubated with
dapi
(to stain nuclei) and monitored by ﬂuorescence
microscopy for tmz-induced gfp-lc3 clustering (a marker
of autophagy) and multimicronucleation. as shown in
figure 3e, untreated cells expressing either the negative
control or beclin-targeted shrna exhibited a diffuse gfp
staining consistent with a lack of autophagy (left panels), and
no evidence of micronucleation (right panels). tmz treatment
of negative control cells or of cells expressing beclin shrna
led to the appearance of autophagic cells with a punctate gfp
appearance and of cells with characteristics of micronuclea-
tion (more autophagic cells and fewer micronucleated cells in
the negative control group)
in no
instance, however, did cells undergoing micronucleation
exhibit punctate gfp staining. these results suggest that
autophagy and micronucletion are,
to the limits of our
detection, mutually exclusive processes in tmz-treated
glioma cells.
(figure 3e, arrows).
finally, because multimicronucleation may not equate with
cell death, we also directly measured the effects of beclin
shrna on the clonagenicity of u251 cells exposed to tmz. as
shown in figure 4, the same beclin shrna that suppressed
beclin levels, suppressed the tmz-induced atp surge, and
enhanced tmz-induced micronucleation also enhanced
tmz-induced cytotoxicty. these data as a whole suggest
that tmz induced autophagy-driven increases in atp levels
protect cells from the drug-induced cell death preceded
multimicronucleation.

phosphorylation). inhibition of glycolysis with 2dg did not
block the tmz-induced two-fold surge in atp levels noted
5 or 7 days following tmz exposure (figure 5a). 2dg
incubation also neither enhanced the percentage of cells
undergoing multimicronucleation (not shown) nor altered the
extent of micronucleation in tmz-treated cells (figure 5b),
suggesting that
the atp surge that contributes to cell
protection was not generated by glucose uptake and
glycolysis. these
the
observation that tmz-treated cells also downregulated
glut-1, a major glucose transporter, in response to tmz
exposure (figure 5c). however, when the oxidative
phosphorylation in the mitochondria was blocked by
exposure of tmz-treated cells to a nontoxic, non-
micronucleation-inducing exposure of oligomycin (1 mm, not
shown), the tmz-induced atp surge was abolished and the
percentage of tmz-treated cells that died a multimicro-
nucleation-associated death was signiﬁcantly increased
(oligomycin groups, figures 5a and b). these results
suggest that the tmz-induced surge in atp production is
dependent not on glycolysis but on oxidative phosphorylation
of substrates that can be provided by autophagy.
consistent with
the tmz-induced atp surge is dependent on oxidative
phosphorylation. to determine whether the tmz-induced
atp elevation noted in gbm cells is dependent on catabolic
metabolism (mitochondrial atp production) as would be
expected in response to autophagy, we blocked either
anabolic metabolism (by inhibition of glycolysis) or catabolic
metabolism (by addition of a mitochondrial inhibitor) in tmz-
treated cells, and monitored atp levels and cellular
outcome. to do so, u251 cells were treated with tmz
(100 mm, 3 h) after which the cells were grown in drug-free
media for 3 days. the tmz-exposed cells were grown an
additional 2 days in glucose-free media containing 2-deoxy-
d-glucose (2dg, 10 mm) (to block glycolysis), or in glucose-
containing media supplemented with a mitochondrial f0, f1-
because the tmz-induced atp surge that was generated
by oxidative phosphorylation appeared to protect cells from
cell death preceded by multimicronucleation, we tested
whether providing exogenous substrates for oxidative phos-
phorylation to autophagy-deﬁcient cells could enhance atp
levels and suppress cell death preceded by multimicronuclea-
tion. for these studies, u251 cells retrovirally infected with
constructs encoding non-targeted shrna or an shrna
targeting beclin 1 were permeabilized with ﬁlipin i (5 mm) (a
sterol-binding agent that disrupts caveolae to permeabilize
the cell17), then incubated with pyruvate (0 or 25 mm) for 2
days beginning 3 days after tmz exposure (0 or 100 mm, 3 h),
after which atp levels and the percentage of cells undergoing
micronucleation were examined. as shown in figure 5d, atp

in contrast,
levels were not signiﬁcantly increased by permeabilization or
incubation of shneg control cells with pyruvate, although
consistent with data shown in figure 3c, tmz exposure
increased atp levels approximately three- to six-fold in the
absence or presence of pyruvate.
the tmz-
induced atp surge was suppressed in cells expressing
shbeclin (compare the third bar in each group in figure 5d) but
could be partially restored by providing pyruvate to the cells.
as would be predicted, the genetic suppression of beclin
levels also enhanced tmz-induced multimicronucleation, an
that could be reversed by provision of pyruvate
effect
(figure 5e). these results suggest
that tmz exposure
induces autophagy and enhances atp production, which in
turn helps protect from cell death preceded by multimicro-
nucleation.
to determine if our observations were unique to u251 cells,
we repeated studies in two other p53-mutant glioma cells,
u373 and sf188. like tmz-treated u251 cells, both tmz-
treated u373 and sf188 cells exhibited g2-m arrest at 3–5
days post-tmz exposure (figure 6a). the cells also exhibited
an lc3-ii accumulation at 4–5 days after tmz treatment,
which was inhibited by the delayed addition of 3-ma
(figure 6b). we also observed downregulation of
the
phosphorylation of s6k and progressive hypophosphorylation
of 4e-bp1 in both cell lines, consistent with downregulation of
mtor activity that accompanies autophagy (figure 6c). as
with u251 cells, analyses of atp levels revealed a signiﬁcant
tmz-induced elevation of atp production. the delayed
addition of 3-ma, while not altering atp levels itself (not
shown), did inhibit the tmz-induced surge in atp production
(figure 6d), suggesting the atp surge was associated with
autophagy. delayed 3-ma addition, while not altering micro-
nucleation by itself (not shown) also resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in tmz-induced multimicronucleation in both cell
cell death and differentiation

lines (figures 6d and e). these results support the idea that
tmz-induced, autophagy-driven, cytoprotective increases in
atp levels are not unique to u251 cells but are also observed
in other glioma cell lines such as u373 and sf188 cells.
etoposide induces an autophagy-associated atp
elevation. because it is known that autophagy is induced
by multiple dna damaging agents,3,8 we repeated studies in
u251 cells using etoposide to see whether the autophagy-
associated cytoprotective atp surge was unique to tmz. as
shown in figure 7a, etoposide (20 mm, 8 h) induced an s-
phase and g2-arrest in u251 cells. immunoblot analyses
revealed the accumulation of lc3-ii, which peaked 2 days
in support of

the
etoposide induction of autophagy, we also observed
downregulation of
the phosphorylation of s6k and
progressive hypophosphorylatation of 4e-bp1 indicative of
mtor activity downregulation (figure 7c). the analyses of
levels of atp revealed an etoposide-mediated elevation of
atp 3 days after the treatment (figure 7d) in a time course
consistent with the autophagic process, suggesting that this
atp surge was an autophagy-related process. delayed
addition of 3-ma to ﬁlipin-permeabilized cells (which did not
in itself alter atp levels or micronucleation – not shown) also
suppressed processing of map1-lc3 as well as the atp
elevation driven by etoposide exposure (figures 7e and d,

respectively), and signiﬁcantly increased the percentage of
cells eliminated by cell death preceded by multimicro-
nucleation (figures 7d and f). furthermore, as shown in
figure 7d, co-incubation with pyruvate (0 or 25 mm) and 3-
ma (24 h after starting the etoposide-treatment), neither of
which alone altered atp levels or micronucleation (not
shown) resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant elevation of levels
of atp (po0.01), which also partially reversed the enhanced
cell death mediated by the addition of 3-ma. similar results
were obtained using sf188 cells (figures 8a–e). these
results suggest that the autophagy-associated atp surge
that protects cells from drug-induced cell death is not unique
to tmz and can be reproduced by other dna damaging
agents such as etoposide.
discussion
the autophagic process has taken on increased importance
following the recognition that it represents a novel form of cell
it
remains unclear whether
death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis.2,3,18–20 the role of
drug-induced autophagy, however, is poorly understood, and
given the protective role of autophagy in times of cellular
starvation,
the drug-induced
autophagy noted following exposure of cells to agents such
as tmz is protective from, or contributory to, cell death.3,8 in
this study, we show that autophagy induced by two distinct
dna damaging agents clearly protects several gbm cell lines
from cell death preceded by multimicronucleation. further-
more,
this protection is associated with surges in atp
generated not by glycolysis but by oxidative phophorylation.
the data presented therefore suggest that part of the cellular
response to dna damaging agents such as tmz is the
autophagic enhancement of catabolic metabolism and atp
levels which in turn provide a degree of cellular protection that
may contribute to chemoresistance.
the present work ﬁrmly establishes a link between two
distinct processes: drug-induced autophagy and suppression
of cell death characterized by multimicronucleation. previous

work suggested that tmz exposure induced autophagy in
glioma cells and contributed to chemo-resistance, although
this study did not examine atp levels.13 in the same study,
however, it was also shown that inhibition of tmz-induced
autophagy by 3-ma modestly enhanced cell viability, rather
than suppressed it as noted in the present study. in the
present study we manipulated the autophagic process 3 days
after a brief tmz exposure (a time frame that coincides with
the completion of
the cell cycle arrest and the onset of
autophagy), rather than continuously during tmz exposure
and cell cycle arrest as in the previous study. this allowed us
to analyze the role of autophagy more precisely, and may
explain some of the differences noted between the studies.
the present work also deﬁnitively shows that the autopha-
gic increase in atp production was dependent on oxidative
phosphorylation following the induction of autophagy, and
was also linked to suppression of cell death characterized by
multimicronucleation. previously, it has been reported that
autophagy provides growth-factor deprived cells with oxidiz-
able substrates to compensate for the loss of nutrient uptake,
and allows cells to maintain atp production via catabolic
metabolism.15 the results of the present study are consistent
with those derived from growth factor-deprived cells, although
the source of substrates for the oxidative phosphorylation in
the present study can only be presumed to be autophago-
lysosome-processed catabolized cellular components. the
induction of autophagy following tmz or etoposide exposure
resulted in a surge of atp production rather than a sustained
elevation as noted following growth-factor deprivation,
although the surge in atp levels was larger than could be
induced by supplying exogenous substrates for oxidative
phosphorylation. even relatively small
increases in atp
levels, however,
led to signiﬁcant suppression of death
characterized by multimicronucleation, suggesting that atp
levels are intimately linked to micronucleation sensitivity.
although the nature of this linkage is not clear, atp plays a
role in cellular maintenance, maintenance of dna integrity,21
the cell cycle.22 the autophagy-
and the reinitiation of
associated surge in atp may therefore allow cells to maintain
normal function in the face of extensive dna damage. in this
sense, autophagy may serve a cooperative role with cell cycle
checkpoints in allowing the cell time to deal with dna damage.
given that tmz activates signaling pathways that control the
(including akt-mtor23) as well as the
g2 checkpoint
autophagic process, the linkage between dna damage and
the g2 checkpoint may also extend to autophagy. these
ideas remain to be examined.
the present work also suggests that drug-induced autop-
hagy and its resultant cytoprotective surge in atp levels may
resistance to chemo-
be a generalized mechanism of
therapeutic agents. the present study shows that
two
unrelated agents both induce autophagy, a surge in atp,
cell death and differentiation

and protection from one form of cell death. both tmz and
etoposide, however, are dna damaging compounds that
induced cell cycle arrest, and in this regard autophagy may be
a more speciﬁc response to compounds that generate
potentially lethal dna damage. consistent with this idea, the
ability of tmz to induce autophagy is not related to general-
ized cell stress, but rather to the generation of dna lesions
(o6-methylguanine) that lead to dna damage in the form of
dna single, and double strand breaks (kanzawa et al.14 and
unpublished data). the importance of autophagy may also
however vary by the genetic background of
the cells
examined. the present studies were limited to p53-mutant
glioma cells because in these cells the predominant form of
tmz-induced cell death is multinucleation rather
than
apoptosis or senescence.11,12 while most gbm are similarly
defective in the p53 pathway and presumably inﬂuenced by
autophagy, tumors of other genetic backgrounds may be less
inﬂuenced by the autophagic process. these issues remain to
be deﬁned.
the present study clearly shows that
the autophagic
process induced by tmz and etoposide can contribute to
resistance to these agents, suggesting that differences in the
ability of cells to activate this process may contribute to their
sensitivity to these drugs. modulation of
the autophagic
pathway may be a novel way of modifying resistance to
tmz, etoposide, and perhaps an even broader range of
chemotherapeutic agents, and as such warrants further
examination.
materials and methods
cell culture and reagents. human malignant glioma u251 and u373 cells
were purchased from atcc (american tissue culture collection, rockville, md,
usa). human malignant glioma sf188 cells were obtained from the ucsf brain
tumor research center tissue bank (san francisco, ca). all cells were grown in
dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. tmz was
supplied by the drug synthesis & chemistry branch, developmental therapeutics
program, division of cancer treatment and diagnosis, national cancer institute
and was dissolved in dimethyl sufoxide (dmso) (sigma, st louis, mo). etoposide,
3-ma, o6-benzylguanine (bg), oligomycin, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dg), filipin1 and
sodium pyruvate were from sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo). e-64d and
pepstatin were purchased from calbiochem. rapamycin was obtained from cell
signaling technology.
drug treatment. for studies examining the effect of tmz on u251 and u373
cells, unsynchronized, subconﬂuent cells were exposed to tmz (0 or 100 mm) for
3 h, after which the cells were washed, placed in tmz-free medium, and harvested
at appropriate time points. for experiments in sf188 cells, unsynchronized,
subconﬂuent cells were pretreated with 10 mm bg for 2 h to deplete mgmt,
followed by incubation with 100 mm tmz for 3 h in the presence of bg (10 mm), after
which the cells were washed, placed in bg (10mm) supplemented, tmz-free media,
and grown until harvest. for studies examining the effect of etoposide in u251 and
sf188 cells, the cells were exposed to 20 mm etoposide for 8 h, after which the cells
were washed, placed in etoposide-free medium, and harvested at time points of
interest. for all experiments, the cells were plated at least 24 h before the drug
treatment, and ﬁnal dmso concentration did not exceed 0.1% (v/v).
3-ma was dissolved directly into culture media, aliquoted and stored at  201
until used. in the studies using 3-ma, drug-free media was exchanged for media
containing 0–10 mm 3-ma beginning 2 days prior to harvest for tmz-treated cells,
and 1 day or 2 days prior to harvest for etoposide treated cells. 2-dg and oligomycin
were dissolved in water and 100% ethanol respectively, and in studies using these
agents, drug-free media was replaced with media containing 1 mm oligomycin or
with glucose-free media containing 10 mm 2-dg beginning 2 days prior to harvest.
sodium pyruvate and ﬁlipin1 were dissolved in water and 100% ethanol,
respectively, and in studies using these agents, sodium pyruvate and ﬁlipin1 were
added (25 mm and 5 mg/ml respectively) to drug-free media beginning 2 days prior to
harvest.
cell cycle studies. cell cycle analyses were done as previously described.11
brieﬂy, at each time point after the treatment, the cells attached to the culture dish
were trypsinized and collected. these cells were washed in pbs, ﬁxed in 70% (v/v)
ethanol, and stored at  201. the cells were washed once with pbs followed by
incubation in pbs containing 20 mg/ml propidium iodide (sigma chemical co.) and
100 mg/ml rnasea (sigma chemical co.) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.
stained nuclei were then analyzed using a becton dickinson facscan (san jose,
ca) with 20 000 events/determination. modfitlt software (verity software house,
inc., topsham, me) was used to assess cell cycle distribution.
immunoblot analyses. preparation of protein samples and western blot
were performed as described previously11 with minor modiﬁcations. whole-cell
lysate (0.5–5 mg) were electrophoresed and electroblotted onto an immobilon-p
membrane (millipore, bedford, ma). the membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk
(bio-rad laboratories)/tbst or 5% bsa (sigma)/tbst for an hour and probed
with antibodies to phosphorylated s6k (thr389), 4e-bp1 (cell signaling
technology, beverly, ma), glut-1 (chemicon, temecula, ca), beclin-1 (bd
pharmingen, beverly, ma) or a-tubulin (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca)
at 41c overnight. bound antibody was detected with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (cell signaling technology, beverly, ma
and santa cruz biotechnology) using enhanced chemiluminescence western
blotting detection reagents (pierce, rockford, il).
to assess the autophagic processing of map1-lc3, the cells were collected
separately from the samples above by a modiﬁed method as described previously.24
brieﬂy, 3 h prior to collection of the samples, e64d (10 mg/ml) and pepstatin a
(10 mg/ml) were added. after 3 h, the cells were washed with pbs, trypsinized, split
into equal halves, and centrifuged to obtain cellular pellets. one half was used to
determine protein concentration using protein assay reagent (bio-rad labora-
tories, hercules, ca) while the other half was lysed directly using lds sample buffer
to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 1ug/ul. protein aliquots (10 mg) were then
subjected to the immunoblot analysis and probed with antibodies to map1-lc3 (h-
50) or alpha-tubulin (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) at 41c overnight
with detection as described above.
measurement of atp content. atp levels were measured as described
previously.16 brieﬂy, control and drug-treated cells were trypsinized and collected,
counted in triplicate using a coulter z2 particle count and size analyzer (coulter
corporation, miami, fl), after which cells (2500–10 000 cells/50 ml) were placed in a
96-well plate, eight wells per sample. atp levels were measured by the luciferin-
luciferase method using an atp bioluminescence assay kit
(celltiter-glo
luminescent cell viability assay, promega, usa). a standard curve was
generated from known concentrations of atp for each experiment to reassure
the reproducibility of each experiment. each experiment was carried out at least in
triplicate.
measurement of multimicronucleated cells. for measurement of
multimicronucleated cells, cells were seeded on chamber slides (lab-tec i chamber
slide system, nalge nunc, rochester, ny) at least 24 h before exposure to tmz
(100 mm, 3 h) or etoposide (20 mm, 8 h). control cells and cells at each time point
after the indicated treatment were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.25% triton x-
100/pbs for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed with pbs, then stained with
hematoxylin/eosin. the cells that were large (absent of cytoplasmic shrinkage) and
contained separate micronuclei with evenly stained chromatin (absence of
chromatin condensation) were deﬁned as multinucleated cells as reported
previously.19,25,26 the percentage of multimicronucleated cells was determined
after scoring more than 100 nuclei for each experiment. each experiment was
repeated at least three times.
shrna constructs. psilencer negative control and psilencer (ambion, austin,
tx) were a gift from dr. yong-won kwon (university of california san francisco).
the sequence of the shrna targeting beclin-1 was that described in a previous
publication,27 and the shrna cassette was subcloned into the bamhi–hindiii site.
u251 cells were transfected by nucleofector transfection (amaxa, gaithersburg,
md) using program t-20. at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were selected by
supplementing dmem with puromycin (400 ng/ml) for 7 days to obtain a pooled
population of u251 cells stably expressing the shrna construct.

colony formation assay. colony formation assay was carried out as
previously reported.12 brieﬂy, on the day before tmz treatment, sf126 cells were
irradiated (40 gy) and plated in six-well plates at a density of 5 104 cells/well to
function as a feeder layer. on the day after, the cells treated with tmz (0–50 mm,
3 h) were trypsinized, counted, and plated at a concentration of 100 cells/well into
wells of six-well culture plates. 14 days after tmz exposure, cells were stained with
coumassie blue (biorad), and colonies of 450 cells were counted.
involvement of lc3. a green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp)-lc3 expression
vector was kindly supplied by dr. s kondo (university of texas md anderson
cancer center). u251 expressing a nontargeted shrna (shnegctrl) or an shrna
targeting beclin-1 (shbeclin) were transfected with gfp-lc3 using fugene (roche),
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. at 72 h after transfection, cells were
selected in medium containing 500 mg/ml of g418 (gibco) for 7days to obtain
stably gfp-lc3 expressing cells. those cells were treated with tmz as described
above.
