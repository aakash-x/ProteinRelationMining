summary
plant  innate  immunity  is  often  associated  with  spe-
cialized programmed cell death at or near the site of
pathogen  infection.  despite  the  isolation  of  several
lesion mimic mutants, the molecular mechanisms that
regulate  cell  death  during  an  immune  response
remain  obscure.  recently,  autophagy,  an  evolution-
arily conserved process of bulk protein and organelle
turnover, was shown to play an important role in lim-
iting  cell  death  initiated  during  plant  innate  immune
responses. consistent with its role in plants, several
studies in animals also demonstrate that the autoph-
agic machinery is involved in innate as well as adap-
tive immunities. here, we review the role of autophagy
in  plant  innate  immunity.  because  autophagy  is
observed in healthy and dying plant cells, we will also
examine  whether  autophagy  plays  a  protective  or  a
destructive role during an immune response.
introduction
for  a  cell  to  maintain  homeostasis,  there  needs  to  be
constant turnover of macromolecules to adjust to the cel-
lular changes necessitated by responses to the immediate
environment. in addition to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
of  speciﬁc  proteins,  bulk  degradation  of  proteins  and
organelles ensures a proper balance between anabolism
and catabolism. autophagy, a greek word meaning to ‘eat
oneself’, is needed for non-speciﬁc protein and organelle
turnover.  it  can  be  induced  by  multiple  stress  factors
including  cellular  damage,  lack  of  nutrients  or  pathogen
attack  (levine  and  klionsky,  2004).  there  are  different
types of autophagy, including biosynthetic autophagy as
seen  in  yeast  in  the  trafﬁcking  of  the  vacuolar  protein

aminopeptidase  during  cytoplasm-to-vacuole  transport
(cvt) and several degradative types including macroau-
tophagy (reviewed in klionsky, 2005). for this review we
will use autophagy to refer to bulk degradation mediated
by macroautophagy.
autophagy is visually characterized by the formation of
a double-membrane bound structure called the autopha-
gosome  (fig. 1).  autophagosomes  are  formed  from  the
expanding  isolation  membranes  of  the  preautophagoso-
mal  structure  (pas)  (klionsky,  2005).  the  isolation
membrane  is  speculated  to  be 
  synthesized
independent  of,  or  in  isolation  from,  other  membrane-
bound  organelles.  the  expanding  isolation  membrane
invaginates  and  sequesters  cytoplasmic  proteins  and
organelles, then joins end-to-end to seal the autophago-
some  (fig. 1).  the  outer  membrane  of  the  autophago-
some  fuses  to  the  lysosome/vacuole  with  subsequent
delivery of the inner vesicle or autophagic body into the
lumen for degradation (klionsky, 2005).

mation  and  for  proper  autophagic  activity  (levine  and
klionsky, 2004; klionsky, 2005). the atg proteins can be
grouped  into  ﬁve  functional  groups:  a  kinase  cascade
important for initiation of autophagy/cvt transport (fig. 1,
step  1),  a  protein  complex  needed  for  aminopeptidase
sequestration during cvt transport, a lipid signalling cas-
cade for vesicle nucleation (fig. 1, step 2), two ubiquitin-
like  protein  conjugation  pathways  important  for  vesicle
expansion  (fig. 1,  step  3),  and  a  recycling  cascade  for
disassembly of the atg protein complexes from matured
autophagosomes (fig. 1, step 4). readers are referred to
excellent  recent  reviews  for  details  about  the  individual
functional  groups  and  the  genes  within  each  group
(levine and klionsky, 2004; klionsky, 2005).
although  autophagosome-like  structures  were  ob-
served microscopically in plants more than 30 years ago
(matile and winkenbach, 1971), well before the sophisti-
cated  modern  studies  in  yeast  and  mammals,  the
molecular  machinery  and  regulation  of  autophagy  in
plants  remain  obscure.  with  the  recent  discoveries  that
autophagy is needed not only for starvation responses but
also  for  development,  ageing  and  immunity  (thompson

immunities (deretic, 2005; levine, 2005; liu 
plants mount various defence responses against invad-
ing  microbes  (soosaar 
.,  2005).  basal  defence
includes the perception of microbe-associated molecular
patterns at the cell surface to halt the entry of the patho-
gen  into  the  cell.  consequently,  microbes  have  evolved
the means to suppress basal defence by interfering with
defence  signalling. to  overcome  this  interference,  plants
have developed speciﬁc mechanisms referred to as innate
immunity. the most extensively studied plant innate immu-
nity involves recognition of pathogen-encoded avirulence
(avr) proteins by plant resistance (r) proteins. often this
r–avr  interaction  leads  to  the  hypersensitive  response
(hr), a form of pcd, at the site of pathogen infection. hr-
pcd is often observed as necrotic lesions and the patho-
gen  is  restricted  to  these  lesions  and  cells  immediately
surrounding  it. therefore,  it  is  thought  that  the  hr-pcd
functions  to  limit  the  spread  of  pathogen  from  infection
sites  into  adjacent  healthy  tissue  (lam,  2004).  although
hr-pcd is morphologically well characterized, the regu-
lators  that  are  involved  in  execution  and  termination  of
pcd are not well understood.

the hr-pcd initiated at the site of pathogen infection

mimic mutants (reviewed in lorrain

informative,  these  genes  have  not  uncovered  deﬁned
mechanisms that connect innate immunity and hr-pcd.

of  hr-pcd  and  restriction  of  virus  spread.  to  identify
genes that control n-mediated hr-pcd, liu et al. (2005)
performed  a  high  throughput  rnai  screen.  interestingly,
silencing  of  beclin  1  resulted  in  uncontrolled  hr-pcd
upon tmv infection (fig. 2). this phenotype is dependent
on  a  successful  innate  immune  response  because
beclin1-silenced plants infected with tmv failed to induce
death in the absence of n.
mammalian  beclin  1,  an  orthologue  of  yeast  atg6/
vps30  was  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  as  an  interactor  of  the  anti-
apoptotic  protein  bcl-2  (liang  et al.,  1998;  liang  et al.,
1999). beclin 1 is part of a class iii pi3k/vps34 complex
required for autophagosome formation and recruitment of
other  atg  proteins  into  pas  (kihara et al.,  2001).  inter-
estingly,  silencing  of  other  autophagy  genes  including
pi3k/vps34,  atg3  and  atg7  also  resulted  in  uncon-
trolled hr-pcd upon tmv infection (liu et al., 2005). the
requirement  of  beclin  1  and  other  autophagy  genes  to
limit  hr-pcd  to  the  infection  site  during  a  plant  innate
immune  response  indicates  that  autophagy  may  be
involved  in  this  processes.  consistent  with  this  notion,
plant beclin 1 can complement the yeast atg6 mutant. in
addition,  lysotracker  red  staining  and  electron  micros-
copy  data  showed  that  autophagy  is  induced  during  the
n-mediated response to tmv not only at the site of hr-
pcd  but  also  in  the  adjacent  healthy  tissue  (liu  et al.,
2005). however, in the beclin 1-silenced plants, the induc-
tion of autophagy was compromised upon tmv infection.
autophagy  is  not  only  required  to  limit  n-tmv  induced
hr-pcd  but  also  other  r–avr  interactions  and  general
elicitor  induced  hr-pcd.  this  suggests  that  autophagy
plays a central role in regulating hr-pcd that occurs in
plant immunity (liu et al., 2005).
unlike  the  lesion  mimic  mutants,  the  discovery  that
plant atg genes and autophagy regulates cell death pro-
vides a direct mechanistic connection to known regulators
of pcd. in mammals, beclin 1’s interaction with bcl-2 is
dispensable for initiation of both autophagy and apoptosis,
but  is  essential  for  controlling  the  extent  of  autophagic
activity. this prompted the hypothesis that bcl-2 is impor-
tant for maintaining a balance between cell death and cell
survival  (pattingre  et al.,  2005).  because  bcl-2  homo-
logues have not been uncovered in plants, this may sug-
gest  that  other  hr-pcd-associated  proteins  bridge  the
gap between cell death and autophagy in plants.
in  animals,  caspases  are  crucial  to  the  execution  of
pcd, however, to date, no homologues of caspases have
been  identiﬁed  in  plants.  it  has  been  hypothesized  that
proteases unrelated to caspases and small effector mol-
ecules  are  responsible  for  mediating  pcd  in  plants.
recently  the  vacuolar-processing  enzyme  (γvpe)  was
identiﬁed  as  a  cysteine  protease  essential  for  hr-pcd
induced during tmv infection (hatsugai et al., 2004). the
observation  that  vacuolar  trafﬁcking  is  needed  for  both
pcd and autophagy-mediated cell survival has led to the
speculation that both events may share common compo-

inactive  zymogens,  utilize  vesicles 
nents (seay and dinesh-kumar, 2005). the processing of
γvpe bears an uncanny striking resemblance to carbox-
ypeptidase y (cpy) processing in yeast, a process known
to utilize beclin 1/atg6 for vesicle formation. both γvpe
and cpy are enzymes that are translated in the cytoplasm
as 
for  vacuolar
transport and are further processed as well as activated
in the vacuole. in yeast, plant γvpe colocalizes with cpy
in  prevacuolar  endosome-like  compartments  (pvcs)
(kinoshita  et al.,  1999). γvpe  may  provide  a  pivotal  link
between autophagy and cell death in plants. the obvious
next questions would be to directly address if cvt path-
way exists in plants. is this pathway used for the process-
ing of γvpe?
even though the mechanism(s) that initiates pcd dur-
ing plant innate immunity is not well understood, the ﬁnd-
ings from liu et al. (2005) indicate that autophagy is not
required for execution of pcd, but rather it is required to
limit  pcd  to  the  infection  site.  these  results  imply  that
there is a ‘pro-death’ signal(s) moving out of the pathogen-
infected area into adjacent tissues that is negatively reg-
ulated by autophagy. it is currently unknown whether (i)
autophagy  alters  the  inducer  of  pro-pcd  signals,  (ii)
blocks the receptor of the pro-pcd signal or inhibits com-
ponents downstream of perception from responding to the
signal, or (iii) prevents the movement of pro-pcd signals
from a single infected cell into other cells or from the dying
cells within a lesion into surrounding uninfected tissues.
autophagy and viability: pro-survival or pro-death?
autophagic  structures  are  often  observed  in  dying  cells
during  pcd  in  other  eukaryotes  (bursch,  2001).  com-
pounding  the  intrigue  was  the  discovery  that  beclin  1
interacts with bcl-2, suggesting surprising novel crosstalk
between  two  potential  cell  death  pathways  (liang et al.,
1998). however, it is still unclear exactly if and how bcl-2
affects autophagy or how autophagy affects antiapoptotic
bcl-2  family  proteins.  two  opposing  hypotheses  have
emerged:  autophagy  assists  in  the  death  of  cells  or
autophagy protects the cell from death. recent evidence
suggests that both hypotheses may be correct depending
on the cell type, stimuli and developmental stage.
several  recent  ﬁndings  support  the  hypothesis  that
autophagy plays a crucial role in cell survival during pcd
(edinger and thompson, 2004; levine and yuan, 2005).
it is well established that autophagy promotes cell survival
during  nutrient  starvation  by  degrading  and  recycling
nutrients. autophagy may also indirectly promote cell sur-
vival by retarding or preventing apoptosis. preliminary evi-
dence to support this alternative model was shown (boya
et al., 2005). when autophagy is compromised genetically
or pharmacologically, hela cells die via an apoptotic path-
way. this death is abolished using bcl-2 or caspase inhib-
pcd regulation by autophagy 903
itors  suggesting  that  autophagy  prolongs  survival  by
deterring  the  onset  of  apoptosis.  in  c. elegans  when
orthologue of human beclin 1 is eliminated by rnai, cells
undergo  ced-3/caspase  dependent  ectopic  cell  death
suggesting  that  wild-type  bec-1,  which  functioned  in
autophagy, is also required to prevent ectopic apoptosis
(takacs-vellai et al.,  2005).  aside  from  affecting  apopto-
sis,  autophagy  also  plays  a  more  direct  role  in  cell  sur-
vival.  in  interleukin-3-dependent  bax/bak-/-  bone  marrow
cells  compromised  for  apoptotic  function,  autophagy  is
essential for cell survival after growth factor removal (lum
et al., 2005). this survival is characterized by an increase
in autophagosome formation and the catabolism of intra-
cellular  substrates  consistent  with  autophagic  function.
furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy, either by silenc-
ing of atg5/atg7 or by using inhibitors, leads to rapid cell
death.  similarly,  in  the  fungus  podospora  anserina,  the
initiation of pcd is not dependent on autophagy, however,
cell death is accelerated in temperature-sensitive mutants
of paatg1 and paatg8, indicating that autophagy is critical
for survival even in lower eukaryotes (pinan-lucarre et al.,
2005).
in  contrast  to  the  pro-survival  function  of  autophagy,
there are mounting data to suggest that autophagy itself
is a ‘pro-death’ process or results in cell death by regulat-
ing apoptosis (baehrecke, 2005; levine and yuan, 2005).
during drosophila development, autophagy is essential to
activate the pcd required to eliminate unwanted salivary
glands.  consistent  with  this  concept,  several drosophila
atg  genes  are  upregulated  in  dying  salivary  glands
(reviewed in baehrecke, 2005).
overexpression  of  bcl-2  or  bcl-xl  in  wild-type  mouse
embryonic ﬁbroblasts treated with etoposide, a common
apoptotic reagent, resulted in increased autophagosome
formation  (shimizu  et al.,  2004).  autophagy  mediated
death seems to depend on bcl-xl, because elimination of
bcl-xl  reduced  the  formation  of  autophagosomes  and
death. in addition, bax/bak-/- double-knockout mice lines
were  unable  to  induce  apoptosis,  yet  when  treated  with
etoposide, the cells were still able to die. it was speculated
that  autophagy  was  responsible  for  this  cell  death
because  an  increase  in  autophagosome  formation  was
correlated   with   cell   death.   the   non-apoptotic   death
was  dependent  on  functional  autophagic  mechanisms
because silencing of atg5/beclin 1 abolished death when
treated with etoposide. similarly, inhibition of apoptosis in
mouse  l929  ﬁbroblastic  cells  by  rnai  suppression  of
caspase-8 or using the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor
zvad induces accumulation of autophagosomes and non-
apoptotic  death  (yu  et al.,  2004).  chemical  inhibitors  of
autophagy as well as atg7/beclin 1 silencing inhibited the
zvad induced cell death. these data suggest that in the
absence of apoptosis, autophagy can actively contribute
to execution of cell death.

regulation of autophagy via apoptotic machinery?
some components of the autophagic and apoptotic path-
ways have been shown to interact. in addition to bcl2, the
antiapoptotic protein bcl-xl also interacts with beclin 1 in
mammals (shimizu et al., 2004). like mammalian beclin
1,  c. elegans  beclin-1  also  interacts  with  ced-9,  an
orthologue of bcl-2, to regulate cell death (takacs-vellai
et al., 2005). beclin 1 is not the only autophagic compo-
nent associated with apoptosis. atg5 has been shown to
interact in  vivo  in  hela  cells  as  well  as in  vitro  with  the
fas-associated  death  domain  (fadd)  protein  a  known
adapter  molecule  important  for  receptor-mediated  apop-
tosis  (pyo  et al.,  2005).  the  induction  of  ifn-γ-induced
autophagic cell death is abolished in fadd deﬁcient hela
cells.  taken  together,  these  data  suggest  that  the  bio-
chemical interactions between autophagic and apoptotic
components  correlate  with  the  crosstalk  identiﬁed  from
genetic and morphological studies. studying the mecha-
nisms that regulate and accomplish this crosstalk may be
pivotal to understanding cell survival and cell death and
their relationship.
whether  autophagy  functions  in  cell  survival  or  cell
death  may  depend  on  the  level  of  autophagy  induced
during  a  given  physiological  condition  (pattingre  et al.,
2005). bcl-2 inhibits the function of mammalian beclin 1
by  interaction  with  a  binding  domain  speculated  to  be
important for autophagy. the interaction with bcl-2 (i) dis-
rupts the formation of the essential beclin1/pi3k complex
important for autophagosome formation and (ii) prevents
the  complementation  of  atg6  yeast  mutant,  possibly  by
competitive binding. in nutrient-starved mcf7 breast car-
cinoma cells, the inability of bcl-2 to bind mutant beclin 1
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the number of autoph-
agosomes and cell death. because the mcf7 cell line is
defective  in  caspase-3,  it  was  speculated  that  the
increased death was due solely to the increase in autoph-
agy. interestingly, rnai of atg5 blocked cell death in the
beclin  1  mutants.  together,  these  results  imply  that
autophagy levels determine if autophagy is pro-survival or
pro-death in mammals.
autophagy as an antimicrobial defence mechanism
mounting  evidence  indicates  that  autophagy  plays  an
important role in the elimination of intracellular and extra-
cellular pathogens. overexpression of beclin 1 in neurons
using a sindbis virus expression vector reduced sindbis
virus  replication  (liang et al.,  1998).  in  addition,  in  cells
derived from beclin 1 or atg5 mutants, sindbis virus and
herpes simplex virus replicate to higher titres than in wild-
type  cells  (levine  and  yuan,  2005;  seay  et al.,  2005).
similarly,  the  plant  virus  tmv  accumulated  to  a  higher
level  in  beclin  1-silenced  plants  than  in  wild-type  plants
(liu  et al.,  2005). these  results  indicate  that  autophagy
functions  as  an  antiviral  defence  mechanism.  the
increase in virus accumulation in autophagy deﬁcient cells
suggests that atg proteins might target cellular factors or
pathways required for virus replication and spread.
in  animals,  recent  ﬁndings  indicate  that  autophagy  is
also used to combat against bacterial pathogens. autoph-
agy  induced  by  nutrient  starvation  or  by  treatment  with
rapamycin  actively  inhibits  the  survival  of  the  facultative
intracellular pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis (guti-
errez  et al.,  2004).  similarly,  autophagic  vesicles  effec-
tively engulf and destroy invading extracellular pathogens
such as group a streptococcus (gas) (nakagawa et al.,
2004).  autophagy-deﬁcient  atg5-/-  mutant  es  cells  are
incapable  of  eliminating  gas,  allowing  it  to  survive  and
proliferate (nakagawa et al., 2004). it seems some bacte-
ria  have  evolved  effective  counter-defence  strategies  to
subvert  autophagy  and  promote  successful  infection
(ogawa et al., 2005). for example, atg5 directly interacts
with  the  shigella  ﬂexneri-encoded  surface  protein  virg
and  targets  the  bacteria  for  degradation.  however,  the
shigella-encoded effector protein icsb interferes with this
recognition. mutant shigella lacking icsb are engulfed by
autophagosomes  and  targeted  for  degradation  (ogawa
et al., 2005). considering the observation that autophagy
is involved in the control of pcd activated during defence
against bacterial pathogens in plants (liu et al., 2005), it
would be interesting to investigate if autophagy is involved
in  the  elimination  of  bacterial  pathogens  in  plants.  also,
can effector proteins encoded by plant pathogenic bacte-
ria inhibit autophagy?
some  bacterial  and  viral  pathogens  have  evolved  to
utilize the autophagy machinery for replication or survival
inside the host cell (kirkegaard et al., 2004). autophago-
somal-like vesicles provide a replicative niche for a variety
of pathogens including legionella pneumophila, and bru-
cella  abortus  (reviewed  in  shintani  and  klionsky,  2004).
while  hiding  inside  autophagosomes,  these  pathogens
replicate  and  either  restricts  autophagosome  maturation
or delay fusion with the lysosome. the invasive pathogen
porphyromonas  gingivalis  even  stimulates  autophago-
some  formation  and  uses  them  to  enter  the  host  cells.
similarly,  poliovirus  and  mouse  hepatitis  virus  (mhv)
induce the formation of autophagosome-like double-mem-
brane vesicles (dmv) and use them as a replicative niche
(prentice et al., 2004; jackson et al., 2005). in atg5-/- es
cells infected with mhv, formation of dmv is inhibited and
replication of the virus is drastically reduced indicating that
autophagy  is  required  for  efﬁcient  replication  of  mhv
(prentice et al., 2004).
future perspectives

autophagy  for  cell  survival  during  plant  innate  immune
response  and  raises  number  of  interesting  questions.
first, what signals or components induce autophagy dur-
ing a pcd response in plants? what signals downregulate
autophagy? in yeast the atg1 kinase complex is involved
in the induction of autophagy. as there are four atg1-like
kinases in plants, it will be interesting to know if any or all
of the plant atg1-like kinases are functional homologues
of  yeast  atg1.  in  addition,  it  is  necessary  to  determine
upstream  components  that  activate  the  atg1  complex
during  plant  innate  immune  response.  second,  how  is
autophagy  induced  during  innate  immunity  protects
uninfected   cells?   identiﬁcation   and   characterization
of  suppressors  of  spreading  pcd  phenotype  in  beclin
1-silenced  plants  using  genetic  and  biochemical
approaches should provide insight into the role of autoph-
agy in pcd. third, is the pcd initiated during plant defence
autophagic? if so, then one can envision autophagy as a
process  that  leads  to  cell  death  when  the  damage  is
irreversible  and  conversely  it  promotes  cell  survival  in
healthy  uninfected  tissue.  cell  biological  studies  using
autophagy  markers  should  help  to  distinguish  between
these possibilities. finally, the question that remains unan-
swered  in  any  organism  is  whether  autophagy  in  dying
cells undergoing pcd is the cause of death or is in fact
an endeavour to prevent it? answers to these and other
questions  will  be  instrumental  in  elucidating  the  precise
role of autophagy in plant and animal innate immunity.
