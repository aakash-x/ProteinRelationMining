t arget of rapamycin (tor) is a central regulator of 
cellular and organismal growth in response to nutri-
ent  conditions.  in  a  genetic  screen  for  novel  tor 
 interactors in drosophila melanogaster, we have identi-
ﬁ ed  the  clathrin-uncoating  atpase  hsc70-4,  which  is  a 
key regulator of endocytosis. we present genetic evidence 
that tor signaling stimulates bulk endocytic uptake and 
inhibits the targeted endocytic degradation of the amino 
acid importer slimfast. thus, tor simultaneously down-
introduction
multicellular  organisms  must  modulate  cellular  growth  and 
proliferation  in  response  to  available  nutrients,  energy,  and 
growth factor signaling. the regulatory kinase target of rapamycin 
(tor) has emerged as a convergence point for the transduc-
tion of these signals into appropriate changes in cell metabolism 
and  growth.  tor  activity  is  stimulated  by  insulin-responsive 
phosphatidylinositol-3  kinase  (pi3k)/akt  signaling,  by  nutri-
ents  such  as  amino  acids,  and  by  high  cellular  energy  levels 
(for reviews see martin and hall, 2005; sarbassov et al., 2005a). 
in response to these signals, tor effects changes in a diverse 
number  of  downstream  processes,  including  transcription, 
translation, nutrient import, and autophagy, to achieve the align-
ment  of  cellular  energy  utilization  with  available  resources. 
 unsurprisingly, improper activation of tor signaling has been 
implicated in the development of cancers and hamartoma syn-
dromes and in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity 
(manning, 2004). for example, mutations in either component 
of  the  tsc1–tsc2  complex,  which  is  an  upstream  inhibitor 
of tor signaling, result in the formation of benign tumors in 
multiple tissues.

regulates aspects of endocytosis that inhibit growth and 
up-regulates potential growth-promoting functions of endo-
cytosis. in addition, we ﬁ nd that disruption of endocytosis 
leads  to  changes  in  tor  and  phosphatidylinositol-3 
kinase activity, affecting cell growth, autophagy, and ra-
pamycin  sensitivity.  our  data  indicate  that  endocytosis 
acts both as an effector function downstream of tor and 
as a physiologically relevant regulator of tor signaling.
although tor is known to affect a wide range of cellular 
processes, the relative contribution of these processes and how 
they  interact  to  result  in  a  directed  growth  response  remain 
poorly understood. components of the translational machinery 
are  well  established  downstream  effectors  of  tor  signaling 
(martin and hall, 2005). tor directly phosphorylates eukaryotic 
initiation factor-4e–binding protein (4e-bp) and ribosomal pro-
tein s6 kinase (s6k), thereby facilitating cap-dependent transla-
tion and ribosome biogenesis. although these effects on protein 
synthesis are likely to contribute substantially to cellular growth 
capacity, they are unlikely to fully account for the growth effects 
of tor.  for  example,  whereas  inactivation  of tor  results  in 
a nearly complete block of protein synthesis in yeast, this effect 
is more modest in mammalian cells, with an ⵑ15–50% decrease 
in  translation  rate  (jefferies  et  al.,  1994;  terada  et  al.,  1994). 
in drosophila melanogaster, null mutations in 4e-bp are with-
out effect on cell growth (junger et al., 2003), and the growth 
phenotype of s6k-null mutants is signifi cantly less severe than 
that of tor mutants (montagne et al., 1999; oldham et al., 2000; 
zhang et al., 2000). activation of s6k only partially overcomes 
the growth arrest of tor mutants in this system. recent genetic 
studies in mouse have also shown that the ribosomal substrate of 
s6k,  rps6,  does  not  appear  to  be  a  relevant  mediator  of  the 
growth effects of this pathway (pende et al., 2004).
these  observations  have  motivated  the  search  for  other 
effector pathways and cellular processes downstream of tor

that might contribute to its effects on cell growth. a growing 
number of studies of tor structure, function, and localization 
point  to  an  important  role  for  tor  signaling  in  controlling 
 vesicular traffi cking. biochemical studies in yeast have found 
that tor localizes to intracellular vesicles and cofractionates 
with endosomal markers (kunz et al., 2000; chen and kaiser, 
2003), which is consistent with a role in the endocytic compart-
ment.  in  addition,  tor  has  a  highly  conserved  function  as 
a regulator of autophagy, which is a process of cytoplasmic deg-
radation that involves the reorganization of intracellular mem-
branes into autophagic vesicles (noda and ohsumi, 1998; scott 
et al., 2004). finally, tor is structurally related to the class iii 
pi3k/vps34  family  of  lipid  kinases,  with  well  characterized 
roles in endocytosis. interestingly, recent studies have identifi ed 
a novel role for hvps34 in relaying intracellular nutrient status 
to tor (byfi eld et al., 2005; nobukuni et al., 2005), indicating 
that this family of molecules may have common roles in nutri-
ent sensing and membrane traffi cking.
we  report  the  identifi cation  of  the  clathrin-uncoating 
atpase  hsc70-4  in  a  genetic  enhancer/suppressor  screen  for 
novel tor interactors in d. melanogaster. hsc70-4 is a critical 
regulator  of  clathrin-mediated  endocytosis,  and  we  provide 
 evidence  that  tor  signaling  infl uences  bulk  endocytosis,  as 
well as the targeted endocytic degradation of a specifi c amino 
acid transporter. our results suggest that tor controls growth, 
in part, by simultaneously down-regulating aspects of endocy-
tosis  that  inhibit  growth  and  up-regulating  potential  growth-
promoting functions of endocytosis.
results
hsc70-4 mutants are dominant modiﬁ ers 
of tor overexpression phenotypes
to better understand the regulation and downstream effects of 
tor-mediated growth signaling, we took a genetic approach to 
reveal novel players in the tor signaling pathway. we used a 
tissue-specifi c tor overexpression phenotype as the sensitized 
background  for  a  dominant-modifi er  ethyl  methanesulfonate 
(ems) mutagenesis screen. to create this background, p element–
mediated  transposition  was  used  to  introduce  a  copy  of  the 
wild-type tor cdna, which was preceded by multiple copies 
of the eyeless (ey) enhancer, into the d. melanogaster genome. 
ey-driven overexpression of tor (eytor) led to an overall re-
duction in size of the adult eye (fig. 1, a–b), demonstrating the 
paradoxical  decrease  in  growth  previously  observed  to  result 
from  wild-type  tor  overexpression  (hennig  and  neufeld, 
2002).  in  addition  to  the  reduction  in  eye  size,  ommatidial 
 patterning  was  disorganized,  with  some  ommatidia  appearing 
fused  or  pitted.  immunohistochemistry  of eytor  imaginal 
discs revealed a delay in morphogenetic furrow progression and 
missing and disorganized photoreceptor cells, as well as an in-
creased level of cell death (fig. s1, available at http://www/jcb.
org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511140/dc1).  the  severity  of  the 
eytor  phenotype  was  strongly  enhanced  by  a  heterozygous-
null mutation of the negative tor regulator tsc1 (fig. 1 c) and 
was suppressed by addition of rapamycin to the media (fig. s1). 
these  results  suggest  that  the eytor  phenotype  results  from 
inappropriately high levels of tor signaling, and they demon-
strate the potential utility of this overexpression phenotype as 
a dosage-sensitive genetic background.
we  next  sought  to  identify  novel  factors  involved  in 
tor signaling by screening for the ability of ems-generated 
 mutations  to  dominantly  modify  the eytor  phenotype.  from 
ⵑ60,000 f1 progeny scored, we identifi ed 23 eytor enhancers 
and 2 suppressors. within this collection were two independent 
groups  that  failed  to  complement  for  lethality.  we  report  the 
analysis of a third chromosome complementation group consist-
ing of two alleles (e3 and e19) isolated as dominant enhancers 
of the  eytor phenotype. heterozygous mutation of either  e3 
or  e19  caused  a  further  reduction  in  eye  size  of  eytor  fl ies 
(fig. 1 d and fig. s1) and a similar enhancement of ms1096-
gal4-driven tor misexpression phenotypes in the adult wing 
(fig. s1). through recombination and defi ciency mapping we 
localized the e3 and e19 mutations to the 88e4 genomic region. 
complementation tests with lethal mutations in this interval re-
vealed that e3 and e19 disrupt the hsc70-4 gene, which encodes 
a constitutively expressed member of the stress-induced hsp70 
family  of  atpases.  independently  isolated  mutant  alleles  of 
hsc70-4  also  displayed  a  strong  enhancement  of  the  eytor 
phenotype  (fig.  s1).  in  addition,  both  the  dominant  eytor 
 enhancement and the recessive lethality of e3 and e19 could be 
rescued  by  a  transgene  carrying  a  wild-type  copy  of  hsc70-4 
(hing et al., 1999; fig. s1). we found that the e3 and e19 muta-
tions result in single amino acid substitutions within the atpase 
domain of hsc70-4 (ser40 to phe and arg301 to cys, respectively; 
fig.  1  g).  these  residues  are  completely  conserved  in  fungi, 
plant, and animal hsc70-4 orthologues, indicating their likely 
importance  for  hsc70-4  function.  therefore,  from  this  point 
forth we refer to these mutations as hsc70-4e3 and -4e19.
hsc70-4 catalyzes the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesi-
cles,  which  is  an  essential  late  step  in  clathrin-mediated 
 en docytosis  (schlossman  et  al.,  1984;  chang  et  al.,  2002). 
in  addition,  hsp70  family  members  can  act  as  chaperones 
to  regulate  protein  folding  and  stability  (mayer  and  bukau, 
2005).  to  determine  whether  either  of  these  functions  of 
hsc70-4 contributes to its genetic interactions with tor, we 
fi rst assayed the ability of other endocytic factors to modify 
tor  misexpression  phenotypes.  shibire  (shi)  encodes  the 
d. melanogaster homologue of dynamin, which is a gtpase 
critical for the proper membrane closure and budding of endo-
cytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (chen et al., 1991). 
we  found  that  expression  of  a  dominant-negative  form  of 
 shibire,  shik44a  (moline  et  al.,  1999),  strongly  enhanced  the 
eytor phenotype (fig. 1, e and f), suggesting that hsc70-4 
may infl uence tor signaling through its role in endocytosis. 
in contrast, hsc70-4 mutations did not lead to increased levels 
of tor protein in  eytor eye imaginal discs (fig. 1 h), indi-
cating  that  the  enhancement  of  the  eytor  phenotype  by 
hsc70-4 mutants is not caused by increased stability or abun-
dance of overexpressed tor protein. we also observed no in-
crease in total levels of endogenous tor protein in hsc70-4 
mutants (fig. 1 i). interestingly, we found that expression of 
shik44a led to increased localization of tor to vesicular struc-
tures, a subset of which were accessible to an endocytic tracer

tor signaling and endocytosis.
tor signaling promotes bulk endocytosis
to further characterize the interplay between tor and endocy-
tosis, we tested the effect of tor signaling on several endocytic 
markers in the d. melanogaster larval fat body. the fat body 
serves as a nutrient storage organ that is analogous to the verte-
brate liver (dean et al., 1985), and it has recently been shown 
to  act  as  a  nutrient  sensor  capable  of  affecting  global  growth 
through  a  tor-dependent  humoral  mechanism  (colombani 
et al., 2003). we tested the effects of altered nutrient availability 
and tor signaling on the intracellular localization of compo-
nents of the endocytic machinery, using gfp-fusions to rab5, 
rab7, and clathrin. in fat body cells from fed control animals, 
we observed gfp-rab5 localization both at the cell surface and 
throughout the cytoplasm (fig. 2 a).  in contrast, larvae sub-
jected to a 5-h starvation displayed a variable redistribution of 
gfp-rab5 toward the cell surface, with a less diffuse, punctate 
pattern  often  observed  in  these  cells  (fig.  2  b).  more  direct 
 alteration of tor signaling, through overexpression of tsc1 
and tsc2, or tor itself, also affected gfp-rab5 localization, 
resulting in the appearance of large aggregates near the cell sur-
face (fig. 2 c). the localization of gfp-rab7 and clathrin-gfp 
was  also  altered  in  response  to  tor  inhibition  (unpublished 
data).  overexpression  of  tor  in  fat  body  cells  also  resulted 
in  increased  expression  of  hsc70-4,  as  monitored  by  a  gfp-
hsc70-4 fusion expressed from the endogenous hsc70-4 locus 
(clyne et al., 2003). together, these data indicate that altered 
tor signaling effects an endocytic response in the fat body.
to better understand the nature of these endocytic changes, 
we monitored the effects of tor signaling on the ability of fat 
tor regulates endocytosis to effect cell growth • hennig et al.

body  cells  to  internalize  a  fl uorescent  endocytic  tracer, texas 
red–conjugated  avidin  (tr-avidin).  in  control  experiments 
we found that genetic disruption of shi or hsc70-4 prevented 
proper  endocytic  uptake  in  these  cells,  as  was  demonstrated 
 previously  in  garland  cells  (kosaka  and  ikeda,  1983;  chang 
et al., 2002). tr-avidin failed to be effi ciently internalized in 
shik44a-expressing fat body cells, and instead accumulated near 
the cell surface, often in large aggregates (fig. 2 e). tr-avidin 
uptake was also blocked in cells that were homozygous for a null 
allele of hsc70-4 (bronk et al., 2001), and, in this case, a decrease in 
both surface-bound and internalized tracer was observed (fig. 2 f).
a similar, but less extensive, decrease in tr-avidin uptake was 
observed in hsc70-4e3 and -4e19 mutant cells (fig. s2, available 
at http://www/jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511140/dc1).
we next used this assay to monitor the effects of altered 
tor signaling on bulk endocytic uptake. mosaic clones mutant 
for  a  null  allele  of tor   showed  a  nearly  complete  block  of 
tr-avidin  uptake  (fig.  2  g).  similar  effects  were  observed 
when tor signaling was inhibited by overexpression of tsc1–
tsc2  or tor  (fig.  s2). to  see  whether  increased  activation 
of  tor  could  further  stimulate  endocytic  internalization,  we 
generated  mitotic  clones  homozygous  for  a  tsc1-null  allele. 
 increased tracer uptake was observed in these cells (fig. 2 h). 
overexpression  of  rheb,  which  is  an  upstream  activator  of 
tor, caused a similar increase in tr-avidin uptake (fig. s2). 
we also tested whether two targets of tor, s6k and 4e-bp, 
 affected  endocytosis.  cells  mutant  for  a  null  allele  of  s6k 
showed a strong decrease in tr-avidin uptake, suggesting that 
the   effects  of  tor  on  endocytosis  are  mediated  in  large  part 
through s6k (fig. 2 i). in contrast, overexpression of 4e-bp, whose 
activity is inhibited by tor, had no effect in this assay (fig. 2 j).
as  an  alternative  approach  to  monitoring  endocytosis 
in vivo, we tested the ability of fat body cells to internalize larval 
serum  protein  2  (lsp2).  lsp2  is  present  in  the  hemolymph

 during larval development, and is internalized through endocy-
tosis by the fat body during the late third instar period (levenbook, 
1985). anti-lsp2 staining revealed a fi ne punctate appearance 
throughout the cytoplasm of wild-type cells (fig. 3). in contrast, 
shik44a-expressing  cells  displayed  large  aggregates  of  lsp2 
 protein at the cell surface and an absence of internal lsp2 staining 
(fig.  3 a).  hsc70-4  mutant  cells  were  also  defective  in  lsp2 
uptake,  and,  again,  differed  from  shik44a-expressing  cells  in 
showing a decrease in lsp2, both internally and at the surface 
(fig. 3 b). the effects of tor signaling on lsp2 internalization 
were identical to the effects on tr-avidin; lsp2 uptake was se-
verely reduced in tor or s6k mutant cells and in tsc1–tsc2–
overexpressing cells, and was increased in cells mutant for tsc1 
or overexpressing rheb (fig. 3, c–e, and fig. s2). together, 
these results demonstrate that the rheb–tor–s6k pathway is 
required for proper endocytic uptake and indicate a novel role for 
tor signaling in the positive stimulation of bulk endocytosis. 
furthermore,  they  indicate  that  shik44a  expression  and  loss  of 
hsc70-4 result in distinct endocytic phenotypes in the fat body.
tor signaling inhibits the endocytic 
degradation of slimfast
in addition to the nonselective endocytic uptake described in the 
previous section, studies in yeast and cultured mammalian cells 
have  shown  that tor  can  selectively  infl uence  the  endocytic 
uptake and degradation of specifi c nutrient transporters (beck 
et al., 1999; edinger and thompson, 2002). to investigate the 
effects of tor signaling on targeted endocytosis, we generated 
an antibody to slimfast, which is a cationic amino acid importer 
previously shown to positively affect organismal growth through 
effects on the tor and pi3k signaling pathways (colombani 
et al., 2003). we used this antibody to test whether tor signal-
ing may regulate the endocytic turnover of slimfast in response 
to  nutrient  conditions.  antibody  staining  of  fat  body  tissue 
 confi rmed that slimfast is localized primarily to the cell surface, 
with  peak  levels  just  below  the  plasma  membrane  (fig.  4 
and  fig.  s3,  available  at  http://www/jcb.org/cgi/content/full/
jcb.200511140/dc1). disruption of endocytosis through shik44a 
expression resulted in a marked increase in slimfast at the cell 
surface  (fig.  4 a),  suggesting  that  endocytosis  normally  acts 
to  antagonize  the  surface  expression  of  slimfast.  in  contrast, 
 disruption of hsc70-4 did not lead to increased surface levels 
of  slimfast  (fig.  4,  b  and  c),  which  is  consistent  with 
the  distinct effects of shik44a and hsc70-4 mutants on bulk 
 endocytic uptake.
we next asked whether changes in tor signaling affect 
slimfast levels. activation of tor through clonal overexpres-
sion of rheb caused an increase in surface levels of slimfast, 
which was similar to the effects of shik44a (fig. 4 d). the rela-
tive effect of rheb on slimfast levels was especially pronounced 
in larvae subjected to a 24-h starvation (fig. s3). under these 
conditions, tor activity is reduced in wild-type cells, but main-
tained  in  rheb-overexpressing  cells  (saucedo  et  al.,  2003). 
to  test  whether  slimfast  up-regulation  is  simply  caused  by 
 increased  protein  synthesis  in  rheb-overexpressing  cells,  we 
added the translation inhibitor cycloheximide during the 24-h 
starvation period. under these conditions, rheb overexpression 
still led to a modest relative increase in slimfast levels (fig. s3), 
which  was  consistent  with  a  partial  posttranslational  effect. 
 reduction in tor signaling also had a marked effect on slim-
fast staining, as overexpression of tsc1–tsc2 led to a decrease 
in slimfast levels (fig. 4 e). thus, the localization and levels 
of  slimfast  are  sensitive  to  tor  activity,  with  high  levels  of 
tor signaling resulting in accumulation of slimfast near the 
cell  surface, and decreased tor signaling leading to slimfast 
down-regulation.
we  next  sought  to  determine  whether  tor  signaling 
might mediate these changes in slimfast levels through effects 
on the targeted endocytosis of this importer. we tested whether 
the  slimfast  down-regulation  that  results  from  tsc1–tsc2

overexpression  requires  endocytosis  by  cooverexpressing 
tsc1–tsc2 and shik44a. in the absence of functional endocy-
tosis,  tsc1–tsc2  overexpression  no  longer  led  to  slimfast 
down-regulation.  instead,  slimfast  protein  appeared  to  be 
trapped in large aggregates near the surface of these cells (fig. 
4  f).  similar  results  were  observed  when  tor  activity  was 
 inhibited through starvation. in well fed larvae, partial disrup-
tion  of  endocytosis  through  expression  of  dominant-negative 
rab5s43n had little effect on slimfast levels (fig. 4 g). in con-
trast, rab5s43n expression led to a marked persistence of slim-
fast  at  the  plasma  membrane  in  starved  larvae  (fig.  4  h). 
collectively, these results demonstrate that endocytosis is criti-
cal for slimfast down-regulation in response to reduced tor 
signaling, resulting either from poor nutrient conditions or inac-
tivation by the tsc1–tsc2 complex.
to further investigate whether the endocytic down-regula-
tion  of  slimfast  is  a  specifi c,  targeted  process,  we  examined 
the  effects  of  altering  components  of  the  endocytic  sorting/ 
targeting machinery on slimfast levels. hrs (hepatocyte growth 
factor–regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is an early endosome–
associated, ubiquitin-binding protein that is critical for proper 
endocytic sorting. as shown in fig. 4 i, homozygous mutation 
of hrs led to a marked increase in slimfast levels near the cell 
surface. expression of a dominant-negative version of nedd4, 
which is an e3 ubiquitin ligase, similarly caused persistence of 
slimfast near the cell periphery (fig. 4 j). monoubiquitination 
by the nedd4 family of enzymes is critical for the initial target-
ing of plasma membrane–localized proteins to clathrin-coated 
pits  for  internalization  (rotin  et  al.,  2000).  together,  these 
 results demonstrate that components of the endocytic targeting/
sorting machinery are critical in mediating slimfast turnover.
endocytosis affects cell growth
our observations indicate that tor signaling affects both bulk 
and targeted endocytosis. interestingly, we note that tor ap-
pears to exert opposing effects on these processes, stimulating 
bulk endocytosis (figs. 2 and 3) and inhibiting the targeted en-
docytic degradation of slimfast (fig. 4). to test whether tor’s 
effects on endocytosis might contribute to its role in promoting 
cell growth, we assayed the growth properties of cells in which 
endocytosis was disrupted. flow cytometric analysis of mosaic 
wing imaginal discs revealed an increased cell size and  increased 
g2 population in hsc70-4e3 and -4∆16 mutant cells, relative to 
wild-type cells (fig. 5, b and c).  these effects were acutely 
dosage-sensitive,  as  hsc70-4  heterozygous  cells  were  also 
larger  than  wild  type  (fig  s4).  expression  of  shik44a  or  of 
a dominant-negative hsc70-4k71s transgene also resulted in in-
creased cell size (fig. 5, e and f). this cytometric profi le of in-
creased cell size and g2 content is similar to that of mutations

in negative regulators of tor such as tsc1, tsc2, and pten 
(gao et al., 2000; gao and pan, 2001), and to that of cells over-
expressing rheb (saucedo et al., 2003).
disruption  of  endocytosis  also  led  to  dosage-dependent 
cell size changes in the fat body. expression of shik44a caused 
a 1.5-fold increase in fat body cell size (fig. 5, i and j), which 
is consistent with its growth effects in wing disc cells. in con-
trast, cells homozygous for mutant alleles of hsc70-4 showed 
either a slight (e3) or a threefold decrease in cell size (∆16 null; 
fig. 5, g, h, and j). given that shik44a expression and hsc70-4 
mutation result in a similar block of endocytic uptake, but show 
distinct  effects  on  slimfast  expression,  these  results  suggest  
that the relative contributions to growth of bulk and transporter-
 mediated nutrient uptake may differ between imaginal disc and 
fat body cells.
together,  the  fi nding  that  endocytosis  is  both  regulated 
by tor and has effects on cell growth indicates that endocy-
tosis functions as a downstream effector of tor signaling. tor 
 simultaneously  down-regulates  aspects  of  endocytosis  that 
 inhibit growth and up-regulates potential growth-promoting 
functions of endocytosis.
endocytosis affects tor signaling
in addition to acting downstream of tor, the potential role 
of endocytosis in controlling nutrient import suggested that 
it  might  also  function  upstream  to  regulate  tor  activity, 
which  is  stimulated  by  nutrients  in  general  and  slimfast 
in parti cular (colombani et al., 2003). endocytosis has also 
been  shown  to  affect  the  levels  and  activity  of  the  insulin 
 receptor (ceresa et al., 1998), which may function upstream 
of  tor  by  activating  pi3k  signaling  (inoki  et  al.,  2002). 
 indeed,  we  observed  an  increase  in  insulin  receptor  levels 
similar  to  that  of  slimfast  in  response  to  rheb  overexpres-
sion (fig. s3). therefore, we examined the effects of endocy-
tosis on in vivo markers of pi3k and tor activity. to test 
whether endocytosis infl uences pi3k signaling, we analyzed 
the  effects  of  shik44a  expression  on  the  transcription  factor 
foxo,  which  is  excluded  from  the  nucleus  in  response 
to  pi3k-dependent  phosphorylation  (brunet  et  al.,  1999). 
clonal  expression  of  shik44a  in  fat  body  cells  resulted  in 
 relocalization  of  foxo  from  the  nucleus  to  the  cytoplasm 
(fig. 6 a), refl ecting increased pi3k activity and, thus, indi-
cating that endocytosis normally exerts a negative effect on 
pi3k signaling in these cells. 
as  a  cellular  readout  of  tor  signaling,  we  monitored 
the effects of endocytosis on autophagy, which is a process of 
cytoplasmic  degradation  that  is  inhibited  by  tor  (noda  and 
ohsumi,  1998;  scott  et  al.,  2004).  disruption  of  endocytosis 
through  expression  of  shik44a  prevented  proper  induction  of 
 autophagy after starvation (fig. 6 b), which is indicative of high 
levels of tor signaling in these cells. a similar inhibition of 
autophagy  was  observed  in  hsc70-4-null  cells  and  in  cells

to assess the effects of endocytosis on the kinase activity 
of tor, we monitored the levels and the phosphorylation status 
of known tor substrates. inactivation of d. melanogaster tor 
through  mutation  or  starvation  has  previously  been  shown  to 
cause a decrease in s6k phosphorylation at thr398, as well as 
an increase in s6k protein levels, through an unknown mecha-
nism (oldham et al., 2000; gao et al., 2002). more recently akt 
(ser505) has been identifi ed as a substrate for tor in associa-
tion with its cofactor rictor (sarbassov et al., 2005b). accord-
ingly, in control experiments we found that tsc129 homozygous 
larvae showed a decrease in total s6k levels and a slight de-
crease in thr398 phosphorylation relative to wild-type controls 
(fig. 6 c); normalized for s6k levels, thr398 phosphorylation 
was  increased  as  expected.  tsc129  mutant  larvae  also  showed 
a strong loss of akt-ser505 phosphorylation, which is consis-
tent with recent studies showing that the tsc1–tsc2 complex 
promotes  tor–rictor  signaling  to  akt  (yang  et  al.,  2006). 
we next examined these markers in extracts from hsc70-4e3/e19 
transheterozygous mutants, which are viable through the third 
instar larval stage. similar to tsc129 mutants, hsc70-4e3/e19 larvae 
showed a decrease in overall s6k levels and a reduction in s6k 
and akt phosphorylation; in this case, thr398 phosphorylation 
relative  to  s6k  abundance  was  reduced  compared  with  wild 
type (fig. 6 c).
the  similarity  between  hsc70-4  and  tsc1  mutants  was 
further  underscored  through  chemical  and  genetic  interaction 
studies.  imaginal  disc  cells  doubly  mutant  for  hsc70-4e3  and 
tsc129 showed a synergistic increase in cell size as compared 
with their single mutant counterparts (fig. 6 d). similarly,  using 
the ey-flp system to generate homozygous mutant eye tissue, 
we  observed  an  exacerbation  of  tsc129-induced  tissue  over-
growth  in  the  presence  of  hsc70-4e3  mutation,  in  some  cases 
 resulting in a marked outgrowth of tissue in the anterior portion 
of  the  retina  (fig.  6  e).  we  also  tested  whether  mutation  of 
hsc70-4 affects sensitivity to rapamycin, which inhibits tor 
signaling through the formation of an inhibitory binding com-
plex with the intracellular protein fkbp12 (brown et al., 1994; 
sabatini et al., 1994). growth of wild-type d. melanogaster is 
delayed on media containing rapamycin, and this delay is sensi-
tive to the dosage of tor pathway genes (zhang et al., 2000; 
patel et al., 2003). we found that heterozygous hsc70-4e3 muta-
tion signifi cantly alleviated the rapamycin-induced delay (fig. 
6 f), which is consistent with increased levels of tor signal-
ing. collectively, the cellular, biochemical, and genetic effects 
of endocytosis are consistent with this process playing a signifi -
cant role in cell growth and tor signaling.
discussion
inactivation  of  tor  causes  an  inhibition  of  cellular  growth, 
a reduction in cell size, and a suppression of cell cycle progres-
sion. in addition to well described changes in protein synthesis 
and  ribosome  biogenesis,  recent  studies  have  suggested  that 
other  cell  processes  are  likely  to  contribute  to  these  growth

inverse regulation of bulk endocytosis 
and targeted endocytic degradation. (a) under 
conditions favorable for growth, tor promotes 
bulk endocytic uptake and  inhibits the endocytic 
turnover  of  speciﬁ c  nutrient  importers  such  as 
slimfast. (b) in growth- inhibitory conditions, inac-
tivation of tor leads to a decrease in bulk endo-
cytosis and an increase in the targeted endocytic 
degradation of excess nutrient importers. (c) to-
gether, the opposing actions of tor on bulk and 
targeted endocytosis serve to facilitate nutrient 
import, providing energy and building blocks 
necessary for biosynthetic growth and leading 
to a further stimulation of tor signaling.
 effects of tor. the present study identifi es endocytosis as one 
such process. our results demonstrate that the clathrin-uncoating 
atpase hsc70-4 interacts genetically with tor and tsc1, and 
that bulk endocytosis is stimulated in cells with activated tor 
signaling.  conversely,  we  fi nd  that  tor  activity  inhibits  the 
endocytic degradation of nutrient transporters such as slimfast. 
together, these endocytic effects of tor promote both the bulk 
and targeted uptake of nutrients and other biomolecules  required 
for cell mass increase (fig. 7). in addition to this direct role in 
cellular  biosynthesis  and  growth,  nutrients  also  act  as  potent 
regulators of tor signaling. indeed, slimfast was previously 
identifi ed as an upstream activator of tor (colombani et al., 
2003). our fi ndings that disruption of endocytosis effects cell 
size, rapamycin sensitivity, and tor kinase activity are consis-
tent with an additional role for endocytosis upstream of tor.
mutations that disrupt endocytosis are likely to have both 
positive and negative effects on nutrient uptake and cell growth 
because they inhibit bulk endocytic uptake, as well as degrada-
tion of nutrient transporters and other signaling molecules. thus, 
the overall effects of endocytic disruption on nutrient uptake, cell 
growth, and tor signaling are diffi cult to predict a priori. our 
results suggest that both the cellular context and the specifi c step 
at which endocytosis is blocked infl uence the growth  response. 
thus, in fat body cells, expression of shik44a resulted in an in-
crease  in  cell  size,  whereas  loss  of  hsc70-4  function  caused 
reduced cell size. we note that these changes mirror the effects 
of  these  mutations  on  slimfast  levels;  whereas  both  shik44a 
 expression and hsc70-4 mutation decreased bulk endocytic up-
take, only shik44a resulted in increased levels of slimfast. in con-
trast, both shik44a and hsc70-4 mutants led to the increased size 
of  wing  imaginal  disc  cells,  suggesting  that  in  these  cells  the 
growth-inhibitory effects of endocytic degradation of membrane 
proteins such as slimfast predominate over the potential positive 
effects of increased bulk uptake. similarly, our results indicate 
a complex effect of endocytosis on tor signaling. partial reduc-
tion in hsc70-4 levels lead to an increase in tor signaling, as 
was evident in the eytor interaction and  rapamycin resistance. 
in  contrast,  larvae  that  are  homozygous  mutant  for  hsc70-4 
show a decrease in tor kinase activity. these results suggest 
that modest inhibition of endocytosis may increase tor signal-
ing, whereas a complete block of endocytosis may reduce it.
a striking parallel to the inverse regulation of bulk and tar-
geted endocytic processes by tor can be observed in its  effects 
on autophagy in yeast. through autophagy, random portions of 
cytoplasm are nonselectively engulfed within double membrane–
bound vesicles for delivery to the lysosome. activation of tor 
causes  this  nonselective  form  of  autophagy  to  be  suppressed, 
and,  instead,  the  autophagic  machinery  engages  in  a  selective 
type  of  autophagy  known  as  the  cytoplasm–vacuole  targeting 
(cvt) pathway, which is responsible for lysosomal delivery of 
specifi c hydrolases (klionsky and emr, 2000). thus, tor acts 
as a switch between selective and nonselective autophagy. tor 
may also be involved in switching between clathrin-and caveolae/
raft-mediated endocytosis in higher eukaryotes. a genome-wide 
survey  of  protein  kinases  found  that  rnai-mediated  inactiva-
tion of tor in hela cells inhibited clathrin-dependent processes 
such as transferrin uptake and vesicular stomatitis virus infection, 
and stimulated cavelolae/raft-dependent events (pelkmans et al., 
2005). together, these fi ndings suggest that tor may control the 
specifi city of membrane traffi cking components. in addition, our 
results show that s6k, which is an important tor substrate, acts 
downstream of tor in promoting bulk endocytosis, but is not 
involved in the suppression of starvation-induced autophagy.
the  identifi cation  of  endocytosis  as  a  tor-controlled 
function adds to the growing list of cell processes regulated by 
tor,  including  protein  synthesis,  ribosome  biogenesis,  auto-
phagy, metabolic gene expression, and cytoskeletal organization. 
how these distinct functions interact to achieve a coordinated 
growth response is only beginning to be understood. one likely 
mechanism involves the common use of molecular components 
and cellular substrates by different cell functions, as in the case 
of selective and nonselective autophagy, bulk endocytosis, and 
endocytic degradation. two or more distinct branches of tor 
signaling may also act cooperatively to control the same target, 
as  in  the  case  of  slimfast  regulation  by  both  translation  and 
 endocytosis, or may act in opposition, as previously observed 
for the role of s6k in limiting autophagy. finally, distinct tor 
complexes  may  converge  on  the  same  targets  with  opposing 
 effects, as in the regulation of akt by tor-raptor versus tor–
rictor complexes (shah et al., 2004; sarbassov et al., 2005b). 
the fi nding that tor signaling regulates the levels of slimfast, 
which was previously shown to function upstream of tor, adds 
another layer of complexity to the tor signaling network.

9.3-kb xbai–pspomi fragment and cloned into the transformation vector 
pcasper4 digested with xbai and noti. p element–mediated transposi-
tion was used to introduce the eytor transgene into yw ﬂ ies by standard 
methods. cyo and tm3 balancers carrying eytor insertion lines were 
created through transposase-mediated mobilization of an x chromosome 
eytor insert.
mutagenesis, mapping, and sequencing
mutagenesis. yw males isogenized for the second and third chromosomes 
were starved for 2 h before being fed a solution of 25 mm ems in 0.01 m 
tris, ph 7.5, and 1% sucrose overnight. batches of 50 mutagenized males 
were then mated to 50 cyo-eytor/sp virgins. crosses were reared in 
bottles at 25°c, being transferred once daily for 4 d before adults were 
discarded. f1 progeny were screened for the dominant enhancement or 
suppression of the eytor small eye phenotype. flies carrying ems-induced 
eytor-modifying mutations were back crossed to cyo-eytor and tm3-
eytor stocks, allowing mutations to be recovered and mapped to chromo-
some through segregation of the eytor interaction phenotype against the 
second and third chromosome markers.
mapping. e3 and e19 were localized to map position 57 centi-
morgans on the third chromosome by genetic recombination, and this 
region  was  further  reﬁ ned  to  the  87e8-88e6  interval  by  deﬁ ciency 
mapping. in complementation tests against available lethal mutations 
in this region, e3 failed to complement multiple p element-, ems-, and 
x-ray–induced mutations in hsc70-4. e19 showed complete failure to 
complement  e3  and  hsc70-454.1,  which  is  an  antimorphic  allele  of 
hsc70-4,  and  partial  complementation  with  other  hsc70-4  alleles. 
based on this pattern of complementation and on the strength of eytor 
interactions, we classify e3 as an antimorph and e19 as a hypomorphic 
allele of hsc70-4.
sequencing  e3  and  e19  mutations.  genomic  dna  was  isolated 
from e3 and e19 homozygous mutant larvae, and the second exon of 
hsc70-4 (containing the coding region) was pcr ampliﬁ ed using the primers 
c c a t t t t c t c a g t a t t a c t t c t c c t c t g g c  and g a g a a c t g t t a c t g t a t g-
g t t g c a t t g a g g  and sequenced using the primers c g a g a a a a g g a a-

overexpression and loss-of-function clones in d. melanogaster 
fat body tissue
gain-of-function clones. clonal transgene expression was achieved using 
the gal4-uas system. act>cd2>gal4, uas-gfp or act>cd2>gal4, 
uas-myrrfp virgins were crossed to males carrying hs-flp and uas-driven 
transgenes of interest. flp-mediated excision of the cd2 insert is induced 
spontaneously in ⵑ10% of fat body cells at 25°c, leading to act5c-driven 
constitutive gal4 expression in gfp- or myrrfp-marked single cells or small 
clones (britton et al., 2002). gfp-rab5 expressing cells were generated 
as above but in the absence of uas-gfp.
loss-of-function  fat  body  clones.  hs-flp/frt–mediated  mitotic 
 recombination  was  induced  in  0–8  h  embryos,  before  initiation  of 
 endoreplication  in  fat  body  tissue,  through  a  2  h,  37°c  heat  shock  in 
an air incubator. for uniform gfp marker expression, the fat body drivers 
cg-gal4 or fb-gal4 were used to activate uas-gfp lines on frt-bearing 
chromosomes.  loss-of-function  clones  were  marked  by  the  absence 
of gfp.

histology
fixation. third instar larvae were dissected in pbs, inverted, and  transferred to 
1.5-ml tubes containing 3.7% formaldehyde in pbst (pbs + 0.1% tween 20) 
for 4-h (imaginal discs) or overnight (fat body) ﬁ xation at 4°c, with gentle 
agitation. fix was removed through four 5-min washes in pbst.
antibody staining. fixed carcasses were blocked for 2–4 h in  pbstg 
(pbst + 5% normal goat serum) before incubation in pbstg + primary 
antibody at 4°c overnight. carcasses were washed four times for 20 min 
in  pbst  and  blocked  in  pbstg  for  1–2  h  before  incubation  in  pbst  + 
 secondary antibody + 1 μm hoechst 33258 at 4°c overnight. carcasses 
were rinsed in pbst four times for 20 min. tissue was dissected in pbs and 
mounted in fluoroguard reagent (bio-rad laboratories).
antibodies.  anti-slimfast  (1:400  dilution  of  rabbit  polyclonal  sera 
raised against a bacterially produced fusion between gst and the cooh-
terminal  cytoplasmic  tail  of  slif  [amino  acids  554–604]),  anti-foxo 
#3015 (1:300; gift from o. puig, university of california, berkeley, berke-
ley, ca), anti-flag m5 (1:500; sigma-aldrich), anti-elav 9f8a9 (1:50; 
developmental studies hybridoma bank), anti b-gal (1:500; calbiochem), 
anti inr 386 (1:2,000; gift from r. fernandez, new york university medi-
cal center, new york, ny), anti-lsp2 (1:500; gift from h. benes, university 
of arkansas, little rock, ar).
phalloidin staining. carcasses were dissected, ﬁ xed, washed, and 
blocked for 2–4 h in pbstg, before being incubated at 4°c overnight in 
0.165 μm alexa fluor 568 phalloidin (invitrogen) in pbstg containing 
1  μm  hoechst  33258.  carcasses  were  rinsed  in  pbst  four  times  for 
20 min before ﬁ nal dissection, mounting, and imaging.
live tissue staining. lysotracker staining was performed as in scott 
et al. (2004). for acridine orange staining, dissected eye discs were incu-
bated in pbs containing 1 μm acridine orange for 5 min at room temperature. 
tissue was rinsed in pbs, transferred to a drop of pbs on a microscope 
slide, and covered loosely with a coverslip for imaging.
endocytic uptake assay
5–10 larvae per genotype were bisected and inverted in pbs, and then 
transferred to a 1.5-ml tube containing 80  μg/ml tr-avidin (invitrogen) 
in  m3  insect  medium  (sigma-aldrich)  containing  5%  fetal  calf  serum, 
1× insect medium supplement (sigma-aldrich) and penicillin/streptomycin 
antibiotics  (invitrogen).  carcasses  were  incubated  for  15  min  at  room 
 temperature with gentle agitation, rinsed two times and washed three times 
for 5 min with ice-cold pbs + 0.5% bsa at 4°c, and then ﬁ xed, washed, 
and mounted in fluoroguard reagent.
microscopy
confocal  images  were  acquired  on  a  microscope  (axioplan  2;  carl 
zeiss  microimaging,  inc.)  equipped  with  a  digital  camera  (orca-er; 
hamamatsu) and a spinning disc confocal system (carv; bd biosciences). 
axiovision  v3.1  acquisition  software,  plan-apochromat  63×,  1.40  na, 
and plan-neoﬂ uar 40×, 0.75 na, objectives were also used (all from carl 
zeiss microimaging, inc.). all other images were taken with a digital camera 
(dxm1200; nikon) attached to an epiﬂ uorescence microscope (axio-
scope 2; carl zeiss microimaging, inc; act-1 acquisition software [nikon], 
plan-neoﬂ uar 40×, 0.75 na, 20×, 0.50 na, and 5×, 0.15 na, objec-
tives were also used) or a digital camera (coolpix 990; nikon) attached 
to a dissecting microscope (stemi 200c; carl zeiss microimaging, inc.). 
all images were processed in photoshop v7.0 (adobe).
scanning electron microscopy. whole ﬂ ies were passed through an 
ethanol series to achieve hydration in 100% etoh. flies were then dehy-
drated using a critical point dryer (model 780a; tousimis), mounted on 
carbon  tape,  and  gold  sputter–coated  using  a  high  vacuum  deposition 
system  (dv-502a;  denton).  eyes  were  imaged  using  a  field  emission 
gun  scanning  electron  microscope  (s-4700;  hitachi;  fe-pc  sem  v3.3 
control software, v2.10 operating software) and transferred to pci v4.2 
(quartz) for processing.
western blotting
larvae were transferred to fresh medium supplemented with yeast paste 
and allowed to feed for 24 h before extraction. extracts were prepared 
by homogenizing equal masses of wild-type or mutant larvae directly in 
1× sds sample buffer. extracts were boiled, run on an 8% sds-polyacryl-
amide gel, and transferred to pvdf membrane using the mini protean 3 
electrophoresis and wet transfer system (bio-rad laboratories). membranes 
were  blocked  in  pbst  containing  5%  dry  milk  for  4  h  before  overnight 
 incubation in primary antibody. primary antibodies were diluted in pbst 
containing 5% bsa. the primary antibodies used were as follows: akt, 
p-ser505-dakt,  p-thr398-ds6k  (1:1,000;  cell  signaling  technology), 
published june 19, 2006
ds6k  (1:1,000,  mouse  monoclonal;  gift  from  g.  thomas,  university  of 
cincinnati,  cincinnati,  oh),  dtor  (1:1,000;  gift  from  d.  pan,  johns 
 hopkins university, baltimore, md), tubulin dmia (1:5,000; calbiochem). 
membranes were washed four times for 20 min in pbst and blocked 
for  1  h  before  4  h  incubation  in  hrp-conjugated  secondary  antibody. 
membranes were washed four times for 20 min in pbst. supersignal ecl 
 substrate solutions (pierce) were applied to membranes to allow protein 
detection on biomax light ﬁ lm (kodak).
flow cytometry
mitotic loss-of-function clones were induced at 3.5 d after laying through 
a 2-h heat-shock in a 37°c air incubator, and were allowed to grow for 
45  h  postinduction  at  room  temperature.  overexpression  clones  were 
 induced at 3.5 d after laying through a 1 h 15-min heat-shock, and were 
allowed to grow for 48 h at 25°c. approximately 25 wing imaginal discs 
per genotype were dissected and processed for facs analysis, essentially 
as previously described (neufeld et al., 1998). in brief, discs were added 
to 250 μl of pbs in 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes, and kept on ice 
until  275  μl  trypsin  solution  (9×  trypsin-edta  [sigma-aldrich],  1×  pbs, 
and 2 μm hoechst 33342) was added to each tube to allow tissue dissocia-
tion  into  single  cells.  samples  were  mixed  on  a  nutator  (clay  adams) 
at room temperature for a minimum of 2 h before ﬂ ow cytometric analysis 
 using a facsaria (bd biosciences). flowjo v4.4 was used for data analysis.
