heterotrimeric g proteins of the gi class have been implicated in
signaling pathways regulating growth and metabolism under
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. knockout mice
carrying inactivating mutations in both of the widely expressed g␣i
class genes, g␣i2 and g␣i3, demonstrate shared as well as gene-
speciﬁc functions. the presence of a single active allele of g␣i3 is
sufﬁcient for embryonic development, whereas at least one allele
of g␣i2 is required for extrauterine life. mice lacking both g␣i2 and
g␣i3 are massively growth-retarded and die in utero. we have used
biochemical and cell biological methods together with in situ liver
perfusion experiments to study g␣i isoform-speciﬁc functions in
g␣i2- and g␣i3-deﬁcient mice. the subcellular localization of g␣i3 in
isolated mouse hepatocytes depends on the cellular metabolic
status. g␣i3 localizes to autophagosomes upon starvation-induced
autophagy and distributes to the plasma membrane upon insulin
stimulation. analysis of autophagic proteolysis in perfused mouse
livers showed that mice lacking g␣i3 are deﬁcient in the inhibitory
action of insulin. these data indicate that g␣i3 is crucial for the
antiautophagic action of insulin and suggest an as-yet-unrecog-
nized function for g␣i3 on autophagosomal membranes.

pertussis toxin-sensitive g proteins
h eterotrimeric g proteins functionally couple seven-
transmembrane cell-surface receptors to a variety of intra-
cellular effector systems, including enzymes and ion channels.
the heterotrimeric g protein ␣-subunits are encoded by 16
genes in humans and mice, and ⬎20 distinct g␣protein isoforms
have been identified (1). the gi family of ␣-subunits comprises
three closely related members, g␣i1–g␣i3, and originally was
named for its ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. g
proteins of the gi class are characterized by their sensitivity to
pertussis toxin (ptx). the g␣i1–g␣i3 isoforms share 85–95% of
amino acid sequence identity and partially overlapping expres-
sion patterns. although g␣i1 primarily is found in the nervous
system, g␣i2 is expressed ubiquitously and represents the quan-
titatively predominant g␣i isoform. g␣i3, the closest homolog of
g␣i1, is hardly detectable in the neuronal system but is broadly
expressed in peripheral tissues.
targeted loss-of-function mutations in mice have been pro-
duced for all g␣i isoforms and have provided information about
shared as well as gene-specific biological roles. the loss of g␣i1
results in defects of long-term memory (2). g␣i2-deficient mice
develop an inflammatory bowel disease with characteristics of
ulcerative colitis (3). a gene-specific role of g␣i2 also has been
described in the inflammatory response of alveolar macrophages
(4). furthermore, the disruption of the g␣i2 locus leads to
increased peri- and postnatal mortality of unclear origin. in
contrast, mice constitutively deficient in either g␣i1 or g␣i3 are
viable and fertile. the initial analysis of g␣i3-deficient mice did
not reveal overt phenotypic defects (5, 6). however, the com-
parative analysis of g␣i1/g␣i3-double-deficient with g␣i2-
deficient mice led to the identification of overlapping as well as
isoforms in the antiinfectious
gene-specific functions of gi
response of macrophages and splenocytes (7). recent studies of
g␣i3 mutant mice have revealed craniofacial and other skeletal
deformities consistent with a specific requirement for g␣i3 in the
cranial neural crest and in somites (n. w. plummer, k.s., j.
malphurs, l.b., unpublished work).
in addition to their established functions for signal transduc-
tion across the plasma membrane, heterotrimeric g protein
␣-subunits localize to intracellular membranes and have been
implicated in membrane trafficking and fusion events along the
secretory and endocytic pathways, such as vesicle formation by
the endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi/secretory pathway, and
vesicle trafficking and fusion (8–11). in particular, g␣i3 has been
localized to golgi membranes in renal and pancreatic cells (12,
13) and to the endocytic compartment in kidney proximal tubule
epithelium (14) and in rat hepatocytes (15). studies in the colon
carcinoma cell line ht-29 furthermore have suggested a role for
g␣i3 in macroautophagy (16).
macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a
ubiquitous membrane-trafficking mechanism that sequesters
cytoplasmic material for targeted delivery to lysosomes, where
the material is degraded and subsequently recycled (17, 18). in
contrast to the selective degradation of generally short-lived
proteins through the proteasomal degradation pathway, auto-
phagy constitutes the major cellular pathway for the bulk deg-
radation of long-lived proteins and the turnover of organelles.
constitutive autophagy plays an essential role for the mainte-
nance of homeostasis by removing misfolded proteins or dam-
aged organelles. upon short-term starvation, the initiation of
autophagy functions as a temporary survival mechanism by
providing an alternative energy source. however, unrestrained
autophagy results in cell death (19). defects in autophagy

perturb development, and the deregulation of autophagy has
been proposed to play a role in diseases including cancer,
neurodegenerative disorders, cardiomyopathy, and muscular
diseases (18, 20).
a number of evolutionarily conserved proteins essential for
autophagy have been identified, and their molecular and bio-
logical functions are beginning to be elucidated (21–25). nev-
ertheless, little is known currently about the signal transduction
pathways that couple extra- or intracellular stimuli to the mo-
lecular machinery of autophagosome formation and maturation.
the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor)
plays a central role for the transmission of autophagic stimuli.
amino acids alone or in combination with insulin or other
growth factors can stimulate the activity of mtor, leading to an
inhibition of autophagy, but tor-independent pathways of insulin
signaling also have been described in the rat liver (26–28). although
it has been suggested that g proteins such as g␣i3 may be
implicated in the control of autophagic sequestration in a colon
carcinoma cell line (16, 17), supporting in vivo evidence is lacking.
here, we have used biochemical and cell biological methods
together with in situ liver perfusion experiments in g␣i2- and
g␣i3-deficient mice to study the biological functions of gi class
g proteins. our findings show that g␣i3 specifically is required
for the insulin-mediated regulation of autophagy and suggest a
previously unrecognized function for g␣i3 on autophagosomal
membranes.
results and discussion
to distinguish gene-specific functions of the two peripheral g␣i
isoforms, g␣i2 and g␣i3, from shared biological roles in vivo, we
have intercrossed mice homo- or heterozygously deficient in
g␣i2 and/or g␣i3 and analyzed the g␣i2- and g␣i3-deficient
progeny. although g␣i2-deficient mice were born at less than the
expected frequency, and animal numbers were reduced by
⬇50% at weaning age, i.e., postnatal day 21 (p21) (3), mice
mutant for g␣i3 were born at the predicted mendelian ratio
[supporting information (si) tables 1–4]. g␣i2/g␣i3 double-
deficiency resulted in massive growth retardation and embryonic
lethality before embryonic day 10 (e10). the presence of one
⫹/⫺ embryos was sufficient for
allele of g␣i3 in g␣i2
development and survival up to birth, but animals died perina-
tally (see si table 4). the presence of a single allele of g␣i2 in
⫺/⫺ mice maintained survival up to the neonatal
g␣i2
period, but postnatal survival was reduced. representative
images of selected g␣i2/g␣i3 mutant embryos at e9 or e10 are
shown in si fig. 6. thus, the presence of a single active allele of
g␣i3 is sufficient for embryonic development, whereas one allele
of g␣i2 is required for extrauterine life. these data not only
indicate overlapping roles of g␣i2 and g␣i3 but also suggest the
existence of gene-specific functions.

to test the idea of functional compensation at the protein
level, we have analyzed the expression of g␣i2 and g␣i3 in
membrane preparations obtained from mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (mefs) or organs of wild-type (wt), g␣i2-deficient, and
g␣i3-deficient mice. in the absence of g␣i2, steady-state protein
levels of g␣i3 were markedly increased compared with wt levels.
in contrast, the depletion of g␣i3 did not significantly trigger an
up-regulation of g␣i2 protein levels (fig. 1a). these data suggest
that increased levels of g␣i3 may compensate for g␣i2 functions
in the case of g␣i2 depletion, whereas wt g␣i2 levels may be
sufficient to substitute for g␣i3 functions in a g␣i3-depleted
system. in all investigated wt cells and tissues from peripheral
organs, including liver, g␣i2 was the predominant g␣i isoform
(fig. 1 a and b and data not shown). we also have performed
[32p]adp ribosylation experiments with ptx to test the func-
tional expression of g␣i2 and g␣i3 in these mice (fig. 1c).

g␣i2 in whole-liver membranes, the amount of ptx-modified

⫺/⫺ mice were

analyzed by immunoblotting with a g␣common antibody. equal loading was
conﬁrmed by a nonspeciﬁc protein stain with ponceau s. the depletion of g␣i2
induces an up-regulation of the steady-state protein levels of g␣i3, whereas
g␣i2 levels remain virtually unchanged in the absence of g␣i3. (b) liver cell
membranes from wt and g␣i3 mutant mice were analyzed for gi isoform
expression as described above. (c) cell membranes from liver, thymus, or
spleen were subjected to a ptx-catalyzed adp ribosylation in the presence of
[32p]nad⫹. shown are representative autoradiographs. the extent of g␣i3
adp ribosylation is highest in liver. n ⫽ 3 for all experiments.
g␣i3 was comparable to ptx-modified g␣i2. in contrast, the
quantity of [32p]adp-ribosylated g␣i2/g␣i3 in thymus or spleen
was proportional to the relative protein levels of g␣i2 and g␣i3.
to investigate the function of g␣i3 in liver, we have generated
a g␣i3-specific antibody. in its affinity-purified form, this g␣i3
antibody specifically recognized g␣i3 species of the appropriate
apparent molecular weight in whole-cell
lysates of primary
hepatocytes or mefs of wt and g␣i2-deficient, but not g␣i3-
deficient, mice (fig. 2a). the g␣i3 antibody stained cultured
primary hepatocytes from wt and g␣i2-deficient mice but failed
to stain hepatocytes from g␣i3-deficient mice (fig. 2b). we
conclude that the g␣i3 antibody specifically detects g␣i3 but not
g␣i2 by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.
g␣i3 localizes to golgi membranes and endosomes in different
tissues, including liver (14), and has been involved in the control
of autophagic sequestration and intracellular trafficking events
in the colon carcinoma cell line ht-29 (16, 17). membranes
derived from the golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum
have been implicated in the biogenesis of autophagosomal
vesicles, and endosomes and lysosomes fuse with autophagic
vesicles during their maturation to a lytic compartment (17). to
determine the potential role for g␣i3 in autophagy in liver, we
first investigated the g␣i3 subcellular localization pattern. to
induce autophagy, hepatocytes were subjected to a short-term
amino acid starvation and growth factor starvation. ubiquitin-
like light-chain protein 3 (lc3) was used as a specific marker for
the autophagosomal compartment (29). lc3 exists in a cytosolic
form (lc3-i) and in a membrane-associated, phospholipid-
conjugated form (lc3-ii). the induction of autophagy leads to
the processing of lc3-i to lc3-ii and its subsequent targeting
to preautophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes (30).
initially, we ascertained the suitability of a goat polyclonal
lc3 antibody for immunocytochemistry in hepatocytes because
this antibody does not recognize endogenous or overexpressed
lc3 in western blotting experiments (data not shown). in

ences cited therein). (b) primary mouse hepatocytes from wt, g␣i2-deﬁcient, or

fig. 3.
mary mouse hepatocytes were kept in culture medium (resting) or subjected
to amino acid and growth factor withdrawal (starved). to inhibit autophagy,
cells were treated with insulin (10 nm for 60 min) or with phenylalanine (0.2
mm for 60 min). the inhibition of autophagy is characterized by the disap-
pearance of lc3-positive autophagosomes, paralleled by a loss of g␣i3 from
the vesicular compartment and the scattering of lysosomes. insulin induces an
accumulation of g␣i3 in the plasma membrane, whereas phenylalanine leads
to a diffuse cytosolic distribution of g␣i3. note the characteristic membrane
rufﬂing response to insulin and the marked ﬂattening of cells in response to
phenylalanine. images are confocal micrographs. n ⫽ 3 for all experiments.
contrast, a widely used rabbit polyclonal anti-lc3 antibody is
able to detect endogenous or overexpressed lc3 by immuno-
cytochemistry as well as in western blotting experiments, but
cannot be used together with the rabbit polyclonal anti-g␣i3
antibody because of cross-reactivity in the secondary detection
step. to this end, we first transfected primary mouse hepatocytes
with gfp-lc3 and stained for lc3. gfp-lc3 localized to
cup-like or ring-like structures typical of autophagosomes, and
the same structures were detected by the goat polyclonal lc3
antibody (si fig. 7a). second, we validated the goat polyclonal
lc3 antibody by comparing it to a widely used rabbit polyclonal
lc3 antibody. both antibodies recognized the same intracellular
structures (si fig. 7b). we conclude that the goat polyclonal lc3
antibody is able to reliably detect autophagic vacuoles in cells.
starvation-induced autophagy triggered a redistribution of
g␣i3. in the absence of autophagy, g␣i3 predominantly was
found diffusely distributed in the cytosol (see fig. 2b). in
contrast, cells undergoing starvation-induced autophagy were
characterized by a local accumulation of g␣i3 on the plasma
membrane as well as on lc3-positive autophagosomes and
lysosomes (si fig. 8). the association of g␣i3 with membranes
of autophagic vacuoles was corroborated biochemically by sub-
cellular fractionation of isolated hepatocytes (si fig. 9). g␣i3
also distributed to the endoplasmic reticulum and to endosomes
upon induction of autophagy (si fig. 10). these compartments
are required for the biogenesis of autophagosomes (17, 31) and
for the maturation of autophagosomes to lytic organelles (17). in
particular, a g␣i3-based mechanism has been hypothesized to
control the flux of membranes originating from different vacu-
olar compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, to form
a preautophagosomal structure (31). thus, g␣i3 is targeted to
subcellular compartments with known functions in autophagy.
starvation-induced autophagy is counteracted by hormones,
such as insulin, and by nutrients (e.g., amino acids). we therefore
tested whether the subcellular localization of g␣i3 is controlled
by physiological regulators of autophagy. fig. 3 shows that the
exposure of starved hepatocytes to insulin or phenylalanine led
to the disappearance of the vesicular staining of lc3-ii, indi-
cating that autophagy was suppressed efficiently. together with
the loss of lc3-positive autophagosomes, the vesicular staining
of g␣i3 disappeared. instead, insulin induced an accumulation of
g␣i3 at the plasma membrane. treatment of cells with phenyl-
alanine also resulted in the loss of autophagosomes and an
accompanying disappearance of vesicular g␣i3 staining. phenyl-
alanine treatment caused a marked flattening of the cells and a
diffuse cytosolic distribution of g␣i3, similar to resting cells.
autophagosomal vesicles mature into a catabolic compart-
ment upon fusion with lysosomes to form autolysosomes (17).
provided that the activity of lysosomal proteases is inhibited by
the addition of cell-permeable protease inhibitors, autolyso-
somes can be visualized with markers for autophagosomal and
lysosomal vesicles. in hepatocytes undergoing autophagy (fig. 3,
starved cells) the staining for lc3 and g␣i3 largely overlapped
with the lysosomal compartment. these data indicate that, under
our experimental conditions, most lc3-positive vesicles already
have fused with lysosomes and demonstrate that g␣i3 also can be
detected on autolysosomes. together, these data show that the
subcellular localization of g␣i3 depends on the cellular meta-
bolic status and suggest a previously unknown function for g␣i3
on autophagosomal membranes.
to test the relevance of these findings for autophagy in vivo,
we have performed in situ perfusion experiments in mouse livers.

sion with insulin (35 nm for 60 min) inhibits the insulin response. (b) the in situ
liver perfusion with phenylalanine (2 mm for 30 min) reversibly inhibits
autophagic proteolysis. pretreatment with ptx (100 ng/ml for 60 min) pre-

of added amino acids (32). the system has been used widely to
analyze the regulation of hepatic autophagy in rats (28).
fig. 4a shows that insulin reversibly inhibited the starvation-
induced autophagic proteolysis in wt mouse livers by ⬇20–25%,
comparable to the effect of the hormone in the rat liver (28, 32).
insulin suppresses autophagy to a physiologically maximal ex-
tent, even in the absence of added amino acids (17). to test the
involvement of gi proteins in this process, livers were preper-
fused with ptx. ptx markedly diminished the antiautophagic
action of insulin (fig. 4a). hepatocytes predominantly express
insulin receptors, whereas nonparenchymal liver cells such as
kupffer cells express type i insulin-like growth factor receptors
(33). together, these data suggest a role for gi proteins down-
stream of insulin receptor signaling.
high concentrations of amino acids alone are known to trigger
a maximal inhibition of autophagy, even in the absence of insulin
(17). fig. 4b shows that phenylalanine reversibly inhibited
autophagic proteolysis in wt mouse livers by ⬇25%, which is
comparable to the effects of insulin. likewise, ptx largely
abolished the antiautophagic action of phenylalanine.
we observed no significant additional antiautophagic effect of
insulin in the presence of maximally effective levels of phenyl-
alanine in four independent experiments compared with insulin

with ptx (100 ng/ml for 60 min). statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by paired
student’s t tests.
maximally after ⬇20 min, the effect of phenylalanine was
half-maximal after 5–10 min (see fig. 4). the time course of the
inhibition of autophagic proteolysis upon addition of insulin plus
phenylalanine was consistent with the combination of a faster
and a slower inhibitory phase (data not shown).
the insulin- and amino acid-dependent regulation of autoph-
agy appears to be mediated by distinct signal transduction
mechanisms that may converge on mtor (17, 26, 28). so far, no
other signaling components have been identified that are shared
by both pathways. our data show that the antiautophagic action
of insulin and phenylalanine can be blocked by ptx, indicating
that gi proteins are crucial for both signal transduction pathways
(fig. 4). however, neither insulin nor amino acids are known to
activate g protein-dependent signal transduction. we have
demonstrated a localization of g␣i3 to autophagosomal endo-
membranes that is reversible upon addition of insulin and
phenylalanine (see figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that g␣i3 may
function downstream of both insulin- and phenylalanine-
mediated regulation of autophagy.
to examine the role of g␣i3 in the insulin- and phenylalanine-
mediated regulation in vivo, and to directly compare the poten-
tial contribution of g␣i2 and g␣i3, we have analyzed autophagic

proteolysis in perfused livers of g␣i2- or g␣i3-deficient mice. fig.
5a shows that the inhibitory action of insulin was lost almost
completely in the absence of g␣i3, comparable to the effect of
ptx (see fig. 4a). in contrast, the insulin response was not
detectably impaired in the absence of g␣i2, the predominant g␣i
isoform in hepatocytes (see fig. 1). the loss of g␣i2 or g␣i3 in
the respective knockout mice was confirmed by adp ribosyla-
tion (fig. 5a inset). furthermore, the antiautophagic action of
phenylalanine was lost in the absence of g␣i3, as shown in fig.
5b together with a statistical evaluation of the described liver
perfusion experiments.
in summary, our data clearly demonstrate an obligatory
requirement for g␣i3 in the antiautophagic action of insulin and
phenylalanine and suggest an essential function for g␣i3 on
autophagosomal membranes. to date, no specific g protein-
coupled receptors or effectors have been identified on intracel-
lular membranes, and it is unclear whether the classical g
protein-coupled receptor/g protein/effector paradigm applies
on intracellular membrane compartments. nevertheless, g␣i3 is
known to be regulated intracellularly by the guanine nucleotide
dissociation inhibitor gaip-1 and by the regulator of g protein
signaling ags3, which have been involved in the control of early
events in autophagy (17). future work will be directed toward
elucidating the upstream regulation and specific cellular func-
tions of g␣i3 on autophagosomes. it remains to be demonstrated
whether g␣i3 is involved in the regulation of autophagy under
physiological and pathological conditions in the development of
embryos and in adults.

mm hepes, 150 mm nacl, 1% nonidet p-40, 1% sds, and 1%
triton x-100 (ph 7.4). one complete edta-free inhibitor
tablet (roche, penzberg, germany) was added per 100 ml of
buffer. proteins (30–50 ␮g per lane) were separated on 6 m
urea/sds/page gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. the anti-
g␣common antibody (as 8; ref. 35) was diluted 1:150, the anti-
g␣i3 antibody was diluted 1:5,000, and the anti-lc3 antibody was
diluted 1:750.
cellular autophagy and microscopic observation. cumulative cel-
lular autophagy was induced by amino acid starvation in
hanks’ balanced salt solution (hbss; invitrogen/gibco, carls-
bad, ca) for 2 hours in the presence of 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin and
10 ␮g/ml pepstatin. the effects of insulin (0.02–10 nm for 60
min) or phenylalanine (0.2 mm for 60 min) on autophagy were
determined in the absence of protease inhibitors. lysosomes
were visualized by incubation with lysotracker red dnd-99
(75 nm for 30 min; invitrogen/molecular probes, carlsbad,
ca). hepatocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20
min) and permeabilized with 0.5% triton x-100 (5 min).
nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bsa. anti-
bodies were diluted in 1% bsa to the following ratios:
anti-g␣i3, 1:1,000; rabbit anti-lc3, 1:300; goat anti-lc3 clone
f14, 1:200 (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca);
anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (eea-1), 1:400 (bd bio-
sciences, heidelberg, germany); and anti-protein disulfide
isomerase (pdi), 1:300 (bd biosciences). secondary detec-
tion was performed with alexa fluor-coupled antibodies
(invitrogen/molecular probes). nuclei were stained with
dapi (sigma, deisenhofen, germany), and cells were
analyzed on a lsm 510 meta confocal microscope (carl zeiss,
jena, germany). single optical slices of ⬇0.5 ␮m are shown.
in situ mouse liver perfusion and measurement of autophagic pro-
teolysis. livers of 8- to 12-week-old male mice with a body weight
of 20–25 g were perfused in situ essentially as described for the rat
in ref. 28. briefly, proteolysis was determined in separate perfusion
experiments as 3h-label release from mice that had been injected
i.p. with 5 ␮ci of l-[4,5-3h]leucine 16 h before the perfusion
experiment (1 ci ⫽ 37 gbq). livers from fed mice were prelabeled
in vivo by i.p. injection of 5 ␮ci of [3h]leucine, and 3h-label release
into the effluent was monitored as a measure of hepatic proteolysis.
because of different labeling of the animals in vivo, the release of
radioactivity was set to 100% during baseline conditions at 100 min
of perfusion time. all perfusion experiments were performed with
approval of the local animal care and use committee and super-
vising state authorities.
hepatocyte isolation and culture. the isolation of mouse hepato-
cytes was performed according to published procedures (28) with
