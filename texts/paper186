embryonic cerebral cortical progenitors are resistant to
apoptosis, but increase expression of suicide receptor
disc-complex genes and suppress autophagy following
ethanol exposure
terasa l. prock and rajesh c. miranda
background: in utero exposure to ethanol can result in severe fetal brain defects. previous studies
showed that ethanol induces apoptosis in differentiated cortical neurons. however, we know little
about ethanol’s effects on proliferating embryonic cortical progenitors. this study investigated the
impact of ethanol exposure on the fas/apo-1/cd95 suicide receptor pathway, and on the survival of
proliferating cortical neuroepithelial progenitors.
methods: murine embryonic-derived primary cortical neuroepithelial cells were maintained as
neurosphere cultures and exposed to a dose range of ethanol for periods ranging from 1 to 5 days.
programmed cell death was measured by 4 independent means (annexin-v staining, caspase activa-
tion, dna fragmentation, and autophagic vacuole formation). surface fas/apo-1 suicide receptor
expression was measured by ﬂow cytometry. expression of fas/apo-1-associated disc-complex
genes was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
results: ethanol exposure did not substantially increase apoptosis, necrosis, or surface fas/apo-
1 expression. moreover, ethanol significantly decreased caspase activation and autophagic activity.
finally, ethanol exposure induced mrna expression of genes that constitute the death receptor
complex.
conclusions: this study provides surprising evidence that ethanol does not induce either pro-
grammed cell death or necrosis of immature progenitors during neurogenesis, although ethanol may
render neural progenitors susceptible to future apoptotic insults. furthermore, our novel observation
that ethanol suppresses autophagy is consistent with a hypothesis that ethanol promotes premature
neural progenitor maturation. taken together with our previous data regarding the role of the fas/
apo-1 receptor in neural development, we conclude that ethanol disrupts basic proliferation and dif-
ferentiation machinery rather than initiating cell death per se.
key words: fetal alcohol syndrome, neurogenesis, apoptosis, fas/apo-1/cd95, differentiation.
h eavy prenatal ethanol exposure can re-
sult in a spectrum of physical abnormalities and
growth deﬁciencies, collectively known as the fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder (fasd). defects associated with fasd
include mental retardation, developmental delay, and
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (coles et al., 1997;

et al., 1996; roebuck et al., 1998; schonfeld et al., 2001;
thomas et al., 1998b). the developing cortex is an impor-
tant target of ethanol-induced damage. for example, it has
been demonstrated that prenatal ethanol exposure results
in a disproportionate reduction in frontal cortex size in the
absence of global microcephaly (wass et al., 2001).
much of the research on gestational exposure to ethanol
has focused on cell loss as a mechanism of ethanol-induced
damage. prenatal ethanol exposure during a crucial devel-
opmental period in the rat [gestational day (gd) 6 to
birth] leads to a significant decrease in the number of neu-
rons generated during the peak period of neurogenesis
(gd 12–19) (miller, 1988), and consequently, a decreased
neuron number in the mature cortex (miller and potempa,
1990). this cell loss has largely been attributed to the abil-
ity of ethanol to induce apoptosis (bhave and hoffman,
1997; bhave et al., 1999; cartwright et al., 1998; cheema et
al., 1999; dikranian et al., 2005; mcalhany et al., 2000;

2004; young et al., 2003). although we know that ethanol
can induce apoptosis of fetal cortical neurons in late ges-
tation (ramachandran et al., 2003), relatively few studies
(hao et al., 2003; kentroti and vernadakis, 1991; santi-
llano et al., 2005) have focused on the apoptotic effects of
ethanol on embryonic neural progenitors during early neu-
rogenesis. paradoxically, the onset of neurogenesis is
accompanied by a wave of apoptotic cell death, similar to
the death observed later in development as neurons seek
appropriate synaptic targets (ba¨ hr, 2000; blaschke et al.,
1996, 1998; cheema et al., 1999; de la rosa and de pablo,
2000; thomaidou et al., 1997).
indeed, apoptosis
occurring during neurogenesis is as crucial to normal
development as
the proliferation competency of
progenitors. in fact, disruption of apoptosis via overex-
pression of bcl-2 results in abnormal neurogenesis and
neuronal determination in xenopus embryos (yeo and
gautier, 2003).
is
our laboratory has been interested in the role of
apoptosis during the period of neurogenesis, and in par-
ticular the extent to which the suicide receptor fas/apo
(apoptosis)-1/cd95 is involved in the deletion of neural
precursor cells. we have previously shown the transient
expression of this receptor in cells of the developing cortex
during the peak period of naturally occurring apoptosis, in
close proximity to fasl-expressing cells (cheema et al.,
1999). in this same study, we illustrated that administra-
tion of fasl or anti-fas/apo-1 antibody induced
caspase-dependent cell death in primary embryonic
cortical neuroblast cultures, indicating that a functional
fas/apo-1 death pathway is present
in these neural
progenitors. we demonstrated that p53 activation is
followed by the induction of fas/apo-1 expression
(cheema et al., 2004). ethanol,
induces p53
expression (de-la-monte et al., 2000; kuhn and miller,
1998) and p53-dependent suicide factors including bax
(moore et al., 1999). furthermore, we observed an
increase in fas/apo-1 mrna expression in postnatal
organotypic
treated with ethanol,
coupled with a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis (che-
ema et al., 2000). this led us to hypothesize that the fas/
apo-1 receptor might be involved in mediating the apop-
totic consequences of ethanol exposure in immature
progenitors as well.
explants
in turn,
cortical
in the present study, we examined the vulnerability of
neural progenitors to ethanol-induced apoptosis during
the early period of neurogenesis in the mouse, an intensely
proliferative phase and a time when crucial cell fate deci-
sions are being made. given the evidence illustrating that
ethanol causes apoptosis of cortical neurons in both late
gestation and the early postnatal period, and also consid-
ering the effects of this teratogen in ultimately decreasing
the size of the cortex, we hypothesized that ethanol would
result in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis of prolif-
erating cortical progenitors. our previous data suggested
that the fas/apo-1 receptor was a candidate ethanol tar-
get (cheema et al., 2000); therefore, we also hypothesized
that ethanol would cause an increase in surface fas/apo-1
expression in neural progenitor cells along with an increase
in downstream adaptor proteins of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway.
ethanol.
effects of
interestingly,
contrary to our hypothesis, our data show that murine
neural progenitors obtained during the early period
of neurogenesis are relatively resistant to the apoptosis-
inducing
ethanol
dramatically decreases both caspase activation and the
formation of autophagic vacuoles. ethanol exposure failed
to cause an overall induction of surface fas/apo-1 expres-
sion. however, downstream adaptor proteins containing
death effector domains were up-regulated following etha-
nol treatment. new evidence regarding the role of the
disc-complex adaptor proteins and autophagy in differ-
entiation suggests that ethanol exposure during early
neurogenesis may alter cortical progenitor maturation.
these data suggest that ethanol exposure early in cortical
development may be detrimental in ways unrelated to
apoptosis—perhaps involving nonapoptotic functions of
the extrinsic suicide pathway.
isolation and culture of cortical progenitors
methods
timed pregnant c57bl6 mice were bred in-house, from breeder
pairs initially purchased from harlan (harlan, houston, tx). ges-
tational day 0.5 was the day that a vaginal mucus plug was detected.
pregnant females (gd 12.5) were anesthetized with a mixture of ket-
amine (0.09 mg/g body weight) and xylazine (0.106 mg/g body
weight) by intramuscular injection. all animal procedures were ap-
proved by the texas a&m university laboratory animal care
committee. fetuses were removed under aseptic conditions and
rinsed in chilled phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). fetal brains were
dissected, meningeal tissue was removed, and the structural precur-
sor of the neocortex was isolated. fetal cortical tissue from 3 to 4
litters per experiment was combined into a single collection tube,
dispersed by trypsinization (0.05%, invitrogen #25300-054; invitro-
gen, carlsbad, ca), and cells were counted using a hemocytometer.
cells were grown in serum-free mitogenic media (dmem-f12 in-
vitrogen #11039-24) supplemented with 20 ng/ml human recombi-
nant basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bfgf; bd biosciences #354060;
bd biosciences, franklin lakes, nj), 20 ng/ml human epidermal
growth factor (hegf; bd biosciences #356052), insulin, transferrin,
selenium (its)-x supplement (invitrogen #51500-056), 5 mg/ml
heparin (sigma #4784; sigma, st. louis, mo), 0.15 ng/ml leukemia
inhibitory factor (lif; alomone #l-200; alomone, jerusalem,
israel), and 20 nm progesterone (sigma #p7556). cells were allowed
to proliferate as neurospheres until cultures achieved a density of
2106 cells per t25 ﬂask (approximately 6–8 passages), and then
used for experiments.
ethanol treatment
neurosphere cultures at a density of 2106 cells per t25 ﬂask were
randomly assigned to control or ethanol treatment groups represent-
ing low [60–95 mg/dl (13–21 mm) based on gas chromatographic
analyses], moderate [130–218 mg/dl (28–47 mm)], and high doses
[270–350 mg/dl (58–76 mm)] of ethanol. ethanol-containing
medium was prepared freshly before use, from 95% ethanol (sigma),
and ethanol concentrations in fresh and culture-exposed medium
696
prock and miranda
were measured for each experiment, by gas chromatography. each
ﬂask was deﬁned as a single sample. culture medium was changed
every 2 days. control and ethanol-treated ﬂasks were capped tightly
with phenolic caps, and sealed with paraﬁlm to limit the loss of eth-
anol, and ethanol concentrations in the culture medium remained
stable through the course of the experiment. these measured doses
range in equivalence to consumption levels that can be attained by
social drinkers to those attained by chronic alcoholic patients
(adachi et al., 1991; perper et al., 1986). all values reported on
graphs and tables are averages of actual gas chromatography
measures of ethanol content taken from 6 experimental samples per
dosage condition.
flow cytometry
measurement of surface antigen levels was conducted according
to our previously published protocols (santillano et al., 2005) on a
ﬂow cytometer (facscalibur, beckton dickinson, franklin lakes,
nj). excitation wavelength was set at 488 nm (argon laser), and
emission spectra for ﬂuorescein and propidium iodide were 525 and
630 nm, respectively. analyses were generated using cell quest soft-
ware for macintosh (v. 3.5).
labeling for surface fas/apo-1/cd95 receptor expression
cells were harvested, washed twice in pbs, and triturated to dis-
sociate neurosphere structures into individual cells. cells were then
immediately ﬁxed in 1% paraformaldehyde buffered in pbs for
either 30 minutes or overnight at 4 1c. subsequently, cells were
washed twice in pbs and 106 cells were labeled with a ﬂuorescein-
conjugated antibody against the surface fas/apo-1/cd95 antigen
(pharmingen #554357; bd pharmingen, franklin lakes, nj). an
equal amount of ﬂuorescein-conjugated isotype-matched igg anti-
body was added to samples not receiving fas/apo-1/cd95 antibody
to account for nonspecific staining. fixed, unlabeled cells served to
measure background ﬂuorescence. the proportion of labeled cells
was analyzed via ﬂow cytometry from each sample (n 5 104–105 cells
per sample).
annexin-v staining for apoptosis detection
annexin-v labeling was conducted as per the annexin-v-fluores-
cein staining kit (roche #1858777; roche, basel, switzerland)
protocol, and as per our previously published protocols (cheema
et al., 1999). briefly, 106 cells were washed in pbs, resuspended in
labeling solution containing annexin-v-fluorescein and propidium
iodide, and incubated for 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. the
proportion of labeled cells was analyzed via ﬂow cytometry from
each sample (n 5 104–105 cells per sample).
elisa for apoptosis detection
we utilized a photometric enzyme-immunoassay for the in vitro
determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments
(cell death detection elisaplus; roche #1774425). briefly, 104
cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 minutes at room tempera-
ture. the lysate was centrifuged at 200g for 10 minutes, and 20 ml
from the supernatant was added to a streptavidin-coated microplate
for analysis. this solution was incubated for 2 hours at room tem-
perature with an antibody mixture of anti-histone–biotin (which
binds the histone component of the nucleosomes and captures the
immuno-complex via biotin to the
coated microplate) and
anti-dna-peroxidase (which binds the dna components of the
nucleosomes and is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase to provide
a color reaction). after incubation, the plate is washed 3 times with
incubation buffer and abts [2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonic acid)] solution is added to provide a color reaction. the
color product was measured by photometric analysis at a wavelength
of 405 nm, with a reference wavelength of 490 nm. all samples were
analyzed in triplicate, and to account for possible differences in the
amounts of cells lysed per sample, all values were normalized to total
protein levels.
homogenous caspase assay
we utilized a ﬂuorimetric assay for the quantiﬁcation of activated
caspases (homogenous caspase assay; roche #3005372). this
assay is sensitive for caspases 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. briefly, 104 cells
were simultaneously lysed and incubated in caspase substrate
[devd-rho110 (asp-glu-val-asp-rhodamine 110)] at 37 1c for 2
hours. activated caspases recognize and cleave at devd sites, and
free r110 is determined ﬂuorimetrically at 521 nm. the developed
ﬂuorochrome is proportional to the concentration of activated
caspases.
fluorimetric assay for detection of autophagic vacuoles
the presence of autophagic vacuoles was detected with the ﬂuo-
rescent dye monodansylcadaverine (mdc; sigma #30432) according
to a previously published report (biederbick et al., 1995). cells were
treated with ethanol for 72 hours, and then harvested by centrifuga-
tion and resuspended in a 0.05 mm solution of mdc dye in warm
serum-free mitogenic media (from 0.5 m stock solution in dmso),
and incubated at 37 1c for 1 hour. intracellular mdc ﬂuorescence
levels were measured by ﬂuorescence photometry in an flx-800
microplate reader (excitation wavelength 380 nm, emission wave-
length 525 nm). an aliquot of cells was harvested and starved in
warm hank’s balanced salt solution (invitrogen) for 1 hour to
induce autophagy and serve as a positive control. all samples were
analyzed in triplicate, and to account for possible differences in the
amounts of cells lysed per sample, all values were normalized to total
protein levels.
bca protein assay
protein concentrations of each lysate utilized for the cell death
detection elisa and autophagy assay were obtained using a bca
protein assay kit (pierce #23225; pierce, rockford, il).
rna extraction and cdna synthesis
total rna was extracted from ethanol-treated cultures using
trizoltm reagent (invitrogen #15596), followed by dnase treat-
ment and column puriﬁcation using the sv total rna isolation kit
(promega #23100 promega, madison, wi). the quality and quantity
of rna was assessed by microcapillary electrophoresis on an agi-
lent 2100 bioanalyzer (agilent, santa clara, ca). five micrograms
of total rna per ethanol-treated sample was reverse transcribed
with superscript iii (invitrogen #18080-093), utilizing the manufac-
turer’s protocol.
real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
real-time pcrs were conducted on a bio-rad myiqtm icycler
real-time machine using 96-well pcr plates (icycler 96 well; bio-
rad #2239441). reactions utilized iq sybr green supermix (bio-
rad #170-8880; bio-rad, hercules, ca), and a starting primer con-
centration of 10 mm. standard curves were created for each primer
set using various concentrations (ranging from 200 to 20 ng/ml) of
whole embryonic rna from untreated gd 12.5 cultures. all target
genes examined were compared with b-actin, a standard housekeep-
ing reference gene. no-template controls were included for each
primer set. we used a modiﬁcation of the method outlined by pfafﬂ
(2001) to quantify gene expression (see table 1 for primer character-
istics), which takes into account the primer efﬁciency and the mean

results
cortical progenitors are resistant to ethanol-induced
apoptosis
in the present study, we sought to determine whether
immature neural progenitors, obtained from the second
trimester-equivalent period of gestation, were vulnerable
to ethanol-induced apoptosis. we chose to assess levels of
apoptosis after ethanol exposure by measuring annexin-v
staining (phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer
leaflet of the cell membrane) by ﬂow cytometry. ethanol
treatment did not result in a statistically significant differ-
ence in the percentage of cells gated in the apoptotic (fig.
1a–1c) or in the necrotic fraction (fig. 2a–2c) regardless
of dosage or temporal exposure. however, the possibility
remained that by measuring an early event in apoptosis,
we failed to detect apoptosis that had already progressed
to a later stage. therefore, we measured dna fragmenta-
tion (cytoplasmic oligonucleosomal fragments), a late
event in the apoptotic cascade and one upon which a
variety of caspase-dependent and independent pathways
converge (chu et al., 2005; culmsee et al., 2005; slagsvold
et al., 2003). an overall anova indicated a statistically
significant interaction between ethanol concentration and
time in culture (po0.027). this interaction was mainly
due to exposure to low and moderate doses of ethanol.

we found that ethanol administration resulted in a
dramatic and statistically significant (anova, p 5 0.013)
decrease in caspase activation that was observable even at
the lowest dosage of ethanol (fig. 4).
ethanol suppresses autophagy in proliferating cortical
neuroepithelial precursors
autophagy is classiﬁed as a type ii cell death mechanism
characterized by the engulfment of cytoplasmic contents
and organelles into membrane-bound autophagic vesicles,
which are targeted for destruction to lysosomes within the
same cell (clarke, 1990). unlike apoptosis, autophagic
death does not result in pronounced dna degradation
(gozuacik and kimchi, 2004). thus, we chose to examine
whether or not ethanol might
induce cell death via
autophagy, using the uptake of mdc, a ﬂuorescent dye
that specifically marks the acidic autophagosomes/autoly-
sosomes and not other endosomal structures (biederbick
et al., 1995). we exposed gd 12.5-derived neural progeni-
tor cultures to ethanol for 72 hours and then measured the
incorporation of mdc dye (fig. 5). interestingly, we
observed a statistically significant decrease in autophagic
vacuole formation as indicated by a decrease in ﬂuores-
cence after treatment with moderate and high doses of
ethanol (anova, p 5 0.021).
ethanol treatment does not alter surface fas/apo-1
cd95 receptor expression
the developing brain expresses and is sensitive to the
fas/apo-1 suicide receptor (cheema et al., 1999, 2000,
2004; felderhoff-mueser et al., 2000; le-niculescu et al.,
1999). even though ethanol did not induce substantial
apoptosis, ethanol may increase sensitivity to apoptosis
signals from the environment by up-regulating fas/apo-1
receptor expression. neurosphere cultures were labeled

fragmentation as measured by the detection of (fig. 3,
overall fisher’s lsd po0.004). this was due to a statisti-
cally significant reduction in apoptosis for cells exposed to
ethanol for 1 or 2 days (po0.027 and 0.001, respectively),
but not 5 days. the moderate dosage (average ethanol
concentration, 167 mg/dl), in contrast, resulted in a small
but significant increase in dna fragmentation (overall
fisher’s lsd po0.002). this was due to either a return to
baseline control levels (at 1-day treatment) or a slight, but
statistically significant increase in dna fragmentation
after 2 and 5-day exposures (all po0.05). overall, the
highest dose (average ethanol concentration, 306 mg/dl)
did not result in a significant change in dna fragmenta-
tion. in the aggregate, a modest 0.2-fold increase in
apoptosis, as measured by dna fragmentation, was
observed only at the moderate ethanol dose. caspases
mediate both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic path-
ways, and therefore we next assessed overall caspase
activation in response to ethanol treatment as a measure

background ﬂuorescence, cells expressing above 101 units
of ﬂuorescence were deﬁned as fas/apo-1-expressing cells
(fastotal, fig. 6a), and cells gated in the fraction above 102
as expressing a high level of the surface receptor (fashi,
fig. 6a) as per our previously published protocols (che-
ema et al., 2004). ethanol exposure did not result in a
change in the percentage of cells gated in the fastotal or
fashi (fig. 6b and 6c) populations. however, we did
observe an inherent heterogeneity of fas/apo-1 expres-
sion among cortical progenitors that was unrelated to
ethanol exposure. by day 2, approximately 40 to 50% of
cells sampled expressed some level of fas/apo-1 (fastotal),
and of these 1 to 3% express a high amount of surface fas/
apo-1 (fashi). moreover, as the time spent in culture
increases, there is a pronounced and statistically signiﬁ-
cant (anova, p 5 0.001) decrease in overall expression
levels (fig. 6b and 6c), so that expression was close to the
limit of detection for control, low, and moderate alcohol
doses, and undetectable at the high dose.

overall a strong relationship exists between ethanol
administration and expression of this group of death

anol, we observed a general (although not statistically

autophagy, a lysozome-mediated cellular mechanism that
can result in programmed cell death. to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study examining the effect of
ethanol on autophagy, and surprisingly, we found that
ethanol exposure significantly reduced the formation of
autophagic lysozomes. the suppression of autophagy
indicates that ethanol also did not lead to a significant
destruction of cellular organelles. these experiments con-
ﬁrm initial studies in our laboratory demonstrating that
ventricular zone progenitors isolated from a somewhat
later developmental stage (i.e., the peak period of cortical
plate neurogenesis) exhibited a similar resistance to apop-
tosis (santillano et al., 2005).
despite some evidence suggesting that ethanol can kill im-
mature neuroblasts under specific circumstances (hao et al.,
2003; kentroti and vernadakis, 1991), ethanol-induced
apoptosis may be a differentiation state-specific phenom-
enon. for example,
the proapoptotic protein bax, a
necessary mediator of ethanol-induced apoptosis in differ-
entiating neurons (young et al., 2003), is not expressed in
proliferating cortical neuroepithelial cells, and its expression
is induced only following neuronal differentiation (wade
et al., 1999). the concept of developmental stages conferring
either vulnerability or resistance to ethanol is certainly a
documented phenomenon in the postnatal period, and in
other brain regions such as the cerebellum (heaton et al.,
2003; thomas et al., 1998a). cerebellar granule cells, for
example, exhibit delayed apoptosis in response to ethanol
exposure that follows a decline in their proliferation rate (li
et al., 2001), suggesting that cell cycle status may be linked to
ethanol sensitivity. given the inverse relationship between
the expression of proapoptotic factors like p53 and cell cycle
(wade et al., 1999), along with our observations that ethanol
induces cell cycle (santillano et al., 2005), it is likely that the
early proliferative stage of neurogenesis is a period of
relative resistance to ethanol-induced apoptosis. it is also
possible that sensitivity to ethanol-induced cell death is mod-
el system dependent rather than differentiation state depen-
dent, i.e., that neural progenitors are more resistant to
apoptosis simply because of the specific local milieu that
emerges with an aggregate of cells maintained as neuro-
spheres. however, the neurosphere model more closely
mimics the natural, cell-dense environment of the second
trimester neuroepithelium, consisting of high-density aggre-
gates of stem and progenitor cells within ventricular and
emerging subventricular zones, than do more typically used,
dissociated culture models. nevertheless, apoptosis resist-
ance is not absolute, as recent work in our laboratory
(unpublished observations) indicates that disruption of
c-kit signaling, or exit from cell cycle, does render progeni-
tor cells vulnerable to ethanol-induced apoptosis.
dis-regulation of the fas/apo-1 receptor system

the fas/apo-1 is

represent sem.
structures like the cerebral cortex. deletion of relatively
few neural progenitors from the neuroepithelium during
the critical developmental period of neuroepithelial prolif-
eration is likely to lead to a disproportionate reduction in
the growth of telencephalic structures. we isolated neuro-
epithelial cells from gd 12.5 mouse cerebral cortex to
capture neuroepithelial progenitors that would give rise to
the earliest (i.e., deepest) laminae of the developing cere-
bral cortical plate (angevine and sidman, 1961; caviness,
1982; takahashi et al., 1995) as well as progenitors that
give rise to later-developing laminae, as evidence from sev-
eral
laboratories suggests that initial fate speciﬁcation
occurs within the ventricular zone itself
(desai and
mcconnell, 2000; donoghue and rakic, 1999).
at the start of the reported experiments, we hypothe-
sized that ethanol would induce apoptosis in cortical pro-
genitors similar to our observed induction of apoptosis in
a more differentiated neural tissue (cheema et al., 2000).
we measured a variety of
features characteristic of
the apoptotic process, and our data show that cortical
progenitors maintained as neurosphere cultures are
remarkably resistant to ethanol-induced apoptosis, even
at doses typically attained only by chronic alcoholic indi-
viduals. interestingly,
total caspase activity was sup-
pressed by ethanol. the lack of caspase activation,
together with the fact that ethanol did not also induce
necrosis,
indicates that the alternate calpain pathway
(neumar et al., 2003) is also unlikely to be a target of
ethanol. we therefore investigated the effect of ethanol on

perinatal period, both by immature ventricular zone pro-
genitors, and later, by maturing cortical plate neurons
(cheema et al., 1999). additionally, our lab showed that
ethanol induced a dose-dependent increase in fas/apo-1
mrna in differentiated postnatal cortical explant cultures
(cheema et al., 2000). we subsequently found that high
levels of cell-surface fas/apo-1 expression are associated
with entry into the g2 and m phases of the cell cycle
(cheema et al., 2004), suggesting that this suicide receptor
may modulate progression through cell cycle checkpoints.
furthermore, the expression of fas/apo-1 is associated
with the activation of cell cycle-regulatory proteins like
p53, further supporting a role for the fas/apo-1 pathway
in cell cycle regulation. cortical progenitors maintained in
neurosphere cultures exhibit increased cell cycle activity in
response to ethanol exposure (santillano et al., 2005). we
therefore hypothesized that if ethanol induced cell cycle
activity, it would also increase the expression of the fas/
apo-1 in proliferating neural progenitors. the present
study demonstrates that neuroepithelial progenitors do
exhibit a nascent heterogeneity in cell surface fas/apo-1
expression. however, ethanol did not alter the numbers of
cells expressing either moderate or high levels of surface
fas/apo-1. because cell-surface fas/apo-1 expression in
embryonic cortical progenitors is tied to cell cycle and
because ethanol induced cell cycle, our data may be inter-
preted to suggest that ethanol
induces a dissociation
between cell cycle and sensitivity to receptor-mediated
apoptosis. this dissociation may permit the survival of
cell populations that would otherwise be eliminated. one
prediction that arises from these data is that ethanol
exposure may permit cells with defects in dna replication
to proceed through cell cycle checkpoints, leading to an
increased accumulation of defective neural progenitors,
and ultimately, the accumulation of aberrant neurons
within the cortical plate. these neurons may not behave
appropriately during development, and may contribute to
lamination defects and the formation of heterotopias
(komatsu et al., 2001; mooney et al., 2004).
alhough ethanol did not alter cell-surface fas/apo-1
expression, multivariate analyses indicate that ethanol has
a general dose-related inductive effect on the expression of
mrna transcripts for several death effector domain
(ded)-containing genes that constitute part of the death-
inducing signaling complex (disc),
the intracellular
initiating component of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade.
these data predict that while ethanol does not directly
induce apoptosis in immature neuroepithelial cells, expos-
ure to ethanol during the mitogenic period may render
daughter neuroblasts susceptible to apoptotic stimuli as
they differentiate into neurons.
evidence for an alternate hypothesis of ethanol-induced
neuroepithelial maturation
an alternate hypothesis, also collectively supported by
our data, is that ethanol promotes premature neuroepithe-
lial differentiation. while autophagy is often associated
with cell death, it also represents a major strategy for cel-
lular adaptation. autophagic degradation of long-lived
proteins and organelles enables a cell to adapt to stressful
conditions like amino acid starvation (gozuacik and
kimchi, 2004). autophagy is also associated with cellular
differentiation. for
example, undifferentiated colon
adenocarcinoma cells express high levels of autophagic
activity, and this activity is repressed following differenti-
ation (houri et al., 1995). similarly, while fas/apo-1 was
originally characterized as an obligatory cell-death recep-
tor (nagata and goldstein, 1995), more recent evidence
from a variety of laboratories including ours has shown
that this receptor also regulates cell cycle (cheema et al.,
2004) and differentiation (ceccatelli et al., 2004; cheema
et al., 1999; desbarats et al., 2003; tamm et al., 2004)
signaling cascades. additionally, disc-complex adaptor
proteins also exhibit nonapoptotic functions (park et al.,
2005). consequently, in the absence of ethanol-induced
apoptosis, the observed suppression of autophagy and
induction of disc mrna transcripts are consistent with
a model of ethanol-induced neuroepithelial maturation.
other data from our group also support this ‘‘premature
differentiation’’ hypothesis. for example, we have shown
that ethanol suppresses the expression of stem cell markers
like sca-1, abcg2, cd117, and cd133 and induces
asymmetric cell division (santillano et al., 2005). asym-
metric division, resulting in 2 dissimilar daughter cells,
promotes the emergence of neuronal lineage-committed
precursors from the cortical ventricular zone that then
proceed to populate the subventricular zone (noctor et al.,
2004), before differentiating into cortical plate neurons.
collectively, we interpret these data to indicate that etha-
nol promotes stem-cell to blast-cell differentiation in
embryonic cortical neuroepithelial-derived cells, and our
current data are certainly compatible with that hypothesis.
conclusion
our data collectively support an unexpected and sur-
prising conclusion—that ethanol
is not obviously or
immediately cytotoxic to cerebral cortical neuroepithelial-
derived progenitors. rather, the effects of ethanol appear
to be more complex and pervasive. ethanol appears to
inﬂuence cortical neuroepithelial maturation programs,
and collectively our data predict that episodes of maternal
ethanol consumption during the period of fetal neuroepi-
thelial proliferation are
long-term
consequences for subsequent neuronal differentiation.
furthermore, disrupting the timing of neuroepithelial
maturation during the second trimester-equivalent period
of brain development can lead to significant disorganiza-
tion of
the mature cortical
plate, without the need to invoke cytotoxicity as ethanol’s
mechanism of action.
