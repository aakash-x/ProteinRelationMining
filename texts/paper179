summary
misfolded proteins are usually arrested in the
endoplasmic reticulum (er) and degraded by
the er-associated degradation (erad) machinery.
several mutant alleles of pma1, the gene coding for
the plasma membrane h+-atpase, render misfolded
proteins that are retained in the er and degraded by
erad. a subset of misfolded pma1 mutants exhibit a
dominant negative effect on yeast growth since, when
coexpressed with the wild-type allele, both proteins
are retained in the er. we have used a pma1-d378t
dominant negative mutant
to identify new genes
involved in erad. a genetic screen was performed
for isolation of multicopy suppressors of a gal1-
pma1-d378t allele. atg19, a member of the cyto-
plasm to vacuole targeting (cvt) pathway, was found
to suppress the growth arrest phenotype caused by
the expression of pma1-d378t. atg19 accelerates the
degradation of pma1-d378t thus allowing the
co-retained wild-type pma1 to reach the plasma
membrane. atg19 was also able to suppress other
dominant lethal pma1 mutations. the degradation of
the mutant atpase occurs in the proteasome and
requires intact both erad and cvt/autophagy
pathways. we propose the cooperation of both path-
ways for an efficient degradation of misfolded pma1.
introduction
proteins entering the secretory pathway are modiﬁed,
folded and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (er)
before the delivery to their ﬁnal
localization (rapoport
et al., 1996). these processes are monitored by a quality
accepted 18 december, 2006.

control mechanism to ensure that only correctly folded and
assembled proteins exit the er (ellgaard and helenius,
2003). non-properly folded proteins are usually retained in
the er and eventually degraded by a mechanism known
as erad (er-associated degradation). this mechanism
involves retrograde translocation into the cytoplasm, ubiq-
uitination and degradation of the misfolded protein by the
proteasome (loayza et al., 1998; kostova and wolf, 2003;
ahner and brodsky, 2004). in yeast, substrates for this
pathway include mutant forms of integral membrane pro-
teins such as the a-factor transporter ste6 (loayza et al.,
1998),
the multidrug transporter pdr5 (plemper et al.,
1998) and the plasma membrane h+-atpase pma1 (wang
and chang, 1999; mason et al., 2006).
the present study has focused on the identiﬁcation of
new genes involved in erad of pma1 mutants. to this
end we have exploited the characteristics of some mutant
pma1 alleles which display a dominant lethal phenotype.
the h+-atpase, encoded by the pma1 gene (serrano
et al., 1986) belongs to the family of p-type cation pumps
(catty et al., 1997). pma1 is a polytopic cell surface
protein which generates the electrochemical proton gra-
dient essential for nutrient uptake by secondary active
transport (serrano, 1991). newly synthesized pma1 is
assembled as an oligomer in the er and delivered to the
cell surface via the secretory pathway (lee et al., 2002;
wang and chang, 2002). site-directed mutagenesis has
been extensively used to study the role of potentially
important residues of the enzyme and a large number of
mutants have been generated (morsomme et al., 2000).
these studies have allowed the identiﬁcation of a series
of mutations that cause cell growth arrest even when
wild-type pma1 is coexpressed (harris et al., 1994). this
dominant
lethal phenotype has been particularly well
characterized in the case of point mutations altering asp-
378,
forms the aspartyl-
phosphate intermediate during the catalytic cycle of the
enzyme. mutations at asp-378 render misfolded pma1
proteins that are retained in the er (dewitt et al., 1998).
accumulation of the misfolded protein induces er prolif-
eration leading to the formation of kar2-containing struc-
tures termed bip bodies (harris et al., 1994; portillo,
1997; wang and chang, 1999; ferreira et al., 2002). in
the case of pma1-d378n it has been shown that the
the essential
residue that

mutant enzyme is retained in the er and ultimately
degraded slowly (t1/2 = 51 min) in an ubiquitin-dependent
manner (wang and chang, 1999). when wild-type pma1
is coexpressed with this mutant allele it oligomerizes with
pma1-d378n resulting in the retention and degradation
by erad of both proteins (wang and chang, 1999). since
pma1 is essential for growth, the depletion of wild-type
pma1 at the cell surface caused by the expression of the
mutant enzyme leads to growth arrest. in fact, the tem-
perature sensitive mutation lcb1-100, impairing sphingoid
base synthesis, was reported to suppress the dominant
growth defect of pma1-d378n because wild-type pma1
fails to heterooligomerize with the mutant atpase (wang
and chang, 2002).
a genetic screen for mutations able to suppress the
dominant-negative growth phenotype of pma1-d378n
resulted in the identiﬁcation of eps1, a member of the
protein disulphide isomerase family (wang and chang,
1999). the subsequent genetic and biochemical analysis
led to propose a role for eps1 as a component of the
recognition machinery involved in erad (wang and
chang, 2003). however, the fact that some carboxyl ter-
minus truncated atpases are still retained in an eps1d
mutant (mason et al., 2006) suggests that additional com-
ponents must be involved in such recognition machinery.
in this work, we undertook a genetic approach designed
three different
to isolate multicopy suppressors of
dominant
lethal pma1 alleles (pma1-d378n, -d378e,
-d378t). we present here the isolation of atg19 as sup-
pressor of the dominant-negative growth phenotype of
pma1-d378t. attempts to isolate multicopy suppressors
of pma1-d378n and pma1-d378e dominant lethal alleles
were unsuccessful. atg19 was, ﬁrst,
identiﬁed as a
member of
the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (cvt)
pathway in yeast (leber et al., 2001; scott et al., 2001).
the cvt pathway mediates the transport to the vacuole of
two vacuolar resident proteins, a-mannosidase (ams1)
and aminopeptidase i (ape1) (kim et al., 1997; hutchins
and klionsky, 2001). ape1 is synthesized in the cytosol,
assembled into a large oligomeric structure and seques-
tered into newly formed double membrane structures to
form the cvt vesicles. these vesicles fuse with the vacu-
olar membrane liberating the inner vesicle into the
organelle lumen. the inner membrane is then degraded
allowing the cargo proteins access to their ﬁnal location.
the cvt pathway uses most of the molecular machinery
required for macroautophagy, a catabolic process induced
by starvation conditions that delivers cytosolic compo-
nents including organelles to the vacuole for degradation
and generation of an internal pool of nutrients. atg19 is
speciﬁc to the cvt pathway, being responsible for the
speciﬁc recognition of the two oligomeric cargo proteins
ape1 and ams1. atg19 interacts with both cargoes, and
with the components required for the formation of the cvt
that
in this study we report
vesicle, thus assisting in the speciﬁc recruitment of the
cargo proteins to the vesicle (levine and klionsky, 2004).
the overexpression of
atg19 suppresses the dominant-negative effect on cell
growth of the pma1-d378t allele. suppression by atg19
requires an intact cvt/autophagy machinery and is not
restricted to pma1-d378t mutant allele since other domi-
nant negative mutations located at different domains of
the atpase are also suppressed. suppression is due to
an accelerated and speciﬁc degradation by erad of the
mutant protein allowing the delivery of the wild-type pma1
to the plasma membrane.
results
atg19 overexpression suppresses the dominant growth
defect induced by pma1-d378t
mutant atpase altered in asp-378 is retained in the er
and degraded slowly by erad. the turnover rate of
pma1-d378n (t1/2 = 51 min) (wang and chang, 1999) is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of other erad membrane
substrates such as ste6–166 (t1/2 = 8 min) or sec61–2
(t1/2 = 12 min)
(loayza et al., 1998; vashist and ng,
2004). thus, we reasoned that
this delay in mutant
pma1 degradation could be caused by the presence in
low amounts of an erad component required to effi-
the misfolded pma1 for degradation. to
ciently direct
gain insight
into the molecular mechanism of mutant
pma1 retention and degradation in the er we screened
for genes that, when present in an episomal plasmid,
conferred the ability to grow to cells expressing mutant
pma1 altered in asp-378. yeast strains expressing
-d378e mutant alleles
ha-pma1-d378t,
under the control of
the galactose-inducible promoter
were transformed with a yep24-based genomic library.
after transformation and selective growth on sg medium
(see experimental procedures) we only were able to
isolate suppressors for ha-pma1-d378t allele, recover-
ing plasmid sup221 (fig. 1a). the insert carried in this
plasmid corresponded to a region of chromosome xv.
subcloning experiments indicated that the fragment con-
taining atg19 was enough to suppress the dominant
lethality of ha-pma1-d378t (fig. 1b).
-d378n or
atg19 is an essential component of the cvt pathway
involved in the recognition and selective targeting of ape1
and ams1 to the vacuole. to this end atg19 interacts not
only with the cargo proteins but also with two components
of the vesicle forming machinery, atg8 and atg11 (shintani
et al., 2002), and it has been shown that
the atg19
carboxyl-terminus is essential for its function in the cvt
pathway (leber et al., 2001). a mutant allele of atg19
lacking 32 c-terminal amino acids, placed under the
control of the gal1 promoter, was unable to suppress the

subclones used to test the ability to suppress the dominant lethal phenotype of ha-pma1-d378t mutant atpase. the different fragments of
sup221 were cloned in plasmid yep352.
b. drop test for growth of yeast strains coexpressing ha-pma1-d378t dominant lethal gene and one of the two subclones derived from
plasmid sup221. cells were grown in sr medium during 24 h at 30°c. after growth, cells were suspended in water at od660 = 0.2, serially
diluted (10-1 and 10-2) and 5 ml dropped in sd and sg media. suppression is deﬁned as the ability of yeast strain to grow on sg medium. at
least two independent transformants were tested for suppression.
c. drop test for suppressor capacity of an inactive atg19 mutant. wild-type yeast by4741 carrying the ha-pma1-d378t allele was
transformed with either empty plasmid (pyes2.0), a c-terminus truncated allele of atg19 (pyes·atg19-dct) or wild-type atg19
(pyes·atg19). drop tests for growth of the transformants in sd and sg media were performed as described above.
dominant lethality of the mutant pma1 (fig. 1c), thus
suggesting that
the atg19 carboxyl-terminus is also
required for its role in the suppression, and that other
components of the pathway could be required for atg19-
dependent suppression. to investigate this possibility we
analysed the capacity of atg19 to suppress the dominant
lethality of ha-pma1-d378t in yeast strains carrying dele-
tions in genes encoding components of both cvt and
macroautophagy (atg8d, atg11d, atg12d, atg17d and
ypt7d) pathways (levine and klionsky, 2004). the results
(fig. 2) suggest that atg19 requires an undamaged cvt/
autophagy pathway to suppress the dominant lethality of
the mutant atpase. in order to determine whether other
components of the cvt pathway exhibited the same behav-
iour than atg19, we cloned atg8 and atg11 under the
control of the gal1 promoter and analysed their ability to
suppress the dominant lethality of ha-pma1-d378t in both
wild type and atg19d strains. none of them was able to
suppress the dominant negative phenotype of the mutant
atpase in any of the backgrounds tested (data not shown).
we next investigated whether the atg19 suppression
ability was restricted to pma1-d378t or extended to other

under the control of the gal1 promoter several dominant
lethal mutations located at different pma1 domains (mor-
somme et al., 2000) and tested the ability of pyes·atg19
to suppress the dominant negative effect on cell growth of
the pma1 mutants. the results (fig. 3) showed that
atg19 overexpression suppressed the dominant lethal
phenotype of all the pma1 mutants tested.

ined the stability of the mutant atpase by cycloheximide-
chase analysis in wild-type cells coexpressing atg19 and
either ha-pma1 or ha-pma1-d378t alleles. figure 4
shows that the ha-pma1-d378t atpase decayed much
more rapidly in cells overexpressing atg19 than in cells
expressing only the genomic copy. this is in contrast with
the stability of the wild-type pma1 which is not affected at
all by atg19 overexpression. we also examined the effect
of atg19 overexpression on the degradation rate of two
typical erad substrates, namely ste6–166 and cpy*, by
cycloheximide-chase analysis. atg19 did not alter the sta-
bility of these mutant proteins (data not shown) suggest-
ing a speciﬁc role for atg19 in the degradation of the

pressed with mutant atpase. to address this question
we analysed the stability and localization of a myc-
tagged version of wild-type pma1 in cells expressing
both atg19 and ha-pma1-d378t genes. figure 5a
shows that in cells overexpressing atg19 the wild-type
myc-pma1 remained relatively stable while ha-pma1-
d378t was rapidly degraded. in the absence of atg19
overexpression, both myc-pma1 and ha-pma1-d378t
atpases were degraded at a similar rate. the localiza-
tion of wild type and mutant pma1 was studied in par-
allel by indirect

induced as described before. cycloheximide was added and

fig. 4. myc tagged-pma1 protein was detected using a polyclonal
antibody against the myc epitope (wt) and mutant ha-pma1-d378t
atpase was detected using the monoclonal antibody 12ca5
against the ha epitope (d378t).

wild-type myc-pma1 atpase (wt) while a monoclonal anti-ha
antibody and fitc-conjugated secondary antibody were used to
detect the mutant ha-pma1-d378t atpase (d378t). staining of
the cell nucleus is also shown (dapi).
it
above,
is widely documented that expression of a
dominant lethal atpase mutant leads to the formation of
large punctate structures where the mutant pma1 and
the er marker kar2 colocalize (harris et al., 1994;
wang and chang, 1999; mason et al., 2006). figure 5b
shows a double staining of yeast cells with anti-ha and
anti-myc antibodies.
in cells that did not overexpress
atg19 the typical punctate structures were decorated
with both antibodies and there was no observable stain-
ing on the cell surface. as expected, in most of the cells
ha staining was coincident with myc staining suggesting
that wild type and mutant pma1 colocalized at the same
atg19 function in degradation of misfolded pma1 1073
structures. colocalization of wild type and mutant pma1
with the er marker dpm1 was further conﬁrmed by
sucrose density gradient (data not shown). by contrast,
in cells overexpressing atg19,
the anti-myc antibody
decorated the cell surface whereas there was no
obvious staining with the anti-ha antibody. this ﬁnding
suggests that the atg19-dependent accelerated degra-
dation of ha-pma1-d378t abolishes myc-pma1 reten-
tion, thus allowing export of the wild-type pma1 to the
cell surface. a simple explanation for
that
wild-type pma1 escapes from the er and reaches
the plasma membrane would be that atg19 interferes
with

co-immunoprecipitation experiments of the mutant and
wild-type forms of pma1 in the presence and absence of
atg19 did not support this hypothesis (data not shown).
heterooligomerization.
the fact
pma1
atg19 accelerates degradation of mutant pma1-d378t
by erad
in yeast, erad substrates are degraded in the
proteasome. on the other hand, atg19 is required for the
selective recognition of oligomerized cargo proteins as a
ﬁrst step for their transport to the vacuole. therefore, we
next asked whether atg19-dependent suppression led
pma1-d378t to the proteasome or to the vacuole for
degradation. to discern between these possibilities, we
analysed the atg19 suppression ability in mutants deﬁ-
cient in either vacuole (pep4d) or proteasome (pre1-1
pre2-2)-dependent protein degradation. the results
(fig. 6a) show that atg19 suppression was not altered in
a pep4d strain. in contrast, when atg19 and ha-pma1-
d378t were coexpressed in a pre1 pre2 mutant strain,
cells failed to grow suggesting that an active proteasome
is required for suppression and that therefore ha-pma1-
d378t is degraded in a proteasome-dependent fashion.
this was further conﬁrmed by analysing the stability of the
mutant atpase in either pep4d or pre1 pre2 mutant cells
by cycloheximide-chase experiments (fig. 6b).
in wild
type and pep4d mutant cells the overexpression of atg19
induced a rapid degradation of the mutant atpase and, by
contrast, in the pre1 pre2 mutant an increased steady-
state level of the mutant atpase was observed. we next
studied the requirement of different components of the
erad pathway for atg19-dependent suppression. for
this purpose we coexpressed atg19 and ha-pma1-
d378t in strains carrying deletions in genes required for
erad of soluble and/or multispanning membrane pro-
teins (hrd1, hrd3, der1, ubc7, npl4, and cue1)
(kostova and wolf, 2003). we found (fig. 7) that atg19-
dependent suppression of pma1-d378t required genes of
the general machinery of erad (hrd1, hrd3, ubc7,
npl4, and cue1) but not those involved in the speciﬁc
degradation of glycosylated proteins (der1). altogether

the results presented suggest that pma1-d378t degrada-
tion requires the erad/proteasome system.
discussion
dominant lethal alleles of the yeast plasma membrane
atpase such as pma1-d378t produce misfolded proteins
that are retained in the er and degraded slowly by the
erad machinery. the dominant lethal phenotype of these
alleles is caused by the co-retention of wild-type pma1 in
the er leading to the gradual depletion of this essential
enzyme from the cell surface. in the present study, we
performed a genetic screening for multicopy suppressors
of the dominant lethality of ha-pma1-d378t. using this
approach we isolated atg19, one of the speciﬁc compo-
the
nents of
that
mechanism of atg19-dependent suppression of
the
dominant lethality is based on an increased degradation
of the mutant atpase by erad, thus allowing the wild-
the cvt-pathway. our data suggest
type pma1 to escape from the er and reach the plasma
membrane, ﬁnally resulting in cell growth. this is in con-
trast with the mechanism of suppression proposed for the
eps1 mutation, which allows the delivery of both wild type
and mutant atpases to the plasma membrane thus
eluding the mutant pma1 degradation by erad (wang
and chang, 1999).
one remarkable ﬁnding of this study is the observation
that efficient degradation of ha-pma1-d378t mutant
atpase requires an undamaged cvt/autophagy pathway.
to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst report suggesting a role
for the cvt/autophagy machinery in degradation of mis-
folded proteins by erad in yeast. in macroautophagy,
cytoplasmic components are non-selectively sequestered
within autophagosomes for degradation in the vacuole/
lysosome, whereas the cvt/autophagy is a selective
pathway that operates constitutively delivering resident
proteins to the vacuole. many of the components of the
autophagic machinery are used for this selective pathway
(levine and klionsky, 2004). the process described here
exhibits atg19 dependence, suggesting selective cargo
recognition.
in the cvt pathway atg19 interacts with the vesicle
forming machinery through its c-terminal domain. our
results show that this domain is also needed for the sup-
pressor function suggesting a similar role for atg19 in both
processes. moreover, it has been recently reported that
atg19 is ubiquitinated in vivo, and that both attachment
and ubp3-dependent removal of ubiquitin are required for
its full activity (baxter et al., 2005). ubiquitination and
deubiquitination of atg19 are also apparently required for

fig. 7. atg19-dependent suppression requires an undamaged
erad pathway. wild-type by4741 and derivatives carrying null
alleles of genes involved in erad mechanism were transformed
with ha-pma1-d378t allele and pyes·atg19. drop tests for
growth of the transformants on sd and sg media were performed
as described in experimental procedures. identical results were
obtained with three different transformants.

atg19 to function as suppressor of the dominant lethality
of pma1-d378t, since in an ubp3d strain atg19-
dependent suppression failed (data not shown). another
well established fact is that atg19 physically interacts with
its cargoes ape1 and ams1 (shintani et al., 2002). there-
fore, we searched for an interaction between atg19 and
pma1-d378t using co-immunoprecipitation techniques.
all attempts to detect such an interaction were unsuc-
cessful (data not shown) suggesting that the atg19 cargo
may not be pma1-d378t itself.
several possible models could account for the observed
involvement of the cvt/autophagy pathway in the efficient
degradation of the misfolded mutant pma1 by erad. the
simplest one is that erad/proteasome and cvt/autophagy
systems act consecutively to efficiently degrade pma1-
d378t. in this working model the degradation of the mis-
folded atpase by the erad/proteasome would produce
proteolytic peptides that could eventually aggregate and
inhibit the proteasome, thus slowing the degradation of the
mutant atpase. the cvt/autophagy pathway would be
responsible for the removal of the pma1-derived aggre-
gates from the proteasome via their recognition as cargo
by atg19. therefore, the release of proteasome inhibition
would result in an increased rate of pma1-d378t degrada-
tion by the erad system. proteasomal degradation of
proteins renders peptides with an average size of 2–25
residues long, that generally become further degraded to
free amino acids by other proteases in the cytosol (piwko
and jentsch, 2006).the inhibition of the proteasome activ-
ity by aggregates of proteolytic peptides is not unprec-
edented and has been particularly well characterized in the
case of the huntington’s disease. a central event in hun-
tington’s disease is the proteasomal production of a hun-
tingtin fragment containing a polyq repeat
forms
aggregates in affected neurons (difiglia et al., 1997). in
polyq-disease cell models and in vitro enzymatic assays
has been recently observed that polyq aggregates impair
the proteasome function ﬁnally leading to accumulation of
the aberrant protein (bennett et al., 2005; diaz-hernandez
et al., 2006).
that
control
the results of our study add a new piece to the machin-
ery of protein quality
in saccharomyces
cerevisiae. future research aiming at the identiﬁcation of
the putative pma1-derived proteolytic peptides,
their
impact on proteasome activity together with the analysis
of the mechanism of their transport to the vacuole will help
to elucidate the way in which cvt/autophagy is
co-ordinated with the erad/proteasome system.

synthetic media containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base
w/o amino acids, 2% dextrose (sd), 2% raffinose (sr) or 2%
galactose (sg) and the appropriate requirements were used.
standard methods for yeast
transformation, culture and
manipulation were used (kaiser et al., 1994). unless other-
wise indicated, to test the dominant lethality of the pma1-
d378t allele, yeast strains were grown on sr for 24 h,
suspended in water to an od660 = 0.1 and 5 ml were dropped
on sd and sg agar plates.
in cycloheximide-chase experiments the different transfor-
mants were grown in sr medium to mid-exponential phase
(od660 = 0.8–1), collected, resuspended in sg medium and
cultured during 4 h to induce the expression of the pma1 and
atg19 alleles. cycloheximide was added to a ﬁnal concen-
tration of 200 mg ml-1 and samples of 50 od were taken at the
indicated times and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
plasmids
plasmids pfp238, pfp680, pfp2357 and pfp2367 are
derivatives of the leu2 single copy plasmid prs315 (sikor-
ski and hieter, 1989) and express a haemagglutinin (ha)-
tagged wild-type pma1 (pfp238), pma1-d378t (pfp680),
pma1-d378e (pfp2357) and pma1-d378n (pfp2367)
the gal1 promoter
mutant alleles under the control of
(referred as ha-pma1, ha-pma1-d378t,
-d378e and
-d378n, respectively, in the text). these plasmids were gen-
erated by cloning a 0.7 kb ecori–xhoi fragment containing
the entire gal1 promoter (cid et al., 1987) and a 4.3 kb
xhoi–hindiii fragment containing the ha-tagged pma1 allele
(portillo, 1997) into the ecori and hindiii sites of prs315.
plasmids expressing the ha-tagged pma1 alleles containing
r271t, k474r and d638n mutations under the control of the
gal1 promoter were built by replacing a 3.5 kb bsteii–
hindiii fragment containing the desired mutation (portillo,
1997) with the corresponding fragment in pfp238. plasmid
pib1910 is a derivative of the trp1 centromeric plasmid
ycplac22 (gietz and sugino, 1988) and expresses myc-
tagged wild-type pma1 under the control of the gal1 pro-
moter (referred as myc-pma1 in the text). plasmid pib1910
was constructed by cloning the 0.7 kb ecori–xhoi fragment
containing the gal1 promoter and the 4.3 kb xhoi–hindiii
fragment containing the myc-tagged pma1 allele into the
ecori and hindiii sites of ycplac22. the quickchange site
directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) was used
to introduce the 10 amino acid myc epitope after the second
codon of wild-type atpase using the 4.3 kb xhoi–hindiii frag-
ment of the pma1 gene previously subcloned into plasmid

psk (stratagene, la jolla, ca). the correct insertion of the
epitope was veriﬁed by dna sequencing. the insertion of the
myc-epitope had no deleterious effects on the function or
regulation of the atpase (data not shown). plasmids pib1474
and pib1882 are derivatives of pyes2.0 (invitrogen, san
diego, ca) and express the wild-type atg19 and an inactive
allele of atg19 lacking 32 c-terminal amino acids, respec-
tively, both placed under the control of the gal1 promoter
(referred as pyes·atg19 and pyes·atg19-dct in the text).
construction of pib1474 has been already described (leber
et al., 2001). plasmid pib1882 was created by cloning a
1.1 kb bamhi–xhoi fragment obtained from plasmid pgfp-
atg19dc32 (leber et al., 2001) into the corresponding sites
of pyes2.0.
genetic screen
yeast strains expressing ha-pma1-d378t,
-d378e or
-d378n were transformed with 50 mg of dna from a yep24-
based library (carlson and botstein, 1982). approximately
10 000 transformants were selected in sr medium. trans-
formed cells were pooled and plated in sg medium to induce
the expression of the dominant lethal alleles. plasmids were
rescued from those yeasts able to grow on galactose medium
(ward, 1990) and retransformed to conﬁrm their ability to
suppress the dominant
the mutant
atpase. inserts contained in the suppressor plasmids were
partially sequenced.
lethal phenotype of
cells lysis and immunoblotting
total yeast protein extracts were prepared by vortexing with
glass beads in buffer containing 50 mm tris-hcl ph 8, 5 mm
edta and a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche, manheim,
germany). the homogenate was cleared from intact cells by
centrifugation for 10 min at 300 g (beckman ja-20 rotor). the
supernatant was then centrifuged at 15000 g for 20 min. the
resulting pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg
protein ml-1 in laemmli loading buffer (laemmli, 1970). pro-
teins were resolved in 8% sds-polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis and transferred to a pvdf membrane (immobilon p,
millipore)
immunodetection using mouse monoclonal
12ca5 (roche, manheim, germany) against the ha epitope
or rabbit polyclonal antibody against the myc epitope (sigma,
st louis, mo) followed by incubation with a secondary anti-
body conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (bio-rad, hercules,
ca). densitometric analysis of western blots was performed
using the nih image software. protein concentration was
determined by the bradford method (bradford, 1976) with the
bio-rad protein assay reagent (bio-rad, hercules, ca) and
bovine igg as standard.
for
immunoﬂuorescence
strain fy1679-08a was cotransformed with pfp238,
pib1910 and pib1474 and transformants were selected in sr
medium. cells were cultured in sr medium overnight at
30°c, collected, resuspended in sg medium and, to induce
the expression of gal1-dependent genes, cultured for 4 h at
30°c. cells were ﬁxed and stained for immunoﬂuorescence
as described (pringle et al., 1991) using mouse monoclonal
12ca5 anti-ha and rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibodies as
primary antibodies followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit or fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse (jackson
immunoresearch, west grove, pa).
