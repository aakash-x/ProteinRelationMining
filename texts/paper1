abstract
tryptamine derivatives are a family of biogenic amines that have been
suggested to be modulators of brain function at physiological concentra-
tions. however, pharmacological concentrations of these amines display
amphetamine-like properties, and they seem to play a role in brain disor-
ders. amphetamines induce autophagy in nerve cells, and this type of cell
death has also been involved in neurodegenerative diseases. in the present
work, we clearly demonstrate for the very ﬁrst time that high concentra-
tions of tryptamine (0.1–1 mm) induce autophagy in ht22 and sk-n-sh
nerve cell lines and in primary cultures of astrocytes, glial cells being less
sensitive than neurons. ultrastructural cell morphology shows all of the
typical hallmarks of autophagy. there is no nuclear chromatin condensa-
tion, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are swollen, and a great
number of double-membraned autophagosomes and residual bodies can be
shown in the cytoplasm. autophagosomes and residual bodies contain mi-
tochondria, membranes, and vesicles and remain unabridged until the cell
membrane is disrupted and the cell dies. the same results have been
found when cells were incubated with high concentrations of 5-methoxy-
tryptamine (0.1–1 mm). our results establish a possible link between
the role of tryptamine derivatives in brain disorders and the presence of
autophagic cell death in these kinds of disorders. anat rec part a, 288a:

tryptamines (i.e., tryptamine and its derivatives) are a
family of psychoactive amines widely present in nature.
although most of them have been initially considered just
as metabolic by-products in the mammal brain, recent evi-
dence suggests a physiological role of this family of mole-
cules as modulators of neuronal and glial function (berry,
2004). tryptamine brain concentrations are within the
nanomolar range, but much higher amounts have been
found in, for example, dry fermented sausages or forage
grasses (cheeke, 1995; suzzi and gardini, 2003). high
concentrations of tryptamine derivatives have ampheta-
mine-like actions, increasing dopamine and norepinephrine

cells (weil and davis, 1994). tryptamine derivatives in the
forage grass phalaris cause sudden death and a neurologic
syndrome in livestock (bourke et al., 1990; bourke and
carrigan, 1992). the neurologic syndrome is characterized
by head nodding, stiff gait with muscle tremors, incoordi-
nation, and frequent falling (bourke et al., 1990), symp-
toms similar to those found in some human neurodegenera-
tive diseases. in fact, tryptamine derivatives have been
proposed to play a role in brain disorders such as alzhei-
mer’s and parkinson’s diseases or schizophrenia (crino
et al., 1989; chen et al., 1996; berry, 2004).
autophagy is a closely regulated process of degradation
and recycling of cellular constituents, participating in or-
ganelle turnover and in the bioenergetic management of
starvation. despite the fact that there are several molec-
ular markers of autophagy in mammal cells, the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying autophagy remain little un-
derstood, and most of the existing information has been
provided by studies in yeasts (reggiori and klionsky,
2002). thus, the best indication of autophagy in mammal
cells is still its characteristic ultrastructural features.
this process begins with the formation of double-mem-
braned autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes) containing
cytoplasmic components and the dilation of both mito-
chondria and endoplasmic reticulum (er). although the
origin of the double-membraned autophagic vacuoles re-
mains unclear, they have been suggested to be originated
from the golgi apparatus (bras et al., 2005). the fusion
of lysosomes with autophagic vacuoles (autophagolyso-
somes) leads to the digestion of the sequestered cytoplas-
mic components and the compaction of the two limiting
membranes. finally, the remains of the digestion become
electron-dense structures called residual bodies (glaumann
et al., 1981). this process allows the cell resisting starvation
or essential amino acid deprivation before entering an apo-
ptotic process (boya et al., 2005) and getting energy from
the physiological renewal of its components (yoshimori,
2004; bras et al., 2005).
besides its physiological function, autophagy is also a
form of programmed cell death and seems to play a role in
some pathological situations, such as neurodegenerative
disorders (anglade et al., 1997; petersen et al., 2001; si-
korska et al., 2004; liberski et al., 2005; nixon et al.,
2005). brain biopsies of patients with creutzfeldt-jakob
disease showed a great number of nerve cells with ultra-
structural morphology of autophagy, thus suggesting that
autophagy contributes to neuronal loss in prionic encepha-
lopathies (sikorska et al., 2004; liberski et al., 2005).
accumulation of lysosomes within neurons is a neuropa-
thologic characteristic of alzheimer’s disease brains, and
it has been recently reported that this accumulation in-
volves extensive autophagic processes (nixon et al., 2005).
postmortem analyses of parkinson’s disease brains indi-
cate that dead nigral neurons present ultrastructural mor-
phology of either apoptosis or autophagy (anglade et al.,
1997).
it has been recently shown that the degeneration of do-
paminergic neurons induced by methamphetamine also
involves autophagy (larsen et al., 2002). given the am-
phetamine-like effects of high concentrations of trypt-
amines (berry, 2004) and their possible role in neurodege-
nerative disorders (crino et al., 1989; chen et al., 1996;
berry, 2004), in the present report we study the effect of
tryptamine in mouse ht22 and human sk-n-sh neuro-
nal cell lines and in primary cultures of astrocytes. we

kindly provided by dr. david schubert (salk institute for
biological studies, la jolla, ca). sk-n-sh cells were
purchased from atcc (htb-10). cultures of primary
astrocytes from wistar rat brains, maintenance and seed-

described (martin et al., 2002; herrera et al., 2004).
quantitative results were analyzed by one-way anova
followed by a student-neumann-keuls test for statistical
signiﬁcance.
for electron microscopy analyses, cells were collected
by trypsinization (0.05% w/v trypsin and 1 mm edta in
phosphate-buffered saline) and washed once in phos-

removed, and the cell pellet was embedded in 2% w/v
agar in pbs. samples were postﬁxed in oso4 for 15 min at
48c, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in spurr resin
(ems, fort washington, pa). ultrathin sections (90 nm)
were cut with an ultratome ultracut e (reichter-jung,
vienna, austria) and stained with uranyl acetate and
reynolds’s lead citrate as described elsewhere (reynolds,
1963). photographs were taken by means of a transmission

working at 50 kv.
results
ht22 cells were incubated for 24 hr with concentrations
of tryptamine or 5-methoxytryptamine between 100 nm
and 1 mm. a striking decrease in cell number can be
shown after incubation with 0.1–1 mm concentrations of
both amines (fig. 1a). this decrease is due to cell death
and not to inhibition of cell proliferation since treated cells
(fig. 1c and d) display morphological features of cell
death, such as cell shrinkage and detachment, in compari-

son to control cells (fig. 1b). cells have intracellular gran-
ules and vacuoles that can be clearly shown by light mi-
croscopy (fig. 1e–g).
in order to characterize the cell death process from a
morphological point of view, electron microscopy analysis
of ht22 cells treated with 1 mm tryptamine or 1 mm 5-
methoxytryptamine for 24 hr was carried out. figure 2b
and c show that both tryptamine- and 5-methoxytrypt-
amine-induced cell death are similar and have morpho-
logical features of autophagy. nuclear chromatin is not
condensed, and the integrity of nuclear and cell mem-
branes is preserved (fig. 2b and c) until the latest stage
of the autophagic process (fig. 2d). cells present a great
number of autophagosomes and residual bodies, contain-
ing cytoplasmic components and membrane-like struc-
tures (fig. 2b–f), which remain unabridged even after
cell membrane breakage and cell death (fig. 2d and
e). the surrounding membranes are not always clearly
shown (fig. 2e), perhaps because of compaction of the two
limiting membranes (glaumann et al., 1981), although
autophagosomes have a double membrane as expected
tryptamine induces autophagy in brain cells
1029
the mechanism by which tryptamine induces autophagy is
beyond the objectives of the present work. however, phar-
macological concentrations of tryptamines have ampheta-
mine-like effects (berry, 2004), methamphetamine has
been shown to induce autophagy in dopaminergic neurons
by increasing dopamine release and inhibiting its uptake
(larsen et al., 2002), and dopamine induces autophagy in
striatal neurons and dopaminergic cell
lines (petersen
et al., 2001; gomez-santos et al., 2003). therefore, high
concentrations of tryptamine may induce autophagy in
brain cells by increasing dopamine release and inhibiting
its uptake. supporting this possibility, sk-n-sh has been
previously characterized as a dopaminergic cell line (kher-
adpezhouh et al., 2003), and ht22 cells have functional do-
pamine transporters and receptors (maher and davis,
1996; ishige et al., 2001).
we showed that astrocytes are less sensitive to trypt-
amine than nerve cells, and this fact can also be explained
in terms of monoamine metabolism. glial cells do not pro-
duce dopamine but they importantly contribute to the con-
trol of extracellular dopamine levels and the detoxiﬁcation
of this monoamine (wilson, 1997; inazu et al., 1999). they
have stronger machinery for dopamine detoxiﬁcation than
neurons, and they cannot release dopamine so that inhibi-
tion of dopamine uptake would only affect the dopamine
present in the serum of the culture medium. furthermore,
dopamine toxicity is thought to be mediated by oxidative
stress (fahn and cohen, 1992) and we observed that the
expression of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxi-
dase and manganese superoxide dismutase in astrocytes
is higher than in ht22 cells (three- and fourfold, respec-
tively; data not shown). additionally, normal intracellular
concentrations of glutathione, the main intracellular anti-
oxidant, are also higher in astrocytes than in ht22 cells
(3.5 and 1.5 nmoles glutathione/mg protein, respectively;
data not shown).
the neurologic syndrome in livestock caused by trypt-
amine derivatives from forage grasses resembles symp-
toms of human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
and parkinson’s disease (bourke et al., 1990; cheeke,
1995). both autophagy and tryptamine derivatives seem
to be involved in these and other human neurodegenera-
tive disorders (berry, 2004; sikorska et al., 2004; nixon
et al., 2005). tryptamine derivatives have amphetamine-
like effects (berry, 2004), and amphetamines have been
described to induce autophagy in nerve cells (larsen
et al., 2002). however, as far as we know and despite
their amphetamine-like effects, tryptamine derivatives
have not been previously related to autophagy or linked
to the morphological features found in brain disorders.
thus, the results presented here add a new insight into
the relationship between morphological features of brain
disorders and the possible role of tryptamines in these
diseases.

(fig. 2f). mitochondria are swollen from the ﬁrst stages of
the process (fig. 2g).
in order to extend our observations to other brain cells,
we incubate sk-n-sh dopaminergic nerve cells and pri-
mary cultures of astrocytes for 24 hr with several concen-
trations of tryptamine (1 mm to 1 mm). tryptamine also in-
duced cell death in these cells, as can be shown in figure 3,
but we found that astrocytes are more resistant to trypt-
amine toxicity than nerve cells. as previously shown in
ht22 cells, tryptamine-treated sk-n-sh and astrocytes
show shrinkage (fig. 3c and e) in comparison to control
cells (fig. 3b and d) and presented intracellular vacuoles
and granules that are visible by light microscopy (fig. 3,
inserts). ultrastructural study showed that these cells also
display features of autophagy after incubation with 1 mm
tryptamine for 24 hr (fig. 4). a great number of double-
membraned autophagosomes and residual bodies contain-
ing membrane-like structures and cytoplasmic components
are clearly shown in the cytoplasm. nuclear chromatin
does not present alterations, mitochondria are swollen, and
nuclear and cell membranes remain unabridged until the
latest stage of the process. the same results were obtained
when cells were incubated with 1 mm 5-methoxytrypt-
amine for 24 hr (data not shown).
discussion
our results clearly demonstrate the induction of autoph-
agy in brain cells by high concentrations of tryptamine.
