interruption of mtor-dependent signaling by rapamycin is
known to stimulate autophagy, both in mammalian cells and in
yeast. because activation of ampk also inhibits mtor-depend-
ent signaling one would expect stimulation of autophagy by
ampk activation. according to the literature, this is true for
yeast but, unexpectedly, not for mammalian cells on the basis of
the use of aicar, a pharmacological activator of ampk. in the
present study, carried out with hepatocytes, ht-29 cells, and
helacells,wehavereexaminedthepossibleroleofampkinthe
control of mammalian autophagy. inhibition of ampk activity
by compound c or by transfection with a dominant negative
form of ampk almost completely inhibited autophagy. these
results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by aicar is not
related to its ability to activate ampk. we conclude that in
mammalian cells, as in yeast, ampk is required for autophagy.
during macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autoph-
agy), a small part of the cytoplasm is sequestered by a double
isolation membrane, presumably derived from the endoplas-
mic reticulum, to form an autophagosome. this autophago-
some then fuses with a lysosome and the sequestered macro-
molecular material,
is degraded. the
process is activated by various stress situations, including nutri-
ent depletion. under these conditions, autophagy provides the
constituents required to maintain the metabolism essential for
survival (1, 2). an example is that of the mammalian liver in
which autophagy is accelerated during fasting to provide amino
acids for gluconeogenesis to meet the energy requirements of
the brain and of erythrocytes.
including proteins,
in many cell types, including liver cells, autophagy is inhib-
ited by amino acids, in synergy with insulin, and this inhibition
is mediated, at least in part, by mtor3-dependent signaling (1).

3 the abbreviations used are: mtor, mammalian target of rapamycin; aicar,
aica riboside, imidazole-4-carboxamide-1-␤-ribofuranoside; zmp, aicar
monophosphate; 3-ma, 3-methyladenine; ampk, amp-activated protein
depending on the cell type and the conditions, other signaling
pathways, such as the ras/raf/mapk signaling pathway, may
also participate in amino acid control of autophagy (1). in addi-
tion, autophagy is controlled by phosphatidylinositol phospho-
lipids. the process is inhibited by ptdins(3,4,5)p3, the product
of pi3k class i, a lipid kinase located upstream of mtor in the
insulin signaling pathway. by contrast, pi(3)p, the product of
pi3k class iii, is essential for autophagy (1, 3, 4). this require-
ment for pi(3)p explains why pi3k inhibitors are also autoph-
agy inhibitors.
the classical autophagy inhibitor
3-methyladenine (5) turned out to be a pi3k inhibitor (1).
indeed,
after the original observation in 1995 that amino acids can
stimulate mtor-dependent signaling (6), it is now generally
accepted that the mtor pathway acts as a sensor of amino
acids (7). a few years ago we, and others, discovered that mtor
can also sense changes in the cellular energy state via amp-
activated protein kinase (ampk). activation of this protein
kinase inhibits mtor-dependent signaling and inhibits pro-
tein synthesis (8), which is consistent with ampk function of
switching off atp-dependent processes (9).
inhibition of mtor by ampk, like that caused by addition of
rapamycin (1, 2), may be expected to increase autophagy. how-
ever, in the literature there is controversy on this issue. in yeast,
activation of ampk stimulates autophagy (10). by contrast,
activation of ampk by addition of the cell-permeable nucleo-
tide analogue aica riboside (aicar) in hepatocytes strongly
inhibits autophagy (11). in the present study, using different
mammalian cell types, we have examined the possible role of
ampk in the control of autophagy in more detail. our data
indicate that ampk, like in yeast, is required for autophagy.

hepatocytes
hepatocytes were isolated from male wistar rats (250–
300 g) starved for 16–20 h by collagenase perfusion (6).
hepatocytes (5 mg dry weight/ml) were incubated for the
indicated times at 37 °c in minimal medium (krebs-hense-
leit bicarbonate buffer plus 10 mm na⫹-hepes, ph 7.4, and
20 mm glucose) plus the components as indicated in the leg-
ends. the final incubation volume was 2 ml. the gas atmo-
sphere was o2/co2 (19:1, v/v).
at the end of the incubations, hepatocytes were collected for
gel analysis by centrifugation in 5 volumes of an ice-cold solu-
tion of 150 mm nacl plus 10 mm sodium hepes (ph 7.4) for 5 s
in an eppendorf centrifuge. for the sds-page procedures, the
pellet was lysed by addition of laemmli sample buffer and sub-
sequently incubated at 95 °c for 5 min.
for determination of atp, lactate, and amino acids, an ali-
quot of the incubated cell suspension was acidified with hclo4
(final concentration, 3%, m/v). after removal of the precipi-
tated protein by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (1 min;
10,000 ⫻ g), the clear supernatant was neutralized to ph 7 with
a small volume of a mixture of 2 m koh plus 0.3 m mops.
cell culture
ht-29 human colon cancer cells and hela cells were main-
tained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium 4.5 g/liter glu-
cose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% peni-
cillin/streptomycin solution. medium was replaced three times
per week, and cells were passaged at confluency. the cells were
grown in a humidified atmosphere of 10% co2, 90% air at 37 °c.
cells were plated and grown to 50–80% confluency before
treatment for different times with vehicle or adequate concen-
trations of amino acids (4⫻), rapamycin (100 nm), metformin
(1–10 mm), 3-methyladenine (3-ma) (10 mm), il-13 (30
ng/ml), and aicar (0.1–1 mm).
determination of atp, lactate, aicar, and zmp
atp was determined fluorimetrically with nadp⫹, glucose,
hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (13). lac-
tate was measured spectrophotometrically with nad⫹ and lac-
tate dehydrogenase (13). aicar and zmp were measured by
hplc as described by samari and seglen (11).
transfection
the expression constructs pegfp-c1-lkb1wt, pcdna3-
flag-strad, pcdna3-myc-ampkca, pcdna3-myc-
ampkdn, and control vectors were introduced into ht-29
cells and hela cells using lipofectaminetm 2000 and the
fugene 6tm reagent transfection kit, respectively. trans-
fected cells were cultured in complete medium for 48 h before
use for the different experiments. expression levels of each con-
struct were determined by sds-page analysis using the rele-
vant tag antibody.
immunoblotting
after sds-page resolution, the proteins were transferred
on nitrocellulose membrane. the membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk in tbst (10 mm tris-hcl, ph 8; 100
mm nacl; 0.1% tween 20) fo r 1 h atroom temperature and then
incubated with appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °c
(diluted in tbst-5% bsa), followed by incubation with horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000
dilution in tbst-5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h atroom tempera-
ture. the anti-actin was used at 1:2500 dilution in tbst-5%
bsa. all other total antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution in
tbst-5% bsa, and anti-phosphoantibodies were diluted at
1:1000 in tbst-1% bsa. the anti-c-myc were used at 1:200
dilution in tbst-5% bsa. the anti-flag was used at 1:1000
dilution. to quantify the different spots of immunoblotting, we
used the freeware scion imaging.
autophagic parameters
amino acid analysis—amino acids were analyzed with
hplc exactly as described by (14). of the branched chain
amino acids, the valine peak in the amino acid spectrum was
contaminated with a compound of unknown origin, and was
therefore not used.
[14c]chloroquine accumulation—accumulation of the diva-
lent weak base chloroquine, which monitors changes in the ph
of intracellular acidic compartments, mainly lysosomes, was
measured exactly as described elsewhere (15). in these experi-
ments, the hepatocyte concentration was 1 mg dw/ml, the con-
centration of chloroquine was ⬍1 ␮m and the amount of radio-
activity was 0.025 ␮ci/ml of incubation medium.
measurement of the degradation of long-lived proteins—
proteolysis was determined as described previously (16).

the last 10 min 0.1 ␮m mdc was
added. cells were then washed by
three rinses with pbs⫹ and fixed
with a solution of 3% paraformal-

effect of pharmacological modulators of ampk activity on
autophagic proteolysis in isolated rat hepatocytes—when
hepatocytes are incubated in the absence of amino acids, auto-
phagic proteolytic flux is maximal. as previously reported in
ref. 11, addition of the ampk activator aicar under these
conditions strongly inhibited autophagy, as indicated by the

control of macroautophagy by amp-activated protein kinase
large reduction in the appearance of the branched chain amino
acids isoleucine and leucine (which are not further catabolized
in rat liver) (fig. 1, a and b). this was also accompanied by
reductions in the major gluconeogenic amino acids aspartate,
glutamate, glutamine, and alanine (fig. 1, c–f). it should be
stressed that these experiments were carried out in the pres-
ence of a low concentration of cycloheximide (10 ␮m) to pre-
vent reincorporation of the proteolytically formed amino acids
into protein. the inhibition of proteolysis by aicar was simi-
lar to that observed with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylad-
enine and also to that observed with the acidotropic agent
methylamine, which inhibits lysosomal function by raising the
lysosomal ph (fig. 1, a and b).
administration of the antidiabetic agent metformin is
another way to stimulate ampk activity (18). the effects of
aicar and metformin on ampk phosphorylation are com-
pared in fig. 2. in the presence of aicar (250 ␮m), phos-
phorylation of ampk was rapid but decreased after 40 min,
presumably because continuous intracellular accumulation
of zmp results in zmp levels high enough to inhibit ampk
(19). by contrast, in the presence of 2 mm metformin, ampk
phosphorylation was initially slow (at 40 min it was similar to
that seen with aicar at 20 min) and increased with time to
a maximum at 80 min. even though 2 mm metformin was
more potent than aicar in stimulating ampk phosphoryl-
ation, the ability of metformin to inhibit autophagic produc-
tion of the branched-chain amino acids was less than that
observed with aicar (fig. 1, a and b). furthermore, pro-
duction of glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate was not sig-
nificantly affected by metformin while that of alanine was
even substantially increased (fig. 1, c–f), presumably
because glycolytic flux increased in the presence of met-
formin (see below).
figure 2. effect of aicar and metformin on ampk phosphorylation in
hepatocytes. hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of 20 mm glucose
for the times indicated, in the absence or presence of 250 ␮m aicar or 2 mm
metformin.
while aicar and metformin are ampk activators, we also
wanted to study the effect of inhibition of ampk activity on
autophagy. compound c has been reported as a specific inhib-
itor of ampk (18), and we examined its efficacy in this regard.
metformin-stimulated phosphorylation of ampk was
reversed by compound c (fig. 3). compound c did not inhibit
aicar-stimulated ampk phosphorylation unless amino acids
were also present (fig. 4) (see “discussion”). the same was true
for acetyl-coa carboxylase (acc), which is a substrate for
ampk (fig. 4). it was shown previously that compound c, in
addition to its action as an inhibitor of ampk (18), can also
inhibit ampk activity by competing with aicar transport
across the plasma membrane, thus affecting intracellular con-
version of aicar to zmp (20). this was confirmed in table 1
showing that 40 ␮m compound c partly inhibited both aicar
consumption and zmp production. interestingly, zmp forma-
tion was also inhibited by amino acid addition, but in this case
without significant effect on aicar consumption so that the
amino acid effect must have been intracellular rather than at
the level of aicar transport. the presence of both compound
c and amino acids inhibited zmp production by about 90%
(table 1). this accounts for the low ampk phosphorylation
and ampk activity, as indicated by acetyl coa carboxylase
phosphorylation (fig. 4), under these conditions (see further
“discussion”).
aicar inhibited amino acid-stimulated, rapamycin-sensi-
tive, phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase, in agreement with our
earlier observations (21). this effect was largely prevented by 40
␮m compound c (fig. 4). aicar alone slightly stimulated
p70s6 kinase phosphorylation (fig. 4), in agreement with the
data of moller et al. (22) who showed that this phosphorylation
was rapamycin-insensitive.
having thus established that compound c can inhibit ampk
activity in intact hepatocytes, whether by a direct effect on the
enzyme or indirectly by competing with aicar for transport
into the cells (20), we tested its effect on autophagy. if ampk
activation inhibits autophagy as suggested (11), one would
expect compound c to be able to reverse the inhibition of auto-
phagy by metformin. unexpectedly, however, compound c
inhibited autophagic proteolysis when added alone and the
effect was not additive with either that of metformin, aicar, or
3-methyladenine (fig. 1, a and b).
to rule out the possibility that compound c inhibited the
lysosomal proton pump, we tested its effect on the intracellular
accumulation of [14c]chloroquine, a divalent weak base, which
when present at low concentrations greatly accumulates in
acidic intracellular compartments, mainly lysosomes (15). as a
control, the effect of 5 mm methylamine was also tested. chlo-
roquine accumulation was not affected by compound c (fig. 5),
but methylamine greatly reduced it,
as expected. aicar significantly
decreased chloroquine accumula-
tion although not to the same extent
as methylamine, whereas met-
formin had no significant effect.

we also examined whether varia-
tions in glycolysis were in some
way associated with the observed

changes in autophagic proteolysis, but this was not the case.
omission of glucose did not affect autophagic proteolysis (fig.
1, a and b) and lactate was not formed under these conditions
(fig. 1g). atp levels and ampk phosphorylation were not
affected by glucose depletion (not shown), presumably because
mitochondrial oxidation of endogenous fatty acids provided
sufficient energy. metformin stimulated, while both aicar
and 3-methyladenine strongly inhibited production of lactate;
compound c, on the other hand, had no effect on lactate for-
mation (fig. 1g). the effect of metformin on the production of
lactate is consistent with the ability of this compound to act as a
weak inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (23, 24).
indeed, we observed a decrease in intracellular atp levels from

incubation in the presence of 2 mm metformin (n ⫽ 5; p ⬍ 0.05)

3-methyladenine is in agreement with previous observations in
hepatocytes (25, 26).

in the course of our experiments, we noted that aicar
inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase
b, which was prevented by amino acids but not by compound c
(fig. 4). these data indicate that, in addition to activating
ampk, aicar may have other effects (see “discussion”).
inhibition of ampk activity blocks autophagic proteolysis
in human cell lines—we have previously shown that auto-
phagic proteolysis is stimulated when the human colon car-
cinoma ht-29 cells are incubated in nutrient-free medium
(4). pilot experiments showed that metformin and aicar
were able to activate ampk in ht-29 cells, as determined by
its phosphorylation at position thr172 and phosphorylation
of its substrate acc at position ser79, with a maximal effect
at 250 ␮m aicar and 2 mm metformin (fig. 6a and data not
shown). whatever the concentration used, cell viability was
greater than 95% under the experimental conditions used in
this study. following on with these results, we next investi-
gated the effect of aicar and metformin on the degradation
of long-lived [14c]valine-labeled proteins. both compounds
inhibited the degradation of [14c]valine-labeled proteins in
nutrient-free medium to the same extent (fig. 6b). however,
only a partial inhibition of proteolysis was observed when
compared with 3-ma, amino acids or interleukin 13, known
inhibitors of autophagic proteolysis in ht-29 cells (4) (fig.
6b). to correlate these findings with the state of ampk acti-
vation, ht-29 cells were transfected with a constitutively
active form of ampk (ampkca). as previously shown (27),
ampk activity was increased, as determined here by the
phosphorylation of the ampk substrate acc,
in cells

rate of degradation of long-lived [14c]valine-labeled pro-
teins and its sensitivity to autophagy inhibitors were similar
to that observed in untransfected ht-29 cells (fig. 6b) and in
cells transfected with an empty vector (data not shown)
when incubated in nutrient-free medium. from these find-
ings we reasoned that the inhibition of ampk activity should

rate of degradation of long-lived [14c]valine-labeled pro-
teins in the presence of compound c (40 ␮m). prior to this,
we verified the inhibitory effect of compound c on ampk
activity in ht-29 cells. for this purpose, ht-29 cells were
cultured in the absence of glucose, a condition known to
activate ampk and to favor the phosphorylation of its sub-
strate acc (fig. 6a). in the presence of compound c, acc
phosphorylation was inhibited by 80% in treated cells when
compared with untreated cells. in agreement with the find-
ings in hepatocytes (cf. fig. 1), compound c inhibited prote-
olysis to the same extent as autophagic proteolysis inhibitors
in ht-29 cells (fig. 6b). in addition, no additive inhibition
was observed in the presence of both compound c and 3-ma
(data not shown). from these findings we concluded that the
inhibition of ampk activity blocks autophagic proteolysis
whereas active ampk is required during starvation-induced
autophagy. to exclude a cell line-dependent effect, we have
next investigated the role of ampk during autophagic pro-
teolysis in another cell line, hela cells. in this cell line, which
does not express the ampk kinase lkb1 (28), aicar is not
able to stimulate ampk unless lkb1 is expressed (fig. 8b
and ref. 29). lkb1 is present in a complex with the regula-
tory proteins strad and mo25 (29). as the amount of
strad is low in hela cells (29), we co-transfected hela
cells with cdnas encoding lkb1 and strad (fig. 8a). in
transfected cells we observed an increase in ampk activity,
which was further stimulated in the presence of aicar (fig.
8b and ref. 29). next we have analyzed the rate of degrada-
tion of long-lived [14c]valine-labeled proteins in cells trans-
fected with cdnas encoding lkb1 and strad and in con-
trol hela cells (cells transfected with empty vectors). as
shown in fig. 8c, in both cell lines amino acid- and 3-ma-
sensitive autophagic proteolysis was stimulated in hbss.
however, no significative difference in the rate of starvation-
stimulated autophagic proteolysis was observed depending
on the activity of ampk. although the activity of ampk was
not stimulated by aicar, an inhibitory effect of aicar on
autophagic proteolysis was still observed (fig. 8c). next we
analyzed the effect of inhibition of ampk activity on the rate
of proteolysis. in a first series of experiments, hela cells
expressing lkb1 and strad were transfected with the
cdna encoding ampkdn (fig. 8a). under these conditions,
we observed a decrease in ampk activity and no stimulatory
effect of aicar (fig. 8b). we observed an almost complete
inhibition of starvation-induced autophagic degradation of
long-lived [14c]valine-labeled proteins in these cells (fig.
8c). we then investigated the effect of compound c in hela
cells and in cells expressing lkb1 and strad. compound c
inhibited ampk activity in hela cells expressing lkb1 and
strad and also in control hela cells, which have a low but
detectable ampk activity (fig. 8b). in agreement with the
results obtained in hepatocytes and ht-29 cells, compound
c was a very potent inhibitor of starvation-induced autoph-
agic proteolysis in hela cells, independent of the amount of
lkb1 and strad (fig. 8c). as autophagy is a vacuolar
mechanism that sequesters cytoplasmic material to deliver it
to the lysosomal compartment, we have investigated the
presence of autophagic vacuoles by staining with mdc, a dye

approaches. in a first approach, cells were transfected with
the cdna encoding a dominant-negative form of ampk
(ampkdn). in a second approach, cells were treated with
compound c. according to previous results (27), activation
of ampk activity by aicar was impaired in cells expressing
ampkdn (fig. 7a). moreover starvation-induced proteoly-
sis was inhibited in these cells when compared with untrans-
fected cells (fig. 6b), to cells expressing ampkca (fig. 7b)
and to cells transfected with an empty vector (data not

suggest that inhibition of ampk

lation of autophagy in nutrient-

discussion
we have been able to confirm the
observation of samari and seglen
(11) that aicar is a very effective
inhibitor of autophagy in hepato-
cytes. it was proposed (11) that
aicar, after its intracellular phos-
phorylation to zmp, inhibits auto-
phagy because of its ability to acti-
vate ampk. because autophagy is
accelerated when cells have insuffi-
cient oxidizable substrate at their
disposal, inhibition of autophagy by
ampk activation under these con-
ditions would, however, be counter-
productive (1).
in hepatocytes, ampk activity
did not match the inhibition of
autophagy. our experiments show
that metformin, even though it
strongly stimulated ampk phos-
phorylation, was less potent as an
autophagy inhibitor. the partial
inhibition of autophagy by met-
formin may have been caused by the
significant decline in cellular atp
levels that was observed under these
conditions. indeed, a decrease in
atp alone,
in the absence of
changes in ampk activity, has pre-
viously been shown by moller et al.
(32) to inhibit autophagy. conse-
quently, when nutrient depletion is
too excessive, with strong reduction
in intracellular atp, autophagy
may become inhibited because,
after all, autophagy is a complicated membrane flow-depend-
ent process, which does require input of atp (33).
the fact that the ampk inhibitor compound c strongly
inhibited autophagy, not only in hepatocytes but also in ht-29
cells and hela cells, suggested that activated ampk, rather
than inhibiting autophagy is in fact required for autophagy, a
situation similar to that in yeast (10). this was supported by the
experiments with ht-29 cells and hela cells showing that
transfection of these cells with ampkdn completely inhibited
autophagy in hbss. by contrast, transfection with ampkca
did not affect the rate of autophagy under these conditions. we

that accumulates in acidic compartments including autoph-
agic vacuoles (30, 31). as expected, mdc-positive vacuoles
accumulated in hela cells expressing lkb1 and strad
when incubated fo r 2 h innutrient-free medium (fig. 9).
according to previous studies (31), the number of mdc-
positive vacuoles was reduced by 80–85% in cells incubated
in nutrient-free medium in the presence of 3-ma or amino
acids (fig. 9). the same qualitative and quantitative obser-
vations were also made in control hela cells (data not
shown). however, expression of ampkdn in hela cells
expressing lkb1 and strad reduced by 65–70% the num-

the fact that in hela cells, which
lack lkb1, autophagy can be inhib-
ited by compound c (fig. 8) leads us
to conclude that, apparently, ampk
can also be phosphorylated by
another upstream kinase. major
candidates are camkk and tak1
(38–40).
rather zmp),
for autophagy (4).
the question to be answered
now is why autophagy is inhibited
by aicar. presumably, the inhibi-
tion of autophagy by aicar is not
related to its ability to activate
ampk. one possibility is that
aicar (or
like
3-methyladenine,
is also a pi3k
inhibitor which inhibits both pi3k
class i and iii, the latter being
essential
in
pi3k class iii-overexpressed chi-
nese hamster ovary cells aicar
strongly inhibited pi3k class iii
activity, although the effect was
assumed to be due to activation of
ampk (41). the observation that
insulin-induced phosphorylation of
protein kinase b was antagonised by
aicar (fig. 4), which has also been
reported by others (42–44), may be
explained by pi3k inhibition. in
macrophages, aicar has been
directly shown to inhibit pi3k (43).
in this context, it is important to
note that caffeine and theophylline,
derivatives of the purine xanthine,
are also inhibitors of pi3k, albeit
only at high concentrations (45).

conclude from these experiments that ampk is essential for
autophagy and that, apparently, basal activity of ampk is suf-
ficient for autophagy.
our findings are in line with recent data showing that activa-
tion of the tumor suppressor p53 inhibits mtor activity
through activation of ampk, a phenomenon that is accompa-
nied by increased autophagy (34, 35). our data also tally with
the recently demonstrated requirement of autophagy for
eukaryotic elongation factor 2-kinase (eef-2 kinase) (36),
which is known to be activated by ampk (37).
there are other observations that
suggest that aicar may not be spe-
cific as an activator of ampk but
can exert other actions. thus,
aicar was found to inhibit glycol-
ysis in hepatocytes (fig. 1g). this
effect, which has been reported pre-
viously (26, 46),
is highly unex-
pected because activation of ampk
should stimulate rather than inhibit
glycolysis which, after all, is an atp-
producing process. indeed, activation of ampk with met-
formin was accompanied by increased production of lactate
(fig. 1g).
another effect of aicar, not related to ampk activation
because metformin had no effect, was its ability to raise the
lysosomal ph (fig. 5), perhaps due to the amine group in its
chemical structure. although acidotropic agents may not
affect the rate of formation of autophagosomes (6, 47), they
do inhibit the degradation of protein (and of other macro-
molecules) within the autophagolysosome. although aicar

finally, we would like to comment on the finding that not
only compound c but also amino acids are able to inhibit
zmp production from aicar, albeit by a different mecha-
nism, so that zmp production was almost completely
blocked in the presence of both compound c and amino
acids (table 1). these observations underscore the warning
(20) that variations in the activity of ampk in the presence
of aicar are not always due to direct effects on ampk.
although ampk is activated by zmp, high concentrations of
zmp have been shown to inhibit the enzyme (19) and makes the
effect of a partial decrease in intracellular zmp on ampk dif-
ficult to predict. the ability of compound c, in contrast to
amino acids, to inhibit aicar-induced ampk phosphoryla-
tion in hepatocytes on its own (fig. 4), even though the accu-
mulation of zmp in both cases decreased similarly (table 1)
may be ascribed to small differences in intra/extracellular dis-
tribution of zmp. although most of the zmp produced from
aicar is recovered inside the hepatocytes (50), it is possible
that in the presence of amino acids, when cell volume increases
(8), some of the zmp leaks to the extracellular fluid so that the
total amount of zmp in the cell suspension overestimates the
actual concentration of zmp inside the cells.
in summary, the data presented in this study confirm that the
ampk activator aicar inhibits autophagy but do not support
the conclusion that ampk is responsible for this effect (11).
rather, our observations indicate that ampk activation is
required for autophagy, a situation similar to that in yeast (10).

has been widely used in studies of the role of ampk in
metabolism (9), clearly not all effects of aicar can be
ascribed to its ability to activate ampk.
we realize that part of the evidence that ampk is essential
for autophagy relies on the use of compound c and its assumed
specificity. compound c was originally described as a specific
inhibitor of ampk activity (18) but more recent reports
showed that ampk phosphorylation itself can also be affected
by compound c (cf. also fig. 4) (48, 49). apart from an effect of
compound c on the conversion of aicar to zmp (20) (cf.
table 1), which can be considered as an indirect way of inhib-
iting ampk activity, we have no indications that the inhibition
of autophagy by compound c was due to effects other than that
on ampk. moreover, an effect of compound c on the lysoso-
mal ph could be ruled out (fig. 5).
