we performed a genome-wide association study of 19,779
nonsynonymous snps in 735 individuals with crohn disease
and 368 controls. a total of 7,159 of these snps were
informative. we followed up on all 72 snps with p r 0.01
with an allele-based disease association test in 380 independent
crohn disease trios, 498 crohn disease singleton cases and
1,032 controls. disease association of rs2241880 in the
autophagy-related 16-like 1 gene (atg16l1) was replicated in
these samples (p ¼ 4.0  10–8) and conﬁrmed in a uk case-
control sample (p ¼ 0.0004). by haplotype and regression
analysis, we found that marker rs2241880, a coding snp
(t300a), carries virtually all the disease risk exerted by the
atg16l1 locus. the atg16l1 gene encodes a protein in the
autophagosome pathway that processes intracellular bacteria.
we found a statistically signiﬁcant interaction with respect to
crohn disease risk between rs2241880 and the established
card15 susceptibility variants (p ¼ 0.039). together with the
lack of association between rs2241880 and ulcerative colitis
(p 4 0.4), these data suggest that the underlying biological
process may be speciﬁc to crohn disease.
relative sibling risk (ls) as estimated in individuals of western
european origin (15–35),
less than 30% of the sibling recurrence
risk seems to be explicable by known mutations.
we genotyped a total of 19,779 coding snps in panel a (735
individuals with crohn disease and 368 controls from northern
germany; table 1) using the snplex genotyping system. genotyping
was successful for 16,360 assays, with ‘success’ deﬁned as a mean
ﬂuorescence reading 4500 units on the abi 3730xl sequencer. of the
successfully genotyped snps, 7,159 had a minor allele frequency z1%
and were included in the subsequent analyses. next, we evaluated
those markers with p r 0.01 in the allele-based test for disease
association (n ¼ 72) in panel b (380 german crohn disease trios, 498
singleton affected individuals and 1,032 independent controls; table 2
and supplementary table 1 online). when we used p r 0.05 as

sequence variations associated with crohn disease have been reported
for several genes, including card15 (also known as nod2; refs. 1,2),
slc22a4 and slc22a5 within the 5q31 haplotype3,4; dlg5 (ref. 5);
abcb1 (also known as mdr1; refs. 6–8); card4 (also known as
nod1; ref. 9); tnfsf15 (ref. 10) and il23r (ref. 11). the most
consistent replication and the clearest functional data are available for
card15 (refs. 12–16). if the cumulated relative risk exerted by all

the samples are organized into panels that make up successive steps of the study.
index cases from trios were also used in the case-control analyses so that, for example,
a total of 878 affected individuals (498 + 380) were available for the case-control
comparison in panel b. athe controls from crohn disease panel b were also used for the
analysis of ulcerative colitis.

indication of formal replication in both the transmission disequili-
brium test (tdt) and the case-control comparison of panel b, only
(i) rs2241880 (t300a) in the atg16l1 gene, (ii) the two previously
reported variants rs1050152 (l503f) in the slc22a4 gene4 and
(iii) rs2066845 (‘snp12’; ref. 1) in card15 matched this criterion.
card15 variant rs2066844 (also known as ‘snp8’) failed genotyping;
rs2066847 (‘snp13’) was not part of the coding snp (csnp) panel
because the necessary insertion or deletion (indel) design was not
feasible on the snplex v1.0 platform. association of the g allele of
rs2241880 with crohn disease was signiﬁcant in both the allele-based
case-control comparison (p ¼ 1.6  10–5) and the tdt (p ¼ 2.7 
10–5). we conﬁrmed genotyping results obtained with snplex using
taqman (99.8% genotype concordance), thereby excluding a technical
artifact. we did not observe any signiﬁcant differences in terms of age
of onset,
frequency of ileal disease, stenoses or ﬁstulae between
different genotypes (p 4 0.5; supplementary table 2 online).
we searched for additional mutations in the atg16l1 gene by
resequencing all exons, splice sites and the promoter region in the
genomic dna of 47 individuals with crohn disease. we did not
identify any other coding or splice site variants besides rs2241880. in
panel b, we genotyped 28 tagging snps (r 2 4 0.8, minor allele
frequency z1%; supplementary fig. 1 online) selected from the ceu
hapmap sample (which comprises utah residents with ancestry from
northern and western europe) (supplementary table 3 online). we
found that the intronic snp rs2289472 had the same minor allele
frequency (0.47) as coding snp rs2241880, and it yielded a slightly
more signiﬁcant disease association (p ¼ 1.4  10–5). marker
rs2289472 is localized 1,082 bp upstream of exon 9 and is not part
of any recognized regulatory motif. in a logistic regression analysis,
none of the 28 tagging snps signiﬁcantly improved the model ﬁt
in the presence of rs2241880 (all p 4 0.05). taken together with

snps included in the analysis are marked by asterisks in supplementary figure 1 to illustrate their block assignment. all analyses were carried out using cocaphase or
tdtphase30. p values refer to the null hypothesis of either equal haplotype frequencies (cocaphase) or of a transmission–to–non-transmission ratio equal to 0.5 (tdtphase).
fcases and fcontrols represent haplotype frequency among affected individuals and controls, respectively. ftransmitted and fnon-transmitted represent haplotype frequency on transmitted
chromosomes and nontransmitted chromosomes, respectively. nonsynonymous snp rs2241880 is highlighted in bold, and the risk allele is underlined. obviously, the sole risk
haplotype (acagcaagtgcg) is fully signiﬁed by rs2241880 allele g; all other haplotypes carry allele a (note that the case-control–based ors were normalized so that or ¼ 1.0 for
haplotype 1). this haplotype pattern strongly suggests that rs2241880 is indeed the major risk variant at the atg16l1 locus.
supplementary fig. 1), these ﬁndings suggest that the crohn disease
risk conferred by atg16l1 gene variation is probably conﬁned to
individuals carrying susceptibility allele g at rs2241880. in the
combined analysis of panels a and b, odds ratios (ors) were 1.45
(95% conﬁdence interval (c.i.): 1.21–1.74) for carrying allele g
(population attributable risk (par) ¼ 0.26) and 1.77 (95% c.i.:
1.43–2.18) for homozygosity (par ¼ 0.17). the frequency of the
g allele was 0.60 in affected individuals and 0.53 in controls.
we also replicated the crohn disease association of rs2242880 in a
sample from the uk (panel c) using an independent taqman assay.
the british data yielded p ¼ 0.0004 in the allele-based test (or: 1.35;
95% c.i.: 1.14–1.59) and p ¼ 0.0002 in the genotype-based test (or
for homozygosity for allele g: 1.71; 95% c.i.: 1.23–2.39). the
frequency of the g allele (59% among affected individuals, 52%
among controls) was similar to that in the german sample.
some of the variants listed in table 2 or supplementary table 1
may still represent important candidates for disease susceptibility. the
requirement of a signiﬁcant replication (p r0.05) in both the tdt
and the case-control comparison may have led to the exclusion of
relevant variants owing to a lack of power. although the present study
still fell short of comprehensively assessing all putatively functional
table 4 analysis of the statistical interaction between atg16l1 snp rs2241880 and
card15 genotype
variation in the human genome, our results, together with those of
other recent studies17, demonstrate that direct association analysis
using csnps is a meaningful complement for genome-wide linkage
disequilibrium–based association studies like the ones reported for
crohn disease10,11. the coding variant rs11209026 in il23r (ref. 11)
was not part of the csnp panel and thus was not detected in this
study. weak linkage evidence to the atg16l1 (2q37.1) region has been
found in some genome scans: lod ¼ 1.0 was reported in ref. 18 at the
190 cm position, and lod ¼ 1.2 was obtained at 180 cm in the
german and uk genome scan19. notably, in the published reanalysis20
of the german and uk scan, the 2q lod peak increased to 1.5 in
families with wild-type card15.
frequencies of rs2241880 allele g in individuals with ulcerative
colitis (0.54) and in controls (0.53) were virtually identical. thus, we
did not obtain evidence for a disease association either from the
case-control comparison (p 4 0.4) or the tdt (p 4 0.9) for
ulcerative colitis.
dd
we investigated the disease-associated variants in atg16l1 and
card15 for statistical interaction with respect to crohn disease risk.
we classiﬁed individuals in the german panel b either homozygous
wild-type (dd), heterozygous carrier (dd) or homozygous carrier
(dd, which included compound heterozy-
gotes) for the three main causative card15
snps (rs2066844, rs2066845 and rs2066847),
as suggested21. the frequencies and ors of
individual card15 risk genotypes, stratiﬁed
by rs2241880 genotype, are shown in table 4.
a statistical
interaction became apparent
between rs2241880 and the card15 low-risk
genotypes dd and dd. the or difference was
signiﬁcant
genotype gg
(2.03 on dd background versus 1.04 for dd;
breslow-day w2 ¼ 4.267, 1 degree of freedom,
p ¼ 0.039) but not
the
atg16l1 variant rs2241880 is a risk factor
even in the absence of card15 mutations. on
the background of card15 high-risk geno-
type dd,
the risk conferred by carrying
rs2241880 allele g seemed to be higher than
in the presence of dd or dd, but the con-
ﬁdence intervals of the respective ors were
still wide owing to the small number of dd
controls (table 4). nevertheless, when we
combined rs2241880 genotypes gg and ag,
the joint or of 5.89 (95% c.i.: 1.23–29.21) was
signiﬁcantly larger than unity (fisher’s exact

atg16l1
β-actin
figure 1 expression and cellular localization of the atg16l1 gene product.
amounts of atg16l1 protein are inﬂuenced neither by the rs2241880
genotype nor by intestinal inﬂammation. (a) expression of atg16l1 in a
set of different tissues as detected by rt-pcr (iec, intestinal epithelial
cells). the corresponding b-actin control (with a 518-bp amplicon size) is
given below. (b) amounts of atg16l1 in colonic mucosal biopsy
specimens. proteins (15 mg) from rectal mucosal biopsies of crohn disease
patients and normal controls (n) were separated by denaturing sds-page,
transferred onto polyvinylidine ﬂuoride (pvdf) membranes and probed for
the presence of atg16l1 using a speciﬁc primary antibody and horseradish
peroxidase–coupled secondary antibody. the abundant 68.2-kda band
corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of the isoform encoded by
genbank ay398617 (uniprot accession number q676u5). this major
protein form was used for three-dimensional modeling of the atg16l1
protein (fig. 2). the 48.5-kda band corresponds to genbank ef079890,
which contains exon 9 (harboring rs2241880) in the same reading frame
as the major form. (c–i) representative immunohistochemistry results (out
of six normal controls and six individuals with crohn disease) from colonic
mucosal tissue samples from normal controls for genotype aa (c) and
gg (f) and individuals with crohn disease for genotype aa (d) and gg (g)
are shown to demonstrate the cellular localization of the atg16l1 protein.
cellular expression patterns in mononuclear cells (h) and intestinal
epithelial cells (i) of a crohn disease sample (rs2241880aa) are shown at
higher magniﬁcation. e shows a crohn disease sample without the primary
antibody, used as a control. bar represents 10 mm in c–g.
two-sided p ¼ 0.016), thereby conﬁrming that rs2241880 allele g is a
risk factor on a high-risk card15 genotype background as well.
larger studies will be needed to determine the exact nature of the
statistical interaction between the atg16l1 and card15 variants
and to obtain narrower conﬁdence intervals, particularly for the
dd stratum.

we investigated expression of the atg16l1 gene by rt-pcr in a
tissue panel, conﬁrming expression in colon, small bowel, intestinal
epithelial cells and immune tissues like spleen and leukocytes (fig. 1a).
recently, multiple splice variants of atg16l1 have been reported22. in
all annotated and reported splice variants, exon 9, which contains the
crohn disease susceptibility variant rs2241880, is translated in the
same reading frame, thereby consistently leading to a threonine to
alanine substitution by the snp (fig. 1b). we detected expression
of atg16l1 in the intestinal epithelium by immunohistochemistry
(fig. 1c–i) and did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference in the amount or
pattern of expression in tissue from controls and affected individuals.
expression of atg16l1 was also independent of the rs2241880
genotype at both the protein and the cdna level (fig. 1b).
the exact functional consequences of rs2241880 remain tentative at
this point. the human atg16l1 protein has an n-terminal apg16
domain consisting of coiled coils and eight c-terminal wd repeats
(see three-dimensional model in fig. 2 and in silico protein analysis in
the supplementary note online). the variant leads to an amino acid
exchange (polar threonine to nonpolar alanine) at the evolutionarily
conserved position 300 of the n terminus of the wd-repeat domain
in atg16l1 (fig. 2). the interaction partner of this domain has not
yet been identiﬁed experimentally23. however, it is clear that atg16l1
is part of the autophagosome pathway. the established role of the
autophagosome in the processing of intracellular bacteria would
further support the emerging concept of crohn disease as an inﬂam-
matory barrier disorder. the lack of association with ulcerative colitis
and the statistical interaction with card15 suggest that the under-
lying biological processes may be disease speciﬁc.

methods
participants. recruitment details are given in supplementary methods online.
all participants gave written, informed consent, and the recruitment protocols
were approved by the ethics committees at the respective recruiting institutions.
genotyping using snplex and taqman technologies (applied biosystems) was
performed as described, using an automated laboratory setup24,25. for the
construction of the panel of 19,779 nonsynonymous snps, data from dbsnp
(build 117) were combined with polymorphisms discovered by the applera
exon resequencing and celera shotgun sequencing projects26 (see supplemen-
tary methods, supplementary table 4 online and the url noted below).
sequencing of genomic dna was performed using abi bigdye chemistry
(primer sequences are given in supplementary table 5 online). traces were
inspected for snps and indels using insnp27 and sequencher. standard
protocols were used for the isolation of epithelial cells, rt-pcr, protein blot
and immunohistochemistry (supplementary table 6 and supplementary
methods online).
statistical analysis. markers were tested for hardy-weinberg equilibrium in
controls before inclusion in the analyses (p 4 0.05). single-marker case-control
analyses and tdt were performed using haploview28 and genomizer29.
haplotype frequency estimates were obtained from singletons using coca-
phase30. signiﬁcance testing of haplotype frequency differences was per-
formed with cocaphase and tdtphase30. genotype-based logistic
regression analysis was performed with r, coding individual snp genotypes
as binary indicator variables. analysis of statistical interaction was carried out
using the freq procedure of sas.
accession codes. the genbank accession codes of the major splice variants of
atg16l1 are ay398617 and ef079890.
