summary
the etiologic agent of q fever coxiella burnetii, is an
intracellular obligate parasite that develops large
vacuoles with phagolysosomal characteristics, con-
taining multiple replicating bacteria. we have previ-
ously shown that phase ii c. burnetii replicative
vacuoles generated after 24–48 h post infection are
decorated with the autophagic protein lc3. the aim
of the present study was to examine, at earlier stages
of infection, the distribution and roles of the small
gtpases rab5 and rab7, markers of early and late
endosomes respectively, as well as of the protein lc3
on c. burnetii trafficking. our results indicate that: (i)
coxiella phagosomes (cph) acquire the two rab pro-
teins sequentially during infection; (ii) overexpres-
sion of a dominant negative mutant form of rab5, but
not of rab7, impaired coxiella entry, whereas both
rab5 and rab7 dominant negative mutants inhibited
vacuole formation;
(iii) cph colocalized with the
protein lc3 as early as 5 min after infection; acquisi-
tion of this protein appeared to be a bacterially driven
process, because it was inhibited by the bacterio-
static antibiotic chloramphenicol and (iv) c. burnetii
delayed the arrival of the typical lysosomal protease
cathepsin d to the cph, which delay is further
increased by starvation-induced autophagy. based
on our results we propose that c. burnetii transits

through the normal endo/phagocytic pathway but
actively interacts with autophagosomes at early times
after infection. this intersection with the autophagic
pathway delays fusion with the lysosomal compart-
ment possibly favouring the intracellular differentia-
tion and survival of the bacteria.
introduction
phagocytosis is the process that cells use to internalize
large particles such as mineral debris, apoptotic cells and
pathogens (aderem, 2002; vieira et al., 2002; stuart and
ezekowitz, 2005). in this process, the particle is loaded in
a relatively large membrane compartment called phago-
some which undergoes characteristic changes during its
transit, mainly by interaction with the endocytic pathway
(desjardins et al., 1994). using latex beads as a model, it
was demonstrated that several proteins are acquired by
phagosomes during their transport. many of these pro-
teins regulate fusion–ﬁssion events with other membrane
compartments. the family of small gtpases rab plays a
crucial role in membrane trafficking of eukaryotic cells,
regulating tethering, docking and fusion events among
different compartments (zerial and mcbride, 2001).
rab5 is the best characterized of the endosomal rab
proteins. it has been shown that this protein regulates
clathrin-coated vesicle formation, endosome motility and
early endosome fusion (nielsen et al., 1999; rubino et al.,
2000). rab5 also regulates the initial events in the phago-
cytic pathway (duclos et al., 2000; roberts et al., 2000).
numerous studies have demonstrated that the acquisition
of this protein by phagosomes can modulate the intracel-
lular fate of pathogens such as salmonella sp. and myco-
bacterium tuberculosis, (clemens and horwitz, 1996;
fratti et al., 2001). several rab5 interacting proteins have
been identiﬁed such as rabenosyn-5, rabaptin-5 and
rabex-5 (vieira et al., 2002). the early endosomal
antigen 1 (eea1) is a rab5 effector that regulate fusion
events between early endosomes and has been involved
in phagolysosome biogenesis (via et al., 1997; fratti
et al., 2001; vieira et al., 2001). microinjection of antibod-
ies against eea1 hampered the phagosomal acquisition
of late endocytic markers, such as lysophosphatidic acid
and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (fratti et al., 2001).
892 p. s. romano et al.
rab7 is another rab protein more speciﬁcally related
with degradative compartments such us late endosomes
and lysosomes (feng et al., 1995; vitelli et al., 1997).
several studies have demonstrated that rab7 is impor-
tant for the maintenance of the perinuclear lysosomal
compartment by controlling the aggregation and fusion
between late endocytic structures and lysosomes (papini
et al., 1997; bucci et al., 2000; cantalupo et al., 2001).
even though little is known about the later stages of
phagosomal maturation, it is believed that rab7 function
is needed for phagolysosome formation. indeed, in dicty-
ostelium a dominant negative rab7 mutant interfered with
phagosomal maturation (rupper et al., 2001). also, it has
been shown that in permeabilized macrophages at least
one rab protein, conceivably rab7,
is required in
phagosome–lysosome fusion because this process is
substantially inhibited by rab gdp dissociation inhibitor
(funato et al., 1997). the harsh environment of
the
phagolysosome, represented by the presence of hydro-
lytic enzymes such as cathepsin d and an extremely
acidic ph, contributes to death and degradation of the
internalized particle and provides a host defence against
intracellular pathogens.
autophagy is a physiological process required for the
removal of aged organelles and cytosolic components
(reviewed by klionsky and emr, 2000; yoshimori, 2004).
this pathway is important during cellular remodelling and
differentiation and is activated during cell stress or
damage by exposure to cytotoxins (dorn et al., 2002).
different groups have identiﬁed many molecules involved
in the autophagy process in both yeast and mammalian
cells (tsukada and ohsumi, 1993; thumm et al., 1994;
mizushima et al., 2001). the product of the yeast atg8
gene is a protein that is stimulated in response to nutrient
starvation (lang et al., 1998; kirisako et al., 1999). lc3 is
a mammalian homologue of the yeast atg8 and is tar-
geted to autophagosomal membranes after a post-
translational processing that involves the conjugation with
the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (kabeya et al., 2000).
like phagocytosis, autophagy is a lysosomal process
that ends
called
autophagolysosome. moreover, some endosomal pro-
teins like rab7 are indispensable during autophagosomal
maturation (gutierrez et al., 2004; jager et al., 2004),
indicating the interaction between endocytic and auto-
phagic pathways.
in a degradative compartment
a subset of bacterial pathogens invades the host cell
using classical phagocytosis to escape the dangerous
extracellular environment, evading the immune response.
several microorganisms manipulate the cell machinery in
their own beneﬁt establishing a replicative niche with
access to host nutrients (vieira et al., 2002). these suc-
cessful organisms have different strategies for intracellu-
lar survival. some microorganisms interfere with the
normal maturation of the phagosome to phagolysosomes
such as m. tuberculosis (sturgill-koszycki et al., 1994; via
et al., 1997) whereas others pathogens, such as listeria
monocytogenes (gouin et al., 1999) and trypanosoma
cruzi (ley et al., 1990), escape from the phagosome and
replicate in the cytosol. a third group of microorganisms
reside in autophagosome-like vacuoles. that is the case
of virulent legionella pneumophila (coers et al., 1999;
amer and swanson, 2005), porphyromonas gingivalis
(dorn et al., 2002) and brucella abortus (pizarro-cerda
et al., 1998).
forms:
coxiella burnetii, the aetiological agent of q fever in
humans, is an obligate intracellular microorganism that
invades and replicates in a wide range of cells lines, such
as ﬁbroblasts, epithelial cells and macrophages (heinzen
et al., 1999). this pleomorphic bacterium exists in two
morphological and developmental
the non-
replicating and more resistant small cell variant (scv) and
the vegetative and replicating large cell variant (lcv)
(heinzen et al., 1999; coleman et al., 2004). by 48 h post
infection, this gram negative bacterium develops a large
replicative vacuole [coxiella replicative vacuole (crv)]
with characteristics of typical phagolysosome (akporiaye
et al., 1983; heinzen et al., 1996). hydrolytic enzymes
like acid phosphatase and lysosomal ﬂuid phase markers
are found in crvs (heinzen et al., 1999; howe and mal-
lavia, 2000). our group has previously demonstrated that
the large, acidiﬁed crvs display autophagic features
(beron et al., 2002) and that the induction of autophagy
and overexpression of proteins involved in the autophagic
pathway favours the infection and generation of this cox-
iella replicative niche (gutierrez et al., 2005). therefore,
coxiella belongs to a group of bacteria that subverts the
autophagic pathway for their own beneﬁt. in a recent
report, we have presented evidence that incubation of
cells under starvation conditions causes a signiﬁcantly
increase in the percentage of lcv at 24 h after infection
(gutierrez and colombo, 2005). apparently the interaction
of crvs with autophagic vesicles provides key nutrients
required to trigger the morphological differentiation from
scv to lcv.
although certain characteristics about the biogenesis of
crv have been described (heinzen et al., 1999; coleman
et al., 2004), very little is known about the initial transport
steps of coxiella phagosomes (cph) and the relationship
between phagocytic and autophagic pathways at early
times after infection. in the present report we have studied
at a molecular level, the mechanisms that control the
transport and development of cph. here we demonstrate
that endocytic proteins such as rab5 and rab7 are
acquired by cph at very early times of infection. our
results indicate that although only rab5 favour coxiella
invasion, both proteins are required for the initial transport
events and for establishing the crv. moreover, we dem-

onstrate that lc3, the speciﬁc autophagosomal protein is
acquired as early as 5 min after infection and that this
recruitment is dependent on the microorganism protein
synthesis. furthermore, we show that c. burnetii delays
the acquisition of lysosomal enzymes by cph and that this
effect
is increased in cells subjected to starvation
conditions. taken together our results indicate that the
interaction with autophagic pathway occurs early during
infection and that this interaction, likely modulated by the
pathogen, favours coxiella infection by delaying fusion
with the lysosomal compartment.
results
coxiella burnetii phagosomes interact with endocytic
compartments at early times post infection
as indicated in the introduction, to date little is known
about the phagocytosis process of c. burnetii and the
early events post infection. the majority of the studies
have characterized the crv which is generated after
24–48 h post infection (akporiaye et al., 1983; heinzen
et al., 1996; 1999). in the present report we have explored
the early transport of cph and the relationship of this
pathogen with the phagocytic and autophagic pathways at
very short times after infection (i.e. 5 min) as well as after
longer incubation periods. chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells overexpressing rab5 and rab7 proteins as green
ﬂuorescent protein (gfp) constructs (gfp-rab5wt and
gfp-rab7wt) were infected with c. burnetii using a mul-
tiplicity of
infection (moi) of 50. the bacterium was
detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence using a speciﬁc
antibody (see experimental procedures). as a control,
cells overexpressing gfp alone were used. we observed
by confocal microscopy that at 40 min post infection, cph
localized with gfp-rab5- and gfp-rab7-labelled com-
partments but do not associate with gfp alone in the
vector cells (fig. 1a). as rab5 labels early endocytic
compartments and rab7 is localized in late endosomes
and lysosomes, these results suggest that cph transit via
the normal endocytic/phagocytic pathway after cell
invasion. to conﬁrm this observation we quantiﬁed the
percentage of colocalization of cph with gfp-rab5wt
and gfp-rab7wt at different
times after infection. at
5 min after infection, 58% of cph were labelled with
rab5wt, reached 73% at 20 min and decreased to 56% in
the following 40 min, whereas at 5 min only 34% of cph
localized with rab7wt and then this percentage increased
to 47% and 76% at 20 and 60 min respectively (fig. 1b).
published work has established comparable endocytic
marker conversion kinetics in epithelial cells, in both the
endocytic (rink et al., 2005) and phagocytic process
(vieira et al., 2003). these data indicate that cph asso-
ciate with rab5-labelled structures at early times and then
coxiella exploits the autophagic pathway 893
this localization decreased while the cph acquired later
endocytic markers like rab7.
the eea1 is one of the best-characterized effectors of
rab5 that favours docking/fusion events in the endocytic
pathway (simonsen et al., 1998; callaghan et al., 1999).
it has been shown that some pathogens inhibit the incor-
poration of this protein in their phagosomes as a way to
avoid subsequent lysosomal fusion (fratti et al., 2001).
therefore, it was of interest to determine the localization
of eea1 on the cph. using a speciﬁc antibody we
detected endogenous eea1 in stably transfected cells
overexpressing gfp-rab5wt at 40 and 60 min (fig. 1c)
after infection.
interaction
cph ¥ eea1 signiﬁcantly increased from 40 to 60 min
(78.5% to 97%) whereas, the interaction cph ¥ rab5 was
reduced at these times in a similar way as indicated in
fig. 1b (data not shown), taken together, these data indi-
cated that coxiella enter into the host cell by classical
phagocytosis and follow a maturation route gradually
acquiring rab5 and rab7 by interaction with endocytic
compartments.
the degree of
interestingly,
rab5 and rab7 regulate invasion and vacuole
development during coxiella infection
rab 5 and rab7 are critical regulatory factors of trafficking
through the endocytic pathway (pfeffer, 2001; deneka
et al., 2003). key regulatory functions of these proteins
have been uncovered mainly by the use of mutated pro-
teins both in in vivo and in vitro assays. the rab5q79l
mutant defective in gtp hydrolysis results in accumula-
tion of enlarged endosomes and increased in vitro endo-
some fusion. conversely, a mutation that
renders a
protein defective in gtp binding (i.e. rab5s34n) leads to
small endosomes and inhibition of endocytosis (gorvel
et al., 1991; stenmark et al., 1994). likewise, rab7
mutants with a deﬁcient gtpase activity generate
enlarged late endocytic structures whereas expression of
a gdp-locked mutant leads to small vesicles scattered
throughout the cytoplasm and inhibition of transport from
early to late endosomes, as well as degradative events
(feng et al., 1995; vitelli et al., 1997). to determine the
role of rab5 and rab7 in coxiella invasion and cph
transport we used cho cells overexpressing the wild-type
forms of these proteins and their respective mutants gtp-
locked (rab5q79l and rab7q67l) and gdp-locked
(rab5s34n and rab7t22n) as gfp constructs. the bac-
teria were detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence at 20,
40 and 60 min after infection. as shown in fig. 2a, cph
strongly colocalized with rab5wt and the positive mutant
rab5q79l. in contrast, the interaction with the negative
mutant rab5s34n was low (30%) at all times analysed
(fig. 2a and b). contrary to rab5wt that gradually disap-
peared from cph between 40 and 60 min, rab5q79l

increased in the phagosome membrane during this period
(from 70% to 80%). these results are in agreement with
our previous report that rab5q79l was present in the
membrane of crv even after long time post infection
(beron et al., 2002). moreover in these cells we observed
an increased number of cph containing more than one
bacterium (see inset rab5q79l in fig. 2a). taking into
account that the generation time of c. burnetii was calcu-
lated as ~10–12 h (coleman et al., 2004), this suggests
that the positive mutant favours homotypic fusion events.
we next analysed the effect of the overexpression of
rab5wt and mutants in coxiella infection compared with
vector transfected cells. we observed (fig. 2c) that while
in gfp-overexpressing cells the percentage of infection
(percentage of cells that contain at least one intracellular
bacterium) was maintained around 35% between 20 and
60 min post infection, in cells overexpressing rab5wt the
infection reached 50% at 20 min and was increased up to
68% in the following 40 min. this signiﬁcant difference
(p < 0.01) with respect to the control (gfp cells) indicates
that overexpression of rab5wt beneﬁts coxiella entry
supporting the observation that cph interact with
endocytic compartments.
in contrast, rab5 dominant
negative mutant (rab5s34n) reduced the infection to
~ 20% at 40 and 60 min whereas rab5q79l increased
coxiella internalization more than twofold (up to 80% at
40 min and 93% at 60 min) (fig. 2c).
with a similar methodology we evaluated the participa-
tion of rab7wt and their mutants in coxiella infection.
similar to rab5, rab7wt and rab7q67l colocalized with
cph during the early steps of coxiella intracellular trans-
port whereas the negative form rab7t22n interacted
scarcely with the bacterial phagosomes (fig. 3a).
however, in contrast to rab5, the percentage of infected
cells did not change signiﬁcantly at early times of infection
(i.e. 20 min) in cells overexpressing rab7wt or mutants,
but differences were observed at
later times (40 and
60 min) (fig. 3b). these results indicate that although
rab7 is present in the cph membrane, this protein does
not signiﬁcantly participate in the entry process of
c. burnetii. however, this protein is necessary for the
transit of cph at later times. interestingly, the percentage
of cells with two or more bacteria inside cph increased
from 19% to 36% in rab7wt cells and from 25% to 39% in
rab7q67l cells between 20 and 60 min after infection
and reached 50% at 6 h after infection in cells overex-
pressing either protein. this indicates that similar to rab5
overexpression of rab7wt or gtp active mutant favours
homotypic fusion of coxiella-containing phagosomes.
moreover, at 6 h after infection small vacuoles decorated
with rab7 begin to form (fig. 3c). thus, this observation
suggests that rab7 participates in the transport of cph
regulating their fusion and vacuole development at later
times of infection.
we further explored the participation of rab5 and rab7
in c. burnetii vacuole development. cho cells were ﬁrst
infected with coxiella and at 18 h post infection, cells were
transfected with plasmids encoding rab5wt or rab7wt or
their negatives mutants: rab5s34n and rab7t22n as
gfp constructs. as a control, cells overexpressing gfp
alone were used. after the 6 h transfection period, cells
were incubated for an additional period of 48 h (see details
in experimental procedures) to allow vacuole develop-
ment. with this experimental design we avoided the effect
of rab proteins in the invasion and early transport of cph.
as shown in the fig. 4a, a unique and large crv was
formed in cells overexpressing rab5wt or rab7wt whereas
multiples and small crvs were observed in cells overex-
pressing rab5s34n or rab7t22n. measurement of the
vacuole diameter in each case demonstrated that a signiﬁ-
cant decrease occurred in cells overexpressing negative
mutants compared with gfp cells, whereas the wild-type
proteins increased signiﬁcantly the crv size (fig. 4b).
these data indicate that both rab proteins are necessary
for the generation of the enlarged replicative vacuole sug-
gesting membrane fusion between individual cph. in con-
trast to rab5wt, rab7wt decorates the membrane of crv
as we have shown before (beron et al., 2002). this obser-
vation and the results described above show that rab7 is
present on the coxiella-containing vesicles all time analy-
sed, from cph at early times of infection (5 min 34%, see
fig. 1b) to crv.
lc3 is actively acquired at early times post infection
in a previous work we have described the interaction
between crvs and the autophagic pathway and showed
that autophagic proteins decorate the membrane of crvs
(beron et al., 2002). we have also demonstrated that
physiological or pharmacological stimulation of autophagy
in the host cell beneﬁts the development of crv (gutier-
rez et al., 2005) whereas inhibition of autophagy delayed
this process. here, we analysed the interaction between
lc3, the best-characterized autophagosome marker, and
cph at earlier times post infection. we also assessed the
effect of lc3 overexpression on the infection process.
cells overexpressing gfp-lc3 were infected with
c. burnetii for different periods of time and the bacterium
was detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence using a
speciﬁc antibody. as show in fig. 5a, lc3-labelled cph
were found at 20 min post infection and the presence of
this autophagic protein was maintained during all times
studied from 5 min to 48 h (see fig. 6b, open circles).
furthermore, the percentage of colocalization with lc3
observed at 5 min post infection was approximately 50%,
a comparable value to that obtained with rab5, indicating
that early on after internalization the bacterium interacts
with both the endocytic and autophagic pathways.

(figs 5a and 6b). it is important to mention that a similar
pattern was observed in cho-infected cells and then
processed to detect both the bacterium and endogenous
lc3 with speciﬁc antibodies (fig. 5b), indicating that the
colocalization with lc3 is not a consequence of overex-
pression of the chimeric gfp-lc3 protein. furthermore, a
quantiﬁcation analysis indicated that the percentage of
infected cells was signiﬁcantly higher at 40 and 60 min
than in control cells, indicating that overexpression of lc3
favours coxiella infection (fig. 5c). besides the use of
gfp-lc3 as an autophagosome marker, this protein pro-
vides a sensible method to detect autophagy induction. as
described in the introduction, in control conditions lc3
remains soluble in the cytoplasm of the cell (likely lc3-i),
but when autophagy is induced,
this protein is trans-
formed in lc3-ii acquiring a lipid tail and associating to
autophagosome membrane. the change of lc3-i
to
lc3-ii is frequently indicated as ‘lc3 processing’. using
an anti-gfp antibody we detected by western blot, in a
lysate of infected cells, a double band corresponding to
the gfp-lc3-i and gfp-lc3-ii
this protein
(fig. 5d, cox). similar bands were visualized in cells incu-
bated under starvation conditions for 2 h in the presence
of vinblastine to induce and accumulate autophagic vacu-
oles (fig. 5d, s + v). in contrast, only one band corre-
sponding to gfp-lc3-i was visualized in cells incubated
under full nutrient conditions (ctr). this result conﬁrms
that in c. burnetii-infected cells, lc3 is effectively pro-
cessed and autophagy stimulated.

chloramphenicol was also added to the cells during the
whole post-infection incubation period. strikingly, phago-
somes containing the chloramphenicol inactivated bacte-
ria did not colocalize with lc3 at all times studied (fig. 6a,
panels m–x). in contrast, cph containing the untreated
bacteria were clearly decorated with this protein even as
early as 5 min (fig. 6a, panels a–l). quantiﬁcation of the
percentage of bacteria that colocalize with lc3 indicates
this protein interacts with ~50–60% of
the total
that
intracellular bacteria at early times post
infection
(5, 10 and 20 min) and reached 90–95% at later times,
whereas this interaction strongly decreased (10–20%) in
chloramphenicol-treated bacteria at all
times studied
(fig. 6b). however, in the case of the endosomal markers
rab5 and rab7 practically no differences in the acquisi-
tion of these proteins to phagosomes containing inacti-
vated or untreated bacteria were observed (fig. 6c).
furthermore,
in cells infected with chloramphenicol-
treated coxiella no lc3 processing, as determined by
western blot, was observed (not shown), indicating that a
bacterial product(s) is required to stimulate lc3 process-
ing in infected cells.
the colocalization
studies indicate that active bacterial protein synthesis is
necessary to recruit lc3 or to fuse with pre-formed
autophagosomes.
in summary,
it is important to mention that some of these bacterial
factors are also critical for crv formation because this
process did not occur in cells infected with inactivated
bacteria and treated with chloramphenicol
for 48 h
(fig. 6a, compare panels i–l and u–x), conﬁrming previ-
ous observations from other authors (howe et al., 2003;
m. rabinovitch et al. unpubl. obs.), that bacterial protein
synthesis is required for parasitophorous vacuole
development.
active c. burnetii delays fusion between cph and the
lysosomal compartment
because crv are typically described as phagolysosomes
with acidic ph and the presence of lysosomal enzymes
(heinzen et al., 1999; howe and mallavia, 2000), we
analysed at what moment during coxiella infection the
cph containing live or
chloramphenicol-inactivated
bacteria, acquire lysosomal markers. c. burnetii was
pre-incubated in infection medium with or without
chloramphenicol
for 2 h as described in experimental
procedures. next, cho cells were infected with live or
inactivated c. burnetii and analysed at 20, 40 and 60 min
and 72 h post infection, followed by detection of the bac-
teria and the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin d, using spe-
ciﬁc antibodies. as described before in the treated
condition, chloramphenicol was also added to the cells
during the whole post-infection incubation period.
figure 7 shows that the distribution of the enzyme was

vesicular, predominantly localized in the perinuclear area,
where late endocytic compartments commonly reside.
interestingly, in untreated conditions, cph were scarcely
labelled with cathepsin d at the earliest times studied (20
and 40 min), whereas the degree of colocalization
increased at 60 min (fig. 7a, panels a–d and i–l). in con-
trast, cph containing inactivated bacteria were more
extensively labelled with cathepsin d even at early times
after infection (fig. 7a, panels e–h and m–p). quantiﬁca-
tion studies showed that in untreated conditions the per-
centage of colocalization at 20 min was 29% and
increased to 64% at 60 min, whereas in the presence of
chloramphenicol this percentage was 56% at 20 min and
reached 86% at 60 min (fig. 7b). as a positive control, we
used a prolonged infection time of 72 h in untreated con-
dition and conﬁrmed that cathepsin d is present inside the
crv at this time (fig. 7c). this difference in the transport
of cathepsin d to cph containing live or inactivated bac-
teria indicate that active c. burnetii regulates the lysoso-
mal fusion process in an extremely precise way, delaying
the arrival of
lysosomal enzymes at early times after
infection.
autophagy induction facilitates c. burnetii to prevent
fusion with lysosomes
to avoid the early arrival of
the results presented above show that cph interacts with
both the phagocytic and autophagic pathways at
the
same time and that fusion with lysosomes is delayed at
least for 1 h after infection. next we asked if the interac-
tion between cph and autophagosomes could help
c. burnetii
lysosomal
enzymes. to address this question, we assessed the
presence of cathepsin d within cph in cells overexpress-
ing lc3 in basal conditions or during autophagy induction.
thus, cho cells overexpressing gfp-lc3 were pre-
incubated for 2 h in full nutrient or starvation medium (see
details in experimental procedures) and, subsequently,
were infected with c. burnetii for 1 or 3 h. during this
infection period,
the respective incubation conditions
were maintained. cells were then ﬁxed and processed
to
indirect
immunoﬂuorescence. the bacteria were detected by
hoechst staining. of interest, in cells incubated under
starvation conditions a marked decrease in the colocal-
ization between the bacterium and cathepsin d was
observed at 1 h after infection (fig. 8a). based on this
observation,
the percentage of colocalization between
c. burnetii and lc3, cathepsin d or both proteins were
determined. the quantiﬁcation indicates that at 1 h post
infection amino acid deprivation caused a notable
increase in the percentage of cph colocalizing with lc3
(fig. 8b, white bars), whereas a marked reduction in the
percentage of cph that were labelled by cathepsin d

decorated with lc3 we conclude that

between the autophagic pathway and coxiella delays the

discussion
coxiella burnetii is a successful microorganism that uses
the host cell resources to establish a niche where it
resides and replicates. although the initial target of this
bacterium in vivo is the alveolar macrophages, this micro-
organism can subsequently disseminate through a wide
variety of tissues replicating in epithelial and ﬁbroblastic
cells (heinzen et al., 1999). it is known that c. burnetii
uptake is mediated by both avb3 integrin and complement
receptor 3 in monocytes (capo et al., 1999) but to date
the molecular mechanisms that regulate the initial trans-
port in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells have not been
described.
the purpose of this work was to study the initial steps of
c. burnetii
infection from entry into the host cell to the
crv development. in the present report we present evi-
dence that phase ii c. burnetii enters using a classical
phagocytic pathway in cho cells. rab5 and rab7 were
sequentially acquired by cph at early times during
infection. rab5 recruitment on cph reached the
maximum at 20 min and then gradually diminished
whereas rab7 was acquired more extensively at later
times (i.e. 40–60 min) and the recruitment of this protein
was maintained even in the crv (this paper and beron
et al., 2002). the active participation of these rab pro-
teins in the internalization process and early phagosome
transport was demonstrated by the marked decrease in
the number of infected cells and altered crv generation
when dominant negative mutants of rab5 or rab7 were
overexpressed.
several reports have shown that pathogen fate follow-
ing phagocytosis depends,
in part, on fusion events
between the phagosome and the endosomal or lysosomal
compartments. in some cases, this interaction is used for
the microorganisms to modulate phagosome maturation
by altering the recruitment or the function of key endoso-
mal proteins such as rab5 or rab7. listeria monocyto-
genes recruits rab5 to the phagosomal membrane
(alvarez-dominguez et al., 1996) but
inhibits rab5
exchange activity favouring the viability of the parasite
within the phagosome and the exclusion of listericidal
lysosomal proteases (prada-delgado et al., 2005). sal-
monella avoid the fusion with lysosomes and impair the
acquisition of the rab7-interacting lysosomal protein per-
sisting in a specialized compartment and forming a ﬁla-
mentous network towards the cell periphery (harrison
et al., 2004). m. tuberculosis leads to a phagosome matu-
ration arrest by speciﬁcally blocking the steps between
rab5 and rab7. while mycobacterium phagosomes
acquire rab5, neither rab7 nor eea1 is present on their
phagosome membrane (fratti et al., 2001). in contrast to
mycobacterium, we have shown that c. burnetii is a per-
missive bacterium that interacts with eea1 and rab7
favouring fusion events between cph and late endocytic
compartments. in agreement with our results, ghigo and
coworkers have demonstrated that a fraction of the vacu-
oles containing virulent c. burnetii acquire rab7 (ghigo
et al., 2002). the fact that c. burnetii permits the transit
via the normal endocytic pathway is not unexpected
the crv have characteristics of
considering that
in this report, we have
phagolysosomes. moreover,
shown that overexpression of
the dominant negative
mutants: rab5s34n and rab7t22n generate small and
tight vacuoles scattered throughout the cytoplasm oppo-
site to the unique large crv produced in the cells over-
expressing the respective wild-type forms. taken together
this evidence indicates that, in contrast to other intracel-
lular pathogens like toxoplasma gondii (mordue and
sibley, 1997; hakansson et al., 2001) or legionella pneu-
mophila (horwitz, 1983; roy et al., 1998; joshi et al.,
2001) which evade fusion with the endosomal compart-
ment, c. burnetii recruits endocytic/phagocytic compo-
nents such as rab5 and rab7 to facilitate their uptake
and vacuole development.
as mentioned above crv displays rab7 in the vacu-
olar membrane demonstrating the interaction with endo/
lysosomal compartments (beron et al., 2002). however,
we have also shown that this enlarged vacuole is labelled
with monodansylcadaverine (mdc) and is decorated with
the protein lc3, both used as autophagosomal markers,
clearly indicating a connection with the autophagic
pathway (beron et al., 2002). moreover the crv deco-
rated with lc3 acquired lysosomal enzymes, which indi-
cates that the ﬁnal compartment where c. burnetii resides
have characteristics of an autophagolysosome (beron
et al., 2002; gutierrez et al., 2005). in this report we show
that lc3 interacts with cph at early times after infection
and this protein is retained on the coxiella-containing
compartment during the whole infection period analysed.
when cells are treated with conditions that stimulate
autophagy a conjugation reaction occurs in the lc3
protein that changes its intracellular distribution from the
cytosolic form lc3-i to the membrane-associated form
lc3-ii. we have observed that infection with c. burnetii
stimulates lc3 processing as indicated by the targeting of
this protein to autophagic structures and the increased
processing to the lc3-ii form. noteworthy, in the pres-
ence of chloramphenicol which speciﬁcally inhibits bacte-
rial protein synthesis, no lc3 was recruited to the cph,
indicating that coxiella secretes protein factors that
actively modulate the interaction with the autophagic
pathway. in agreement with previous observation from the
group of robert heinzen and collaborators (howe et al.,

is a critical event
2003)
the coxiella-parasitophorous vacuole was not
developed in the presence of chloramphenicol. we pos-
tulate that inhibition of the interaction with the autophagic
pathway, which is hampered in the presence of the anti-
biotic,
in the development of crv.
indeed, we have previously shown that conditions that
favour autophagy (e.g. starvation), as well as overexpres-
sion of proteins involved in the autophagic pathway accel-
erates the biogenesis of
the
replication of this pathogen in the host cell (gutierrez
et al., 2005).
the crv and beneﬁt
it is known that c. burnetii requires an acidic ph to
activate its metabolism and replication (hackstadt and
williams, 1981). vacuoles containing c. burnetii present
characteristics of phagolysosomes demonstrated by the
presence of the ﬂuid phase marker thorium dioxide and
the lysosomal enzymes 5′-nucleotidase and acid
phosphatase (howe and mallavia, 2000). moreover, the
membrane of
these vacuoles acquires the lysosomal
membrane proteins lamp-1 (heinzen et al., 1999; ghigo
et al., 2002). in our system, fusion of cph with lysosomes
was actively delayed because only a 29% of the phago-
somes containing untreated bacteria were labelled with
cathepsin d at 20 min after infection compared with the
56% obtained with chloramphenicol-inactivated bacteria.
these results are in agreement with other authors that
have shown that c. burnetii delays phagolysosomal
fusion and exhibits a morphological change from scv to
lcv in a compartment
to this
phagosome/lysosome fusion event (howe and mallavia,
2000). because cathepsin d is a marker of either phagoly-
sosomes or autophagolysosomes, the last result can be
interpreted in two ways, ﬁrst the bacteria actively recruit
the autophagy machinery slowing the transit to lysosomes
or the bacteria produce factors that slow the autophagy
pathway,
likely activated in response to intracellular
pathogens. we have observed that the delay in the fusion
cph–lysosomes was enhanced when autophagy is
induced indicating that
interaction with this cellular
process has a beneﬁcial effect in c. burnetii infection and
development. moreover, this interaction with autophago-
somes is likely one of the mechanisms used by this patho-
gen to prolong the arrival of acidic hydrolases for an
interval of time.
less acidic prior
taken together our results show that c. burnetii inter-
acts with both the phagocytic and autophagic pathways
even at early times after infection. based in our results,
we postulate that c. burnetii uses the autophagic pathway
to momentarily
to
phagolysosomes. this hypothesis is supported by the
observation that infection with c. burnetii produces accu-
mulation of autophagosomes labelled with lc3 which will
be available for fusion with cph (see fig. 5). recently, it
was shown that vacuoles containing legionella pneumo-
transport

phila present autophagic characteristics and that these
pathogen-containing vacuoles accumulated the autoph-
agic dye mdc more slowly compared with autophago-
somes induced by amino acid-free buffer, indicating that
this bacterium is able to inhibit autophagosome matura-
tion (amer and swanson, 2005).
it is well established that c. burnetii undergoes a mor-
phological change from scvs to lcvs during the course
of the infection. the lcv form is described as the repli-
cative form with dispersed chromatin and high metabolic
activity. although previous studies have demonstrated
that this transition is favoured in the presence of an acidic
ph (heinzen et al., 1996), a more recent report postulates
that the scv–lcv transformation begins in a compart-
ment prior to phagolysosomal fusion (howe and mallavia,
2000). moreover we have recently shown that the shift
from scvs to lcvs seems to be increased in cells
incubated under starvation conditions (gutierrez and
colombo, 2005), thus, we postulate that the nutrients
provided by these nutrient-rich autophagosomes could
trigger the signals required for the morphological change.
in the present work we have shown that c. burnetii pha-
gosomes fuse with autophagosomes delaying the arrival
of the typical lysosomal enzyme cathepsin d under star-
vation conditions. we propose that c. burnetii
interacts
with the autophagic pathway to create a gap at some
stage in the infection process. during this period of time
(from internalization to ~2–3 h) the transition from scv to
lcv is activated, likely by the nutrient-rich environment
that surrounds the bacteria. then, phagosomes contain-
ing lcv forms fuse with late endocytic compartments
increasing vacuole size and favouring coxiella replication.
to c. burnetii, other pathogens such as
legionella and leishmania block phagosomal maturation
and after a ‘pregnant pause’ generate replicative forms
(swanson and fernandez-moreira, 2002). these three
microorganisms have bimorphic life cycles and create
speciﬁc environments to activate the transition between
both developmental forms. in summary, our study reports
that c. burnetii actively exploits the autophagic pathway
delaying fusion with lysosomes likely modulating intracel-
lular pathogen fate after infection.

clone 4 phase ii nine mile strain of c. burnetii bacteria, which are
infective for cells but not for mammals, were provided by ted
hackstadt (rocky mountain laboratories, niaid, nih, hamilton,
mt, usa) and handled in a biosafety level ii facility (hackstadt,
1996). infective inocula were prepared as described (zamboni
et al., 2001). non-conﬂuent vero cells were cultured in t25 ﬂasks
at 37°c in d-mem supplemented with 5% fbs, 0.22 g l-1 sodium
bicarbonate and 20 mm hepes, ph 7 (mfbh). cultures were
infected with c. burnetii phase ii suspensions for 2–6 days at
37°c in an air atmosphere. after freezing at -70°c, the ﬂasks
were thawed, and the cells scrapped and passed 20 times
through a 27-gauge needle connected to a syringe. cells lysates
were centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4°c. the supernatants
were centrifuged at 24 000 g for 30 min at 4°c, and pellets con-
taining c. burnetii were resuspended with 0.5 ml pbs, aliquoted
and frozen at -70°c.
infection of cells with c. burnetii for short times
cho cells grown in t25 ﬂasks were washed several times with
pbs and detached with trypsin-edta. after resuspending with
mfbh, cells were plated on coverslips distributed in 24 well
plates. for short infection times, a 100 ml aliquot of c. burnetii
suspension was diluted in 5 ml mfbh, and 0.5 ml of this dilution
was added per well. with this dilution a moi of 50 was obtained
(gutierrez et al., 2005). after a centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min,
cells were incubated for 20, 40 and 60 min at 37°c in an atmo-
sphere of 95% air and 5% co2 and washed several times with
pbs to eliminate extracellular bacteria. cells were ﬁxed and
analysed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence as described below.
the same protocol was used for the infection of cho cells
overexpressing egfp-lc3wt, egfp-rab5wt or egfp-rab7wt
and mutants.
development of c. burnetii vacuole
cho cells were grown and plated on coverslips as before. a 50 ml
aliquot of c. burnetii suspension was diluted in 10 ml mfbh, and
1 ml of this dilution was added per well. with this dilution a moi
of 10 was obtained. after 18 h of infection cells were washed
three times and transfected with pegfp plasmids encoding
rab5wt, rab5s34n, rab7wt or rab7t22n by using lipo-
fectamine reagent (life technologies) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. cells were incubated in mfbh at 37°c in
an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2 for 48 h before analysis.
effect of chloramphenicol on cph
equivalent suspensions of coxiella infection media were pre-
pared by adding an aliquot of c. burnetii in a volume of mfbh with
(experimental medium) or without (control medium) chloram-
phenicol, at a bacteriostatic concentration of 10 mg ml-1 (howe
et al., 2003). both suspensions were pre-incubated for 2 h at
37°c in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2. cho cells or
stably transfected cho cells overexpressing gfp-lc3, gfp-
rab5wt or gfp-rab7wt were plated on coverslips of 24 well
plates and infected with the corresponding experimental
(+ chloramphenicol) or control
infection media containing
c. burnetii at a moi = 50 for 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 min and for 48 h
at 37°c. cells were ﬁxed and analysed by indirect immunoﬂuo-
rescence to detect either coxiella or cathepsin d as described
below.
autophagy induction
autophagy was induced by amino acid starvation. cells were
washed three times with pbs and incubated with 0.5 ml earle’s

balanced salts solution (ebss, sigma) at 37°c for 2 h before
infection with c. burnetii. the same solution (ebss) was used
during the infection period in starvation condition.
fluorescence microscopy
infected cells overexpressing egfp-rab5wt, egfp-rab7wt and
mutants or egfp-lc3 were analysed by confocal microscopy
with a nikon c1 confocal microscope system and the ez-c1
program (nikon, japan). triple colocalization images were
obtained by ﬂuorescence microscopy using an inverted micro-
scope (nikon eclipse 2000, japan) equipped with a ccd camera
(orca i, hamamatsu) and meta morph program, serie 4.5

images corporation). all
indirect immunoﬂuorescence
cells were ﬁxed with 0.5 ml of 3% paraformaldehyde solution in
pbs for 10 min at room temperature and quenched by incubating
with 50 mm nh4cl in pbs. subsequently, cells were permeabi-
lized with 0.05% saponin in pbs containing 0.2% bsa, and then
incubated with a primary antibody against coxiella (1:400) and
then detected by incubation with anti-rabbit texas red (1:200) or
alexa 488 (1:250) conjugated secondary antibodies. for double
immunolabelling, primary antibodies against eea1 (1:100) or
cathepsin d (1:50) were used, followed by incubation with anti-
mouse cy3 (1:800) and anti-goat alexa 546 (1:250) secondary
antibodies respectively. next coxiella was detected with a spe-
ciﬁc antibody following by incubation with a secondary antibody
labelled with alexa 350 (1:50). cells were mounted with mowiol
and analysed by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
measurement of the percentage of infected cells and
percentage of colocalization
at different times after infection, cells were ﬁxed for 10 min in 3%
paraformaldehyde. the percentage of infection was calculated as
the ratio between the number of infected cells and the number of
total cells. at least 100 cells were scored in no less than three
independent experiments using a nikon c1 confocal microscope
system and the ez-c1 program (nikon, japan). infected cells
were deﬁned as those with at least one clear identiﬁable bacte-
rium inside. the percentage of colocalization was calculated as
the ratio between the number of internalized bacteria that colo-
calize with the indicated protein and the total number of internal-
ized bacteria using confocal microscopy. the size of the vacuoles
in fig. 4 was determined by a morphometric analysis using
adobe photoshop 7.0 program (adobe systems).
western blot analysis
cho cells overexpressing gfp-lc3 were grown to approxi-
mately 50% conﬂuence and infected with c. burnetii in mfbh at a
moi of 10. after
the indicated times, cells were washed,
trypsinized and incubated for 20 min at 4°c with ripa buffer (5%
nonidet p40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 5% sds, 0.5 m tris,
0.75 m nacl) in the presence of protease inhibitors. the sample
starvation plus vinblastine (s + v) was obtained by pre-
coxiella exploits the autophagic pathway 907
incubation of the cells for 2 h with ebss containing 100 mm
vinblastine. samples were centrifuged and the corresponding
supernatants were frozen until use. for western blots analysis,
100 mg of protein extracts was subjected to electrophoresis in
10% sds-page gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane,
blocked with pbs supplemented with 0.1% v/v of tween 20 and
3% of milk. the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 2 h
with a rabbit polyclonal anti-gfp antibody (abcam, cambridge,
ma) at 1:2000 dilution, washed and incubated with a secondary
hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (jackson immuno res.,
usa) at a 1:50 000 dilution. the bands were visualized with the
ecl reagent (amersham biosciences, uk).
