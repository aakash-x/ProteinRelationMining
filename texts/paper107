while necrotic cell death is attracting considerable interest, its molecular bases are still poorly understood. investigations in
simple biological models, taken for instance outside the animal kingdom, may beneﬁt from less interference from other cell death
mechanisms and from better experimental accessibility, while providing phylogenetic information. can necrotic cell death occur
outside the animal kingdom? in the protist dictyostelium, developmental stimuli induced in an autophagy mutant a stereotyped
sequence of events characteristic of necrotic cell death. this sequence included swift mitochondrial uncoupling with
mitochondrial 20,70-dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate ﬂuorescence, atp depletion and increased oxygen consumption. this was
followed by perinuclear clustering of dilated mitochondria. rapid plasma membrane rupture then occurred, which was
evidenced by time-lapse videos and quantiﬁed by facs. of additional
interest, developmental stimuli and classical
mitochondrial uncouplers triggered a similar sequence of events, and exogenous glucose delayed plasma membrane rupture in
a nonglycolytic manner. the occurrence of necrotic cell death in the protist dictyostelium (1) provides a very favorable model for
further study of this type of cell death, and (2) strongly suggests that the mechanism underlying necrotic cell death was present
in an ancestor common to the amoebozoa protists and to animals and has been conserved in evolution.

different
types of cell death have long been deﬁned in
morphological terms.1,2 thus, mammalian cells can die from
‘apoptosis’,
‘necrosis’ and ‘autophagic cell death’, and
intermediate or mixed cell death types have also been
reported. while caspase-dependent apoptosis has been
studied in detail,
less is known regarding the precise
molecular mechanisms underlying caspase-independent
types of cell death. these may play an important role
especially in pathological circumstances and are thus now
attracting considerable interest. caspase-independent cell
death mechanisms that are not prominent in the usual model
organisms may be more experimentally accessible in simpler
biological models,3 with potentially less interference from
other cell death pathways. the underlying mechanisms may
be phylogenetically conserved, which would be of interest in
itself and would allow the extension of results obtained with
simple models to higher eukaryotes.
in animal cells, necrosis is often deﬁned as a nonapoptotic,
nonautophagic type of cell death, with swelling of cells and
organelles and, importantly, early plasma membrane rup-
ture.4,5 at a molecular level, necrosis but not apoptosis is often
accompanied by acute atp depletion that is thought to cause
cell death.6,7
dictyostelium discoideum, a protist that emerged in evolu-
tion after plants and from an ancestor common to fungi and
animals,8 shows developmental cell death.9 this can be
mimicked in monolayers of dictyostelium cells subjected to
starvation and to the differentiation-inducing factor dif-1
(hereafter designated dif10). the type of cell death thus
obtained includes vacuolization.11,12 vacuolization is depen-
dent on autophagy as inactivation of the atg1 autophagy
gene13 prevented it. importantly, when subjected to starvation
and dif, these atg1-1 cells still died, but now of a rapid
nonvacuolar cell death.14
we report here that
this nonvacuolar cell death in
dictyostelium possesses classical characteristics of necrotic
cell death. this strongly suggests that
the mechanism
underlying necrotic cell death emerged in evolution before
the divergence to amoebozoa protists and animals.
results
rapid mitochondrial uncoupling. hallmarks of necrotic
cell death in mammalian cells include a rapid oxidative burst,
mitochondrial uncoupling and plasma membrane rupture.
to investigate whether early events following the addition of
dif to dictyostelium hmx44a.atg1-1 cells (‘cells’, used
throughout, unless mentioned otherwise)
included an
oxidative burst, we used the ﬂuorescent probe 20,70-
dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate (dc-fda). upon addition of
dif, starved cells stained ﬂuorescent in the presence of dc-
fda, as shown by microscopy and by ﬂow cytometry
(figure 1). the same pattern of ﬂuorescent labelling was
obtained with dihydrorhodamine 123 and aminophenyl
ﬂuorescein, but not with hydroethidium or mitosox red
(not shown). like other signs of nonvacuolar cell death, dc-
fda ﬂuorescence required prior starvation (not shown) and

figure 1 induction of dc-fda ﬂuorescence following the addition of dif. starved hmx44a.atg1-1 cells were incubated with dc-fda and with (b) or without (a) dif for
15–30 min and analyzed by phase-contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy. the majority of cells were markedly ﬂuorescent and showed perinuclear clustering of organelles only
when dif was added. contrast and luminosity had to be increased to see the very weak ﬂuorescence label of cells without dif. also, some photoactivation in dc-fda-labelled
cells occurred during ﬂuorescence microscopy examination, leading to an increase in ﬂuorescence only in cells that were already labelled, thus only among dif-induced cells,
therefore not affecting qualitative evaluation of labelling. (c, and d) flow cytometry showed compared to cells without dif (c) the presence of a ‘cloud’ of ﬂuorescent cells upon
addition of dif (d). (e, and f) the emergence of ﬂuorescent cells as a function of time was followed by continuous ﬂow cytometry, starting the acquisition immediately after dif
addition. cells without dif remained negative (e), whereas after the addition of dif some cells became ﬂuorescent as soon as 200 s, and most were ﬂuorescent after 1000 s (f)

addition of dif. remarkably, as shown by ﬂow cytometry
some of
the dc-fda-exposed cells became ﬂuorescent
within 3 min after the addition of dif and most of them were
ﬂuorescent after 15 min (figure 1 and not shown). after a few
minutes, only few cells with intermediate ﬂuorescence levels
could be detected (figure 1d and f),
indicating a rapid
transition from no to full ﬂuorescence in each cell. confocal
microscopy of cells after dif addition showed for most
stained structures colocalization of mitotracker orange
(leading to red ﬂuorescence of mitochondria) and dc-fda
(leading to green ﬂuorescence),
indicating that dc-fda
ﬂuorescence was mitochondrial (figure 2).
has been argued that oxidative stress can trigger necrotic cell
death. however, we did not observe any inhibition of dc-fda
ﬂuorescence and of membrane rupture by an extensive range
of inhibitors of oxidative burst (not shown). this might be
owing to limited membrane permeability in starved dictyos-
telium cells (but see also for reservations as to interpretation
of dc-fda ﬂuorescence15). this lack of effect of inhibitors
prevented us from formally concluding on the existence of an
oxidative burst early in this cell death pathway. in any case,
this dc-fda ﬂuorescence revealed early dif-induced events
in mitochondria, presumably an oxidative burst, contemporary
with mitochondrial uncoupling as shown below.
the ﬂuorescence of dc-fda and of dihydrorhodamine 123
is most often interpreted as revealing an oxidative burst, and it
unlike apoptotic cell death, mammalian necrotic cell death
is often associated with atp depletion.4,6,7 in wild-type

dictyostelium cells, starvation led to some atp depletion,
which was not increased upon addition of dif; this may be
related to the absence of increased dc-fda ﬂuorescence in
this case (not shown). in atg1-1 cells, starvation similarly led to
atp depletion. this apparent atp depletion upon starvation
in both parental and atg1-1 cells may merely result from a
starvation-induced reduction in size occurring in both types
of cells. however, in starved atg1-1 but not in wild-type
cells, atp per cell was further decreased upon addition of
dif (figure 3a), likely through a decrease of the cellular
concentration of atp. signiﬁcant atp depletion occurred
within 3 min after the addition of dif (figure 3b). this atp
depletion suggested that dif could directly or indirectly
uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. an im-
mediate consequence of such uncoupling should be an
increase in oxygen consumption rate, which indeed occurred
within less than a minute after the addition of dif (or of
dinitrophenol
showing
mitochondrial uncoupling) to starved cells (figure 3c). we
conclude that addition of dif to starved cells leads to
almost
immediate uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation.
(dnp) as a positive control
about 20 min after the addition of dif, some cells became
round with perinuclear clustering of cell organelles, which
extended to almost all cells by 30 min (time-lapse videos in
online supplementary material). by electron microscopy,
most cells showed at
this time perinuclear clustering of
otherwise dilated mitochondria.14 clustering may be linked to
the dependence of the actin system on energy supply by atp.
perinuclear clustering has been reported also in circum-
stances other than necrotic cell death, while dilation of
mitochondria is usually associated with it.
plasma membrane rupture. in animal cells, one of
the
most distinctive traits of necrotic cell death compared to other
types of cell death is rapid rupture of the plasma membrane.
in wild-type dictyostelium cells, 50% of the cells showed
membrane rupture about 36 h after the addition of dif, as
detected by propidium iodide (pi) uptake.11,12 in atg1-1 cells,
this occurred 30–300 min after the addition of dif as shown
by phase-contrast microscopy (figure 4) and by time-lapse
videos (online supplementary material). sequences of still
frames from these videos allowed a more precise timing of
the duration of the membrane rupture event itself. only about
15 s were required to shift from an apparently intact plasma
membrane to its almost complete disappearance (figure 4a).
in some but not all instances, an increase in apparent cell
volume could be detected just before membrane rupture
(time-lapse videos in online supplementary material). this
cell swelling and the mitochondrial swelling seen by electron
microscopy14 are reminiscent of
the classical cell and
organelle swelling in mammalian necrotic cell death.
in all cases, plasma membrane rupture left behind some
‘core’ material (figure 4a) whose aspect was distinct from that
of the initial living cell. this physical change of dying cells
suggested that detection and quantiﬁcation of this cell death
might be possible through measure of cell scatter. indeed,
ﬂow cytometry showed upon addition of dif the appearance
of events of lower forward scatter (fsc) and slightly higher
side scatter (ssc), generating a ‘cloud’ distinct from that of

varies signiﬁcantly from experiment to experiment. this percentage would rise further at later times, reaching a maximum around 5 h post-dif (see f)
cells not subjected to dif (figure 4b and c). cells in the cloud
appearing after the addition of dif were dead, as 96–98%
were positive for pi staining compared to 2–4% in the pre-
existing cloud (figure 4d and e). within the time frame of
these experiments, no gross secondary degradation of dead
cells occurred that might generate a high proportion of large
debris counted as new dead cells, as judged by relative
stability of dead cell ‘cloud’ parameters and by microscopy
(not shown). as an additional check, in every experiment we
systematically veriﬁed the state of cells by phase-contrast
microscopy, and found a consistent and strong correlation
between the degree of cell alteration seen at 60 min post-dif
and the % cell membrane rupture measured by facs at 2.5 h
post-dif.
flow cytometry of unlabelled cells thus allowed quantitative
assessment of the proportion of dead cells, for instance, at
various times after the addition of dif (figure 4f). while
without dif cell death remained below 15% even at 9 h, upon
addition of dif cell death reached a maximum of more than
75% after 5 h. half-maximum values were reached at 2.5 h
post-dif, which was therefore used thereafter as a sensitive
read-out time. the slope of the curve at this time indicated a
speed of cell death of about 20% cells per hour (figure 4f), a
useful indication in time-lapse experiments that statistically
one cell out of ﬁve would die in a given microscope ﬁeld within
1 h. in this report, we operationally deﬁne cell death as rupture
of the cell membrane, resulting under the microscope in a
smaller and immobile mass of mostly organelles or organelle
remnants, which can be stained by pi and shows by ﬂow
cytometry a shift in scatter.
as shown above, dif induces uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation and plasma membrane rupture. addition of
the classical inducers of uncoupling dnp or carbonyl cyanide
3-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) to starved (but not
to
unstarved) cells also led to atp depletion and oxygen
consumption increase, dc-fda ﬂuorescence, perinuclear
clustering, and early plasma membrane rupture (figures 3
and 4g and not shown). both latter traits were also observed in
cell death and differentiation
270

parental cells (not shown). this similar effect of dissimilar
molecules all endowed with uncoupling activity indicated that
in starved cells mitochondrial uncoupling may be sufﬁcient for
subsequent events including plasma membrane rupture. we
then wished to investigate how this uncoupling can lead to
plasma membrane rupture.
from mitochondrial uncoupling to membrane rupture,
as probed with exogenous glucose. in mammalian cells,
atp depletion linked to uncoupling is often believed to be the
cause of necrotic cell death, on the basis of results showing
that provision of glucose led to both replenishment of atp
and prevention of necrotic cell death in mammalian
cells.6,7,16–18 to try to link mitochondrial uncoupling and
membrane rupture in dictyostelium necrotic cell death, we
investigated whether exogenous glucose would both prevent
or delay cell death and replenish atp, in this system in which
the cells were deprived of glucose because of experimental
starvation and atg1 mutation.
the addition of 5 mm glucose indeed delayed dif-induced
cell death as assessed by membrane rupture (figure 5a) by
more than 6 h, thus increasing more than fourfold the time
required to reach a given level of cell death. the addition of
glucose to atg1-1 cells (but not to parental cells, not shown)
led to markedly less membrane rupture at 2.5 h after dif in
each of more than 30 experiments. the addition of glucose did
not, however, prevent or grossly delay dc-fda ﬂuorescence
(figure 5b), showing that exogenous glucose affected a
cell death stage downstream of mitochondrial events. dif-
induced glucose-delayed cell death was morphologically
similar to that occurring earlier in the absence of glucose
(not shown). glucose delayed plasma membrane rupture
induced not only by dif but also by classical uncouplers
(figure 5c). the delay in membrane rupture observed

figure 5 glucose but not some other sugars delays cell membrane rupture. (a) glucose slowed down dif-induced cell membrane rupture. starved hmx44a.atg1-1 cells
were incubated with dif in the absence (m) or in the presence of 5 mm glucose (e), and the percentage of cells with membrane rupture was followed with time. controls
without dif with (’) or without glucose (.) showed almost no death. (b) glucose did not grossly delay dif-induced dc-fda ﬂuorescence or perinuclear clustering. starved
cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of glucose 5 mm. then, without discarding glucose, dc-fda was added together with, or without dif, and cells were checked
by microscopy after another 30 min. all ﬂuorescent pictures were taken with a set exposure time of 2 s. in each labelled cell, organelles form a ﬂuorescent cluster around a
much smaller nucleus. (c) also uncoupler-induced cell membrane rupture is delayed by glucose or 2-dog but not by sorbitol. starved cells were preincubated for 30 min with
no sugar, or 5 mm of glucose, 2-dog or sorbitol (from left to right in each group of four columns, respectively), then in some chambers 100 nm of dif, or 30 mm of dnp, or
30 nm of cccp, or no uncoupler, was added as indicated. cell membrane rupture was checked 2.5 h after this addition. (d) glucose delays cell membrane rupture more than
fructose or sorbitol. starved cells were incubated for 30 min in the absence or in the presence of 1–6 mm of glucose (’), fructose (m) or sorbitol (.), then without removing
the sugars dif was added. percentage cell membrane rupture was measured by ﬂow cytometry after 2.5 h of incubation. (e) glucose delays cell membrane rupture more than
each of a range of sugars and than sorbitol. starved cells were incubated for 30 min in the absence or in the presence of 5 mm of the indicated sugar, and treated as in (d)
cell death and differentiation
with exogenous glucose was not, or far less, observed
with 5 mm sorbitol or fructose (figure 5d), thus excluding a
simple osmotic effect. also, trehalose and to a lesser extent
sucrose, known to confer more efﬁciently than glucose cell
resistance to an abiotic stress possibly through peculiar
solution properties (for a review see crowe et al.19), were far
less efﬁcient than glucose at delaying membrane rupture
(figure 5e), making this explanation unlikely in the present
situation.
although glucose delayed dif-induced plasma membrane
rupture, in marked contrast addition of galactose or mannose
led to no more membrane rupture delay than the sorbitol
control (figure 5e). this showed that speciﬁc recognition of
glucose was required for its membrane effect. 6-deoxyglu-
cose led to little membrane rupture delay (figure 6a), showing
for the delaying effect of glucose.
that c6 is signiﬁcant
that can be c6-
importantly, 2-deoxyglucose (2-dog),
phosphorylated but cannot undergo glycolysis past
this
phosphorylation, led to a delay in dif (and also dnp and
cccp)-induced membrane rupture (figures 5c and 6a, c),
however sometimes less marked than with glucose. this
result showed that at least part of the membrane-rupture-
delaying effect of glucose can occur without glycolysis.
consistent with the 2-dog results, addition of glucose 5 mm
did not obviously replenish atp (figure 6b) tested 5–120 min
after addition of dif (not shown). in contrast, addition as a
control of cell-permeant methylpyruvate replenished atp or
prevented its depletion (figure 6b) and also prevented dif-
induced dc-fda ﬂuorescence, perinuclear clustering (not
shown) and membrane rupture (figure 6c). altogether, in
dictyostelium necrotic cell death exogenous glucose delayed
membrane rupture otherwise than through glycolysis and atp
replenishment, strongly indicating a nonglycolytic effect of
glucose in this case.

necrotic cell death: from mitochondrial uncoupling to
cell membrane rupture. following addition of dif to
starved atg1-1dictyostelium cells, early events occurring
within 1–3 min include dc-fda mostly mitochondrial
ﬂuorescence, atp depletion and oxygen consumption
increase, all of
these pointing toward mitochondrial
uncoupling. this is consistent with the fact that dif can be
replaced by the classical uncouplers dnp or cccp. these
results are complementary to those of shaulsky and
loomis,20 who showed that dif was able to reduce the
membrane potential of isolated submitochondrial particles.
both sets of results lead to the conclusion that there is an
uncoupling effect of dif. the results of shaulsky and
loomis20 indicated that the uncoupling effect of dif may
occur through its direct interaction with mitochondria. thus,
remarkably the dif differentiation factor may act at least in
part through rapid uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.
in dictyostelium development, dif has also been shown
to activate transcription factors. when added after a 4 h
starvation period, dif led within 2–3 min to the tyrosine
the statc transcription factor,21 thus

the fact that distinct moieties such as dnp and cccp
(classical uncouplers) and dif induced both mitochondrial
uncoupling and plasma membrane rupture strongly indicated
that in this system mitochondrial uncoupling is sufﬁcient for
membrane rupture. whether there is a causal relationship

this is through atp depletion (although atp depletion is a
convenient explanation for alterations of the cytoskeleton
leading to perinuclear clustering of mitochondria, and of
membrane atp-dependent molecular pumps contributing to
membrane rupture).
plasma membrane rupture delayed by glucose. in
mammalian necrotic cell death, glucose-induced rescue
was explained through concomitant atp replenishment.6,7
in dictyostelium necrotic cell death, addition of glucose or
of 2-dog led to membrane rupture delay with no atp
replenishment (this report). at least in dictyostelium, factors
other
than atp depletion govern membrane rupture in
necrotic cell death, and can be controlled by exogenous
glucose. in mammalian necrotic cell death, these factors may
occur, but may have been ignored owing to the readily
available explanation of atp replenishment
through
glycolysis.
exogenous glucose may act extracellularly to stabilize the
membrane, either by a direct effect or through transmem-
brane signaling by unspeciﬁed glucose receptors. exogenous
glucose may also, or instead, act intracellularly, which we tend
to favor based on the requirement for c6 phosphorylation
and on the commonly accepted intracellular location of
hexokinases/glucokinases. once in cells, to delay membrane
rupture glucose must be both speciﬁcally recognized and c6-
phosphorylated, presumably by a glucokinase. dictyostelium
possesses no hexokinases but structurally unrelated gluco-
kinases (eichinger et al.25; see also http://dictybase.org/),
which, of note, showed activity in cells undergoing develop-
ment.26 glucose delayed plasma membrane rupture but not
dc-fda ﬂuorescence, perinuclear clustering of mitochondria
or atp depletion. thus, the delaying effect of glucose was
downstream or independent of early mitochondrial events.
the efﬁcacy of 2-dog and the absence of atp replenish-
ment strongly indicate that the effect of glucose on membrane
rupture was not through glycolysis. in animal cells, glucose
can modulate hexokinases in an energy-independent manner
leading to voltage-dependent anion channel control of
thereby affecting apoptotic cell death.27–30
mitochondria,
also,
in some animal cells glucose inhibited cell death
apparently through the pentose phosphate pathway.31 as an
example, some mammalian cells could be protected from
h2o2-induced necrotic cell death by 2-dog ﬂowing into the
pentose phosphate pathway and producing nadph; exogen-
ous glucose led only or mostly to glycolysis, and the pentose
phosphate pathway was favored only when 2-dog was
added instead of glucose.32 in starved dictyostelium cells, for
unknown reasons exogenous glucose cannot undergo glyco-
lysis. in both cases, (le goffe et al.32, this report), atp was
not produced.
altogether, we conclude that mitochondrial uncoupling
leads to plasma membrane rupture in this necrotic cell death,
whereas exogenous glucose delays it nonglycolytically
(figure 6d).
dictyostelium necrotic cell death and the phylogenesis
of cell death. dictyostelium, a protist, belongs to the unikont
group of eukaryotes together with fungi and animals.33
the present results show that a similar necrotic cell death
pathway can operate in both animal cells and dictyostelium.
necrosis would thus seem more widespread and more
ancient than apoptosis dependent on bona ﬁde caspases,
which is restricted to the animal kingdom. necrosis must
have existed in an ancestor common to dictyostelium and
animals, and may thus qualify as a primordial cell death
mechanism within unikont eukaryotes. it will be of interest to
check whether a similar necrotic cell death mechanism exists
among eukaryotes in other unikonts such as fungi, and in
bikonts such as plants.
the existence of several distinct
types of cell death
coexisting in the same cell (for a review see golstein and
kroemer34) raises the question of which selective advantage
led to their emergence in evolution. this bears on phylo-
genetic evolution of a function, as opposed to that of a
molecule or of a species. in phylogeny, a primordial (necrotic)
cell death mechanism may have been conserved through at
least some eukaryotic kingdoms. this conservation of
necrotic cell death may have been accompanied by serial
addition of molecules allowing other types of cell death, for
instance, caspases at the emergence of the animal kingdom
to allow apoptosis, perhaps initially to facilitate cell corpse
dismantling.34
more speciﬁcally, in a remote ancestor of dictyostelium, a
primordial necrotic mechanism of cell death may have
operated upon starvation, possibly on some isolated cells to
ensure survival of others. addition upon evolution of atg1 and
autophagy would have allowed initial developmental aggrega-
tion (which atg1-1 mutant cells cannot undergo35). it would
have led also to a much slower course of cell death in
dictyostelium (compare the kinetics of death for atg1-1cells in
this report and for wild-type cells11). a slower course of cell
death during dictyostelium development would have provided
enough time in this development for morphogenetic signalling
of prestalk to prespore cells, cellulose synthesis and formation
of a stalk. this may be an example of evolutionary modulation
of cell death (interestingly, modulation of mechanism rather
than of occurrence) inducing/allowing a shift in developmental
pattern.
a model
for the study of necrotic cell death. dict-
yostelium stalk cell death, at
least as mimicked in
monolayer cultures,
is triggered by dif and starvation,
which are physiological stimuli of dictyostelium development.
this cell death is autophagic vacuolar for parental cells and
necrotic for atg1-1cells. thus, dictyostelium cell death (kosta
et al.14; this report) is necrotic when autophagy is prevented,
reminiscent of mouse embryonic interdigital cell death being
necrotic when apoptosis is prevented,36 providing examples of
necrotic cell death resulting from developmental signals at
least when other cell death mechanisms are inhibited.
necrotic death of atg1-1 dictyostelium cells is one of the
very few instances where a developmental trigger leads in
a cell line to death in the absence of genes encoding bcl-2
family members, or caspase or metacaspase genes (its only
paracaspase gene is not involved in cell death37 and lam

line can undergo neither
et al., in preparation). this cell
autophagy nor apoptosis, thus ensuring minimal interference
from other types of cell death with its necrotic cell death.
dictyostelium bears a haploid and now sequenced genome,
which contributes to its experimental and genetic tractability.
together with a few other thoroughly studied models (for
instance, mammalian cells4,38 and caenorhabditis elegans5),
this model
is thus attractive for further investigation on
molecular mechanisms of necrotic cell death.

hmx44a (for derivation, see levraud et al.12) and hmx44a. atg1-1 (an hmx44a
derivative mutated for the autophagy gene atg114) were routinely grown at 221c in
hl5 medium39 as modiﬁed,11 except for maltose which was 9 g/l. blasticidin (10 mg/
ml) was added to the hmx44a.atg1-1 cultures.
for experiments, unless stated otherwise, vegetative cells in growth phase were
washed once and resuspended in 10 mm mes (mes hydrate, sigma m2933)
prepared in demineralized water. the ph of this mes buffer was found to matter.
the pho6 increased, and ph46.6 decreased cell membrane rupture, perinuclear
clustering and dc-fda ﬂuorescence (not shown). the ph was therefore adjusted at
6.4 with naoh in all experiments, and every molecular species tested in this report
was checked not to alter this ph by more than 0.2 ph units. the cells were adjusted
at a concentration of 3 105 cells/ml. one milliliter of this cell suspension was
distributed in each well of lab-tek culture chambers (ref. 155380, nalge nunc,
naperville, il, usa; these have a thin glass coverslip bottom allowing high-power
inverted ﬂuorescence microscopy) with the addition of camp to a ﬁnal concentration
of 3 mm. incubation proceeded for 16 h at 221c in mes buffer and camp. the
previously used 8 h incubation period11,40 was found limiting for atg1-1cells. a
starvation period of sufﬁcient duration was essential for efﬁcient induction by dif of
necrotic cell death. cells were then washed once by careful removal and addition of
mes and incubated at 221c in either mes, or mes in the presence of
the
differentiation factor dif-1 (dn1000, afﬁniti research products, exeter, uk) at a

lab-tek chambers were examined using an inverted zeiss axiovert 200 microscope
usually with a  100 oil-immersion objective. pictures were taken using an axiocam
mrc digital camera connected to a pc equipped with axiovision (zeiss). in some
cases, pictures were taken using a confocal microscope (zeiss axiovert 200,
lsm510) with a  63 oil
immersion objective, with the scanning module at
1024 1024 pixel resolution, 8 bits, using a scan average of 4, and argon/2 and
hene1 lasers with bp 505–530 and lp 560 ﬁlters. images were analyzed with lsm
software using false colors. images and time-lapse videos were transferred to a
macintosh computer and treated with graphic converter. figure assemblies were
carried out using freehand and illustrator.

measurement of cell membrane rupture. flow cytometry enables to
quantify the proportion of cells with a disrupted membrane. cells in lab-tek
chambers were resuspended and transferred to tubes and data acquisition was
performed on a facscan cytometer with cellquest software (becton dickinson)
for fsc and ssc parameters, which allowed to distinguish cells with a disrupted
membrane from those with an intact one. to exclude debris, an fsc threshold was
applied based on the light properties of the cells populations in fsc and ssc
modes. five thousand or 10 000 events were collected per sample. data analysis
was performed with cellquest software. in some experiments, cells were labelled
with pi (1 mg/ml, sigma) for 10 min before facs cytometry.
measurement of ﬂuorescence possibly revealing production of
reactive oxygen species. possible production of reactive oxygen species
was assessed by microscopy and ﬂow cytometry analysis. for each point of
analysis, cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, protected from light,
with either 20,70-dc-fda (10 mm, sigma-aldrich) or dihydrorhodamine 123 (1 mm,
sigma-aldrich). for microscopy, cells in lab-tek culture chambers were examined
directly after incubation by microscopy using filter set 09 (zeiss) for 20,70-dc-fda
and filter set 15 (zeiss) for dihydrorhodamine 123. for ﬂow cytometry, data
acquisition was performed directly after incubation, on a facscan cytometer with
cellquest software (becton dickinson) using fl1 ﬁlter. for acquisitions as a

measurement of atp levels. atp measurements were performed on 1 ml
of cell suspension (5 105 cells/ml). cells were lysed by three sonications of 5 s
(3w, ultrasonic processor, bioblock scientiﬁc) on ice, immediatly followed by the
addition of perchloric acid 70% (125 ml for 1 ml of cell suspension), mixing and
centrifugation at 41c for 5 min at 14 000 r.p.m. the supernatant was then collected
in a new tube and ph was adjusted to 7.0 with potassium hydroxide 8 n. after 30 min
on ice and 10 min centrifugation at 41c at 14 000 r.p.m., the supernatant was
collected in a new tube. the supernatant could be stored at  201c for later
measurement. atp levels present in the cellular extract was measured with atp
assay mix (flaam, sigma) by luminometry. results were expressed as amount of
atp per cell.
measurement of oxygen consumption. cells were starved overnight in
10 mm mes-na buffer, ph 6.4. in the presence of camp. aliquots (1 107 cells)
were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of mes-na buffer and
transferred to a thermostated oxygraphic cell ﬁtted with a clark oxygen electrode.
oxygen consumption was recorded as a function of time.
incubation with sugars. given sugars were added to starved cells in lab-
tek chambers, at the indicated ﬁnal concentrations, 30 min before the addition of
dif or of dnp or cccp. sugars were: d-(þ )-glucose (merck 1.083770250 or
sigma g 7528; these batches gave the same results), d-( )-fructose (sigma f
3510), d-(þ )-galactose (sigma g 0750), d-(þ )-mannose (fluka 63579), d-sorbitol
(sigma s 3889), sucrose (sigma s 0389), trehalose (sigma t 0299), 2-deoxy-d-
glucose (sigma d 6134) and 6-deoxy-d-glucose (sigma d 9761). after the indicated
duration of incubation, cells were checked by microscopy and/or by ﬂow cytometry.
