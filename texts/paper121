atg8, a member of a novel ubiquitin-like protein family, is an
essential component of the autophagic machinery in yeast. this
protein undergoes reversible conjugation to phosphatidylethanol-
amine through a multistep process in which cleavage of atg8 by
a specific protease is followed by ubiquitin-like conjugation
processes. here, we identify two essential sites in atg8, one of
them involving residues phe 77 and phe 79 and the other, located
on the opposite surface of atg8, residues tyr 49 and leu 50. we
show that these two sites are associated with different functions of
atg8: phe 77 and phe 79 seem to be part of the recognition site for
atg4, a cystein protease that acts also as a deubiquitination
enzyme, whereas tyr 49 and leu 50 act downstream of the
lipidation step. these two newly identified distinct sites that are
essential for atg8 activity provide an explanation for the many
protein–protein interactions of this low-molecular-weight protein.

introduction
the autophagic pathway mediates delivery of cytosolic proteins
and organelles for degradation within the lysosomes/vacuole
compartments. recent studies linked autophagy with numerous
physiological conditions,
including liver diseases, muscular
disorders, neurodegeneration, pathogen infections and cancer
(cuervo, 2004; shintani & klionsky, 2004a).
genetic screens
in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae
identified 16 autophagy-related genes (atgs) that are essential
for this process (klionsky et al, 2003). this group of genes includes
two unique ubiquitin-like (ubl) systems that take part in early
stages of autophagosome biogenesis (ohsumi & mizushima,
2004). the first includes atg12, a ubl molecule that is specifically

conjugated to atg5 to form a stable atg12–atg5 conjugate. this
process is mediated by both atg7, an e1-activating enzyme, and
atg10, an e2-conjugating enzyme. together with atg16, which
forms a complex with the atg12–atg5 conjugate (kuma et al,
2002), these molecules may act upstream of the second ubl
system that conjugates atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (pe;
ichimura et al, 2000). this lipidation process serves to associate
atg8 covalently with the isolation membrane and autophago-
somes, thus rendering it a genuine marker for these membranes.
the mechanism of autophagosome biogenesis remains enig-
matic, and the exact role of atg8 in this process is not yet fully
understood. this evolutionarily conserved molecule is part of a
novel protein family with many homologues in mammals (elazar
et al, 2003) and plants (yoshimoto et al, 2004), some of which are
specifically associated with autophagosomes (kabeya et al, 2004).
despite being a low-molecular-weight protein consisting of a
single ubl fold decorated by two amino-terminal short helices,
this protein is
recognized specifically by several proteins,
including the cysteine protease atg4 (kirisako et al, 2000), as
well as by atg7 and atg3, which subsequently direct it to pe on
the membrane (ichimura et al, 2000). here, we report
the
identification of two distinct functional sites that are required
for the autophagic activity of atg8.
(cvt; huang et al, 2000)
results and discussion
identification of essential residues on atg8
atg8 was initially identified as an essential protein for autophagy
(lang et al, 1998; kirisako et al, 1999) and for cytosol-to-vacuole
transport
in yeast. this protein first
becomes conjugated to pe, a process that starts with the removal
of the carboxy-terminal arginine from the newly synthesized atg8
by the atg4 protease to expose a c-terminal glycine residue
(atg8g116; kirisako et al, 2000). atg8g116 is then activated by atg7
(e1) and transferred to atg3 (e2), which conjugates it to pe by an
amide bond between the c-terminal glycine and the amino
group of pe (ichimura et al, 2000). the latter process is then
terminated by the deubiquitination activity of atg4. to clarify the
physiological role of this conjugation process, it is imperative,
first, to identify the functional domains on atg8 and, second,

to determine whether lipidation is the end point of atg8 role in this
process or whether it functions downstream of the conjugation
step. to address these questions, we undertook a systematic
mutagenesis approach aiming to identify the functional domains
of atg8.
atg8 shows significant amino-acid sequence homology to
a novel ubl mammalian protein family (fig 1a). the crystal
structures of
this family, namely gate-16,
gaparap and lc3, are almost identical (paz et al, 2000; knight
et al, 2002; sugawara et al, 2004). on the basis of these structures
and the sequence homology, we used swiss model to predict
three members of
the structure of atg8 with a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.)
value of 0.48 a˚
(fig 1b). we then systematically mutated the
conserved amino-acid residues located on the predicted protein
surface to alanine and tested the ability of
these mutants to
complement autophagy. autophagic activity was monitored in
datg8 cells using aminopeptidase i
(api) maturation under
nitrogen starvation. altogether, we mutated 13 amino acids,
including arg 20, arg 24, arg 28, lys 46, tyr 49, leu 50, tyr 62,
lys 66, phe 77, phe 79 and asp 100 (underlined in the atg8 amino-
acid sequence presented in fig 1a). nine of these mutations had
no effect on the protein activity. however, because of limitations

of the api assay, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of
these residues are involved in other autophagic activities of atg8.

we have introduced gfp–atg8 harbouring mutations at residues
phe 77 and phe 79 into datg8 cells. we have made use of api,
a vacuolar resident hydrolase that travels to the vacuole by means
of
the cvt pathway under normal growth conditions and by
autophagy under starvation conditions. its n-terminal propeptide

indicate that phe 77 and phe 79 are indispensable for both the cvt
and autophagy pathways.
to study further the role of these phenylalanine residues in
atg8 activity, we used different approaches to assess autophagy in
living cells. first, we tested the ability of gfp–atg8f77a, gfp–
atg8f79a and gfp–atg8f77/79a to complement starvation-induced
protein degradation in the datg8 cells. consistent with their
activity in the api maturation assay, both gfp–atg8f77a and gfp–
atg8f79a partly complemented starvation-induced protein degra-
dation, whereas the gfp–atg8f77/79a double mutant strain did not
(fig 2b). these results lend support to the idea that these two
adjacent phenylalanine residues are essential for autophagy.

gfp–atg8 has been localized to the cytosol and to a dot-like
structure, near
termed the pre-autophagosomal
structure (pas; suzuki et al, 2001). moreover, after starvation,

autophagy-dependent manner
therefore examined the subcellular
localization of wild-type
gfp–atg8 and the mutant gfp–atg8f77/79a in datg8 cells under
different growth conditions. as depicted in fig 2c, under control
conditions, wild-type gfp–atg8 is mainly localized to the cystosol
and the pas, whereas after starvation it accumulates within the
vacuole. in contrast, gfp–atg8f77/79a did not localize to the pas
and remained cytosolic even in starved cells. after delivery of
gfp–atg8 to the vacuole,
the gfp moiety is proteolytically
removed, and the free gfp can serve as a biochemical marker to
monitor vesicle delivery (shintani & klionsky, 2004b). the failure
of gfp–atg8f77/79a to undergo translocation to the vacuole was
further confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-gfp
antibodies (fig 2d). notably,
the vacuole in cells expressing
gfp–atg8f77/79a appeared slightly fragmented.
the inability of atg8f77/79a to support autophagic activities
may have resulted from defects in its processing machinery. to
test whether the aforementioned mutations affected c-terminal
cleavage by atg4 protease, haemagglutinin (ha) tag was fused
to the c terminus of the protein and expressed in the datg8
cells under normal and starvation conditions. as shown in fig 3a,
the c-terminal cleavage of the ha tag was not affected by the
mutation at residue phe 79, whereas mutation at residue phe 77
significantly inhibited cleavage under normal growth conditions
and, to a lesser extent, under starvation. cleavage of atg8f77/79a–
ha, however, was completely inhibited under both growth

conditions (fig 3a). similar
results were obtained when a
low-copy plasmid was used for the expression of atg8 (data not
shown). from these results, we concluded that both phe 77 and
phe 79 residues of atg8 are essential for cleavage by atg4 activity.
notably, these residues are found at the centre of an interface
surface predicted to participate in protein–protein interactions
(fig 3b; for details, see supplementary information online). to test
whether phe 77 and phe 79 participate in atg8–atg4 interaction,
recombinant atg4 tagged with six histidine residues at
its n
terminus was coupled to talon beads and used in a pull-down
assay with cell extracts obtained from the different strains. as
depicted in fig 3c, mutations in either phe 77 or phe 79
significantly reduced the binding of atg8 to atg4, whereas the
double mutant had a larger effect. atg8 was not detected in
eluates when the different extracts were incubated with talon
beads in the absence of atg4 (data not shown). these results
indicate that phe 77 and phe 79 are involved in atg8–atg4
interaction. consistently, overexpression of atg4 suppressed the
autophagic phenotype of atg8f77/79a (fig 3d,e). to test whether
residues phe 77 and phe 79 are also essential for the conjugation
process, we expressed the different mutants with the c-terminal
glycine exposed (atg8f77/79adr), thus overcoming the need for
the initial cleavage by the protease. as shown in fig 4a, both
atg8f77a and atg8f79a, but not atg8f77/79a, undergo pe lipidation
under starvation condition. notably, atg8f77/79a migrated in
the urea sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page)
slightly faster with a trail of a higher-molecular-weight band.
this phenomenon was previously reported for an uncleaved
protein (kirisako et al, 2000). atg8f77/79adr, conversely, was
lipidated (fig 4a),
these mutations specifically
affect the protease but not the conjugation machinery. this was
further confirmed by the ability of gfp–atg8f77/79adr to be
localized to the pas (fig 4b), a lipidation-dependent process.
these mutants, however,
failed to reconstitute autophagy in
the atg8-null strain (fig 4c), consistent with the notion that
deconjugation of atg8 by atg4 is essential

(kirisako et al, 2000).
indicating that
for
atg8 tyr 49 and leu 50 are essential for autophagy
as described in our initial screen, the two neighbouring residues
tyr 49 and leu 50 seemed to be essential for autophagy. to further
characterize the effect of these mutations on atg8 autophagic
activity, we expressed gfp–atg8 fusion protein containing these
mutations in datg8 cells. as shown in fig 5a, neither gfp–
atg8y49a nor gfp–atg8l50a restored api maturation under normal
or starvation conditions,
these mutants do not
support the cvt pathway or autophagy. to confirm the autophagic
defect in these mutants, we tested their ability to complement
starvation-induced protein degradation in datg8 cells. the
control, gfp–atg8wt,
fully complemented starvation-induced
protein degradation, whereas gfp–atg8l50a or gfp–atg8y49a
did not (fig 5b). these results confirm the essential role of tyr 49
and leu 50 in atg8 autophagic activity.

these results, we conclude that
to verify whether these mutants undergo cleavage in the c
terminus by atg4, datg8 and datg8datg4 cells were transformed
with atg8wt–ha, atg8l50a–ha or atg8y49a–ha fusion con-
structs in which the ha tag was introduced at the protein c
terminus. protein extracts were prepared from each strain,
subjected to sds–page and analysed by immunoblot with anti-
atg8 (fig 6c) and anti-ha antibodies (data not shown). both
atg8y49a–ha and atg8l50a–ha were cleaved at their c termini.
by using the datg8datg4 double knockout strain, we confirmed
the involvement of atg4 in this cleavage (fig 6c). on the basis
of
the mutations at residues
tyr 49 and leu 50 do not affect the c-terminal cleavage of the
protein by atg4, an essential step for the subsequent conjuga-
tion reaction. we next tested whether these mutants undergo
pe lipidation. for this purpose, atg8wt, atg8l50a and atg8y49a
were expressed in datg8 and datg8datg4 cells. cells were
grown under starvation conditions, and protein extracts were
prepared and subjected to 13.5% sds–page containing 6 m
urea. both mutants acquired the lipidated form, which migrated
faster only in the datg8 but not in the datg8datg4 cells (fig 6d).
moreover,
it has been reported that nascent atg8 (cleaved
by the atg4 protease) migrates more slowly on sds–page urea
gels (kirisako et al, 2000). consistently,
it seems that on
cleavage by atg4 protease, the unlipidated form of the wild-type
and mutant proteins of atg8 migrated more slowly in these
gels (fig 6d).

fig 6 | gfp–atg8 mutants were tested for their carboxy-terminus processing, phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation and autophagic activity. cells
expressing gfp–atg8wt or gfp–atg8 mutants were grown in control or starvation medium. (a) gfp–atg8 localization was determined using
fluorescence microscopy (arrows depict pre-autophagosomal structure, and arrowheads point to gfp within vacuoles). cells were also tested for the
appearance of autophagic bodies by using light microscopy. (b) immunoblot analysis of different cell extracts was carried out using anti-gfp
antibodies (asterisk represents nonspecific band). (c) atg8wt–ha, atg8l50a–ha or atg8y49a–ha was transformed into datg8 and datg8datg4 double
knockout strains and cell extracts were subjected to sds–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds–page) followed by immunoblot analysis using
anti-ha antibodies (lower panel; asterisk represents nonspecific band). (d) atg8wt, atg8l50a or atg8y49a was transformed into datg8 and
datg8datg4 double knockout strains and grown under control or starvation conditions for 4 h. cell extracts were subjected to 13.5% sds–page
containing 6 m urea, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-atg8-n15 antibodies. gfp, green fluorescent protein; wt, wild type.
cells were grown in the indicated medium to mid-exponential
phase, induced with 3.5% galactose and shifted to sd-n starvation
medium. to observe gfp-tagged proteins under a fluorescence
microscope, we employed a band filter of 505–525 nm.
