† background and aims the ﬂoral nectary of digitalis purpurea is a transitory organ with stomatal exudation of
nectar. in this type of nectary, the nectar is thought to be transported to the exterior via intercellular ducts that tra-
verse the nectariferous tissue. the latter is also traversed by a ramiﬁed system of phloem strands from which pre-
nectar sugar is most probably unloaded. the aims of this study were to provide some of the basic information needed
to evaluate the possible mechanism involved in nectar secretion and to discover the fate of the nectary.
† methods the ultrastructure of the nectary was investigated at different stages of development by analysis of a
series of ultrathin (7  1028 m) sections 7  1027 m apart from one another. proportions of the cells typical of
the nectary were documented by 3d-reconstruction and morphometry.
† key results the phloem consisted of variably shaped sieve elements and companion cells which, as a rule, were
more voluminous than the sieve elements. direct contact between the phloem strands and intercellular ducts was
observed. in contrast to the phloem, which remained structurally intact beyond the secretory phase, the nectariferous
tissue exhibited degenerative changes reminiscent of programmed cell death (pcd), which started as early as the
onset of secretion and progressed in a cascade-like fashion until ﬁnal cell death occurred in the exhausted
nectary. hallmarks of pcd were: increased vacuolation; increase in electron opacity of individual cells; progressive
incorporation of plasmatic components into the vacuole reminiscent of autophagy; degradation of plastids starting
with hydrolysis of starch; deformation of the nucleus and gradual disappearance of chromatin; loss of tonoplast
integrity and subsequent autolysis of the rest of cellular debris. degeneration of the cells occurred against a back-
ground of increasing cell size.
† conclusions the cytological and anatomical evidence presented here, and calculations of the solute ﬂuxes necess-
ary for accumulation of starch and for the production of nectar support the view that: (a) in the foxgloves’ nectary,
apoplastic phloem unloading dominates, at least during exudation of nectar; (b) the obsolete nectary may be dis-
mantled by pcd; and (c) at least the products of late nectary degradation are loaded via the apoplast into the
unchanged phloem and exported to sinks elsewhere in the plant for reallocation.

i n t ro d u c t i o n
although it is generally accepted that nectar originates from
phloem sap (frey-wyssling and agthe, 1950; fahn, 2000),
the ultrastructure of the phloem innervating nectaries has
received less attention than the ultrastructure of the nectar-
iferous tissue (secretory cells; nectary parenchyma). the
sugar-secreting nectaries are undisputedly sink organs
dependent on source tissue assimilates. most of them are
vascularized exclusively by phloem strands (frei, 1955).
therefore they typify model organs for the study of unload-
ing (release) phloem. the efﬂux of carbohydrates may
occur across plasma membranes of the sieve element –
companion cell
(apoplastic pathway) or
through plasmodesmata interlinking these complexes with
adjacent cells (symplastic pathway; patrick et al., 2001).

tural criteria indicating which unloading pathway is taken
in the ﬂoral nectary of digitalis purpurea during nectar
secretion, and (c) to discover the fate of the nectary after
it has fulﬁlled its temporary function. deletion of cells
that are no longer needed is one of the functions of pro-
grammed cell death (pcd) (pennell and lamb, 1997;
ranganath and nagashree, 2001). in view of the importance
attached by gray and johal (1998) to extensive microscopic
examination of the temporal sequence of subcellular events
that occur during pcd, this was tried with the nectary.

transport depends strongly on sieve tube radius, sieve tube

different stages of nectary development were chosen: (1)
just before the ﬁrst pair of
the onset of secretion,
anthers dehisced; (2) the peak period of secretion,
i.e.
during stigma receptivity; and (3) the cessation of secretion,
i.e. after the abscission of the corolla.
i.e.
preparation and analysis
for tem, small pieces (max. 1029 m3) of the nectaries
were treated for 1 h in collidine-buffered (50 mm) 2 % glutar-
aldehyde containing 5 mm cacl2 at room temperature. after
three 10-min rinses in collidine buffer plus 5 mm cacl2, the
samples were post-ﬁxed overnight in 2 % oso4 plus 0.8 %
k3fe3(cn)6 at 4 8c. after three 10-min rinses the samples
were stained en block for 2 h with 2 % aqueous uranyl
acetate and then rinsed again three times. after standard
dehydration and embedding (spurr, 1969) a series of thin
sections (7  1028 m thick) were cut on a reichert-jung
ultracut e microtome with a diamond knife (458 diatome,
balzers union). from this series only every tenth section
was collected and analysed. accordingly,
the distance
between adjacent sections was 7  1027 m.
(atari corp., sunnyvale, ca, usa). the
true-to-scale models were produced either by conven-
tional or by computer-aided 3d-reconstruction. in both
cases the proﬁles of the structures were ﬁrst traced onto
transparent paper. for conventional reconstruction, the pro-
ﬁles were projected and traced onto polystyrene sheets of
appropriate thickness. the cut-out polystyrene proﬁles
were then well-matched and glued together. the stepped
surface area was smoothed by trimming the edges of the
steps and by ﬁlling the remaining corners of the steps
with a paste of gypsum. after the gypsum was hard and
dry the models were painted. for
computer-aided
3d-reconstruction, all data processing took place using
the programs anat3d, edit3d and pic sum (genims
international, luxembourg) on an atari mega st4 compu-
x/y
ter
co-ordinates of the series of points placed along the proﬁles
were digitized using a cross-hair cursor of the digitizing
tablet (1st crp koruk, germany). by this way the proﬁles
of the structures were represented by polygons. the dis-
tance between adjacent proﬁles was 7  1027 m. the
reconstructions were rotated/scaled on the monitor screen
until the most instructive perspective was found by eye.
stereopairs were created by rotating the reconstructed
object along the vertical y-axis (3º to the left and 3º to
the right). the three-dimensional details of stereopictures
can be perceived by a stereoviewer or by naked-eye stereop-
sis. an easily learned technique for achieving unaided
stereoviewing was described by mckeon and gafﬁeld
(1990). polychromy enhanced the discrimination of differ-
ent structure elements. the same software was also used
for the morphometry.
r e s u lt s
ultrastructure of the nectary at the onset of secretion
a region of nectariferous tissue (nt) approx. 40 – 50 cells
wide was located below the epidermis (gaffal et al.,
1998). the latter was interspersed with permanently open
stomata (fig. 1). at the onset of secretion its cells were iso-
diametric and relatively small, making the nucleus appear
relatively large. the cytoplasm stained homogeneously.
apart from tiny septa the intercellular spaces were devoid
of structures (fig. 2). the nuclei were more or less rotund
with a smooth surface. in contrast to the more internally
located nucleolus, condensed chromatin was preferentially
located at the periphery, tightly attached to the nuclear
envelope (fig. 2). several cells of the nt had a spongy
appearance due to the presence of numerous smaller vacuo-
les that tended to be empty and to aggregate. the septa
between the vacuoles differed in thickness; the thinner
ones consisted of membranes only, the thicker ones were
ﬁlled with cytoplasm (¼plasmatic septa). other cells had
more voluminous vacuoles with inclusions that varied
considerably in size,
shape and structure from one
another. frequently these inclusions were membrane-
bound. occasionally irregularly shaped evaginations of
the
observed.
sporadically occurring transverse walls that were signiﬁ-
cantly thinner than mature cell walls indicated previous
cell divisions. the nectariferous cells (ncs) possessed
plastids
densely
stained starch grains (fig. 2). this was also the case with
the epidermis including its guard cells (not shown).

the alterations of
during secretion both the epidermal cells and the ncs
differed markedly in their staining properties (fig. 3).
consequently,
the cells were non-
synchronous. this made the chronological ordering of the
cytological events difﬁcult. although transition stages
existed,
the ultrastructural characteristics were classiﬁed
into three categories. (1) cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and
the endomembrane system were so electron opaque that
the compartmentation of the cell was hardly discernible.
the existence of vesicles, for example, was indirectly
indicated by their electron-transparent
lumina (fig. 3a,
cells e3, e4 and n1). (2) staining of the cytoplasm and

connected with the walls of n (arrow) thus ﬁxing p permanently open
(see also fig. 3b). similar connections and very small substomatal
spaces were also found in several cases in the modiﬁed stomata on the
ﬂoral nectary of vicia faba (a. r. davis, university of saskatchewan,

f i g. 2. ultrastructure of the nectariferous tissue of the d. purpurea nectary at the onset of secretion showing similar cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic
features of the cells. the vacuome consists of variously sized vacuoles (v). in particular the more voluminous vacuoles contain multiform inclusions

of chromatin (c) and starch grains (s). n, nucleoplasm. scale bar ¼ 5  1026 m.
nucleoplasm was moderately strong; except for vesicles, the
lumina of the rest of endomembrane system were heavily
stained (fig. 3b, cells n3 and n4). (3) staining of cyto-
plasm, nucleoplasm and endomembrane system was weak
by way of comparison (fig. 3b, cells n5 and n6).
generally, more voluminous vacuoles predominated over
aggregates of smaller ones. analysis of serial sections
revealed that most of the vacuoles found apparently separ-
ated in one section (fig. 3a) were joined in adjacent sec-
tions. it was repeatedly found that only a single large
vacuole existed. in addition to vacuolar inclusions resem-
bling those found at the onset of secretion, other types of
inclusions occurred: (a) more or less spherical structures
with variably arranged electron opaque deposits (figs 3
and 4f), (b) more or less dispersed electron-dense grana
(fig. 3a);
(fig. 4a, asterisk);
(d ) bizarre membranous structures (fig. 3a, asterisks);
and (e) scalloped lumps with an enigmatic internal structure
that had diameters of up to 3  1026 m (figs 4q – v).
(c) ﬂocculent material
in particular, the nuclei of the ncs tended to become ﬂat-
tened with a wavy outline. while the nucleoli remained
unchanged, a gradual weakening of the contrast between
chromatin and nucleoplasm occurred until the chromatin
vanished completely. the chromatin when still visible
was less often tightly attached to the nuclear envelope
(fig. 3).
small openings
the amyloplasts tended to approach the vacuole. at the
sites of contact, either membrane-bound evaginations
[42 + 20  1028 m
(fig. 4a – f) or
(+ s.d.); n ¼ 8] were repeatedly found. via these openings
at least the proximate starch grain appeared to be exposed to
the vacuole sap (fig. 4g – j). generally, the starch grains
were less electron dense than at the onset of secretion.
in addition to the plastid-associated evaginations, which
were electron translucent or ﬁlled with amorphous material
(fig. 4a – f), a great variety of other plasmatic evaginations
into the vacuole were found, the larger of which were
usually bounded by a double membrane (fig. 4d, n).
in the majority of epidermal, nectariferous and compa-
nion cells, the protoplast had retracted from the cell wall
leaving gaps between the wall and the plasma membrane.
these gaps occurred mainly where the plasmatic coat of
the vacuole was thin. they contained membranous connec-
tions between the wall and the plasma membrane
(figs. 4k – m), and/or membrane-bound vesicles (not
shown), and/or irregularly shaped membrane aggregates
(figs 3 and 5a), and/or heavy deposits of electron-opaque
material (fig. 4e, f, q–v).

intercellular spaces (i) are covered with granules. n, nucleoplasm. in (a) note the obviously opened septa between adjacent vacuolar spaces (arrowheads)
in e1 and e2, two of which are relatively thick (¼plasmatic septa). the electron opacity of the remains of the septum in e2 and the deposit attached to the
septum in e1 suggest steps of plasmatic septum degeneration. serial sections proved that the two vacuolar spaces seen in n1 belong to a single vacuole. in

the vascular supply entering the nt consisted of reticu-
lating phloem strands that terminated approx. 8 – 12 cell
layers below the epidermis (gaffal et al., 1998). most prob-
ably it is here that unloading occurs. diagnostic features of
the sieve elements (ses) are either the sieve plates by which
they are joined to each other or peculiar plastids (behnke,
1991), which in this case are of the ss-type (fig. 5a, e).
at the magniﬁcation usually used in the examination of
the secreting nectary, it was very difﬁcult to identify with
certainty the cells adjacent to the ses. two types of cells
were present: those that were similar in internal structure
to ncs and those that usually displayed maximum staining
of the cytoplasm and lacked starch grains. the latter
proved to be companion cells (ccs) not only by the
absence of starch but also by being linked with their ses
via pore – plasmodesma complexes (fig. 5e). there were

some of the gaps between the cell wall and the plasma
membrane (fig. 4f, q – v).

after cessation of nectar exudation, heterogeneity in cel-

(exclusive of guard cells) and the nt were devoid of plas-
tids, indicating that not only the starch but also other com-
ponents of the plastids had been hydrolysed during the
secretory stage. the ncs, now appearing more or less

(1330 2 4480  1029 m3), shape and contents from one

another. the mean
n ¼ 6) was almost double that of the ncs in the active
nectary (1199 + 319  1029 m3, gaffal et al., 1998).
frequently the interfaces of neighbouring ncs undulated
(fig. 5e). analysis of serial sections revealed that such
cells, by lacking a nucleus and a structurally intact cyto-
plasm, were nothing more than cell corpses. their lumina
contained variable aggregates of granules and lipid-like glo-
bules, which were obviously connected by remnants of the
plasmalemma (fig. 5b – e). however, some ncs still con-
tained a nucleus and a few mitochondria, with a single
central vacuole occupying most of their volume and with
the cytoplasm being conﬁned to a narrow peripheral layer
surrounding the vacuole. gaps between the cell wall and
plasma membrane were no longer found (fig. 5b). the
cytoplasm contained lipid-like globules that were devoid
of internal structure and did not appear to be membrane-
bound. although they tended to distend the tonoplast they
were not pinched off into the vacuole (fig. 5b, c), but
remained attached to cytoplasmic remnants until very late
in cytoplasmic degeneration. cytoplasmic collapse was pre-
ceded by loss of the tonoplast, detachment of the plasma
membrane from the cell wall and spread of the vacuolar
sap across the whole cell lumen (fig. 5d). mitochondria
and the usually ﬂattened nucleus seemed to be degraded
along with or immediately after the tonoplast. the majority
of intercellular spaces were again devoid of internal struc-
tures. occasionally, however,
lipid-like globules were
found (fig. 5b).
in contrast to the nt, the phloem innervation remained
almost unchanged. therefore, the ccs still rich in mito-
chondria could be easily identiﬁed (fig. 5b, e). it could
be shown that there was, on average, one cc for each se.
ultrastructural differences between the se-cc-cs of the
active and the exhausted nectary are restricted to an appar-
ent numerical increase of vacuolar inclusions in the ccs of
the exhausted nectary. the ses, however, displayed an
identical ultrastructure. the sieve plate pore diameter was
in the active nectary and
40 + 4  1028 m (n ¼ 19)
41 + 5  1028 m (n ¼ 29) in the exhausted nectary with
a plate thickness of 56 + 6  1028 m (n ¼ 16) and
58 + 7  1028 m (n ¼ 18),
respectively, and the total
pore area was approx. 50 % of the plate area. the pores
appeared to be ﬁlled with two differently stained com-
ponents: an electron-translucent callose collar surrounded
a darkly stained and irregularly shaped core (fig. 5a, e).
the ses not only displayed various shapes but they also
did not form straight ﬁles,
i.e. a zigzag path of sieve
tubes existed (figs 6 and 8b). the ses differed from one
another by the number of interfaces that they shared with
other ses. terminal ses were connected by only one
sieve plate with subterminal ses, whereas the latter and
other interstitial ses shared at least two sieve plates with
their neighbours. individual ses were shown to be in
contact with up to ﬁve other ses (fig. 7a).
the intercellular contact between ses and other types of
neighbouring cells was also variable. as a rule, ses were
in contact with more than one cc (fig. 7b). these inter-
faces, however, differed markedly in size. the largest inter-
face indisputably resulted from division of the mother cell
into the se-cc sisters. these sisters sometimes had almost

(a, b, e), the nectariferous cells (n) differ markedly in structure from one another. (a) note the sieve element-speciﬁc plastids (asterisks), sieve pores

lumen (l) of n4 and n10. note the high density of mitochondria (m) in c indicating the large energy need of companion cells, the extremely ﬂattened

mitochondria (arrows in n7). (c) serial section adjacent to that seen in (b). the globule (asterisk) appears to be isolated, but is not, as seen in (b). (d) n3

sink to source transition
according to the classiﬁcation of sinks into the categories
(i) consuming, (ii) accumulating, (iii) secreting (zamski,
1996), the nectary of d. purpurea changes from both a
consuming and accumulating body during growth and
starch deposition to a secreting one. during secretion the
nectary is not only a sink but it also becomes a source,
because a number of hallmark features that indicated the
onset of pcd were observed (see ‘hallmarks of pcd’).

(rubinstein, 2000; huelskamp and schnittinger, 2004).
there is reason to believe the ses and ccs remain
functional until very late, perhaps dying only after the
surrounding ncs have collapsed. the surviving phloem
appears to be involved in the uptake and export of products
of cellular catabolism from the dying nectary to sinks
elsewhere in the plant. in addition to senescing leaves and
corollas (matile and winkenbach, 1971; noode´n and
leopold, 1988; bieleski, 1995),
the nectary is another
example of the marked persistence of phloem activity in a
background of dying cells and the rapid reversal in sink –
source behaviour.
solute ﬂux necessary for nectar production
the nectar of d. purpurea was composed of 78.4 %
sucrose, 10.5 % glucose and 11.1 % fructose (lichius
et al., 1990). on average, the daily amount of nectar pro-
duced by one ﬂower of d. purpurea was 11.6 mg contain-
ing 16 – 27 % sugar (percival and morgan, 1965), 13.7 mg
containing 24 – 45 % sugar (halma´gyi and gulya´s, 1970),
and 11.1 mg containing 23.6 % sugar (assmann, 1986).
this is equivalent to about 470 2 1300 mm sucrose. the
lower concentration resulted from daily exploitation, thus
indicating that the sugar concentration of nascent nectar
is exposed to the

solute ﬂux necessary for starch production
in order to get an idea of the sucrose ﬂux necessary for
storage of starch, it was estimated that at the onset of
nectar secretion, 10 – 20 % of the volume of the nectary
(about 2  1029 m3) of d. purpurea is occupied by
i.e. a maximum of 4  10210 m3. by taking a
starch,
median density of starch (1.34 mg mm23), it is converted
to a maximum of 0.54 mg starch. because the amount of
energy per mass of starch (4.15 kcal g21 from maize) and
of sucrose (4.1 kcal g21) are almost equivalent to one
another (neumu¨ller, 1979), it can be roughly estimated
that 0.54 mg starch originates from about 0.54 mg of
sucrose. in this balance of energy the expenditure of
energy for the synthesis of starch from sucrose is not
taken into consideration. therefore this value is underesti-
mated to an unknown degree. however,
is
reduced because the calculation is with the upper limit of
starch content. because 3.6  1029 m3 of a 15 % solution
contain 0.54 mg sucrose, the phloem vasculature of the
nectary (2  10211 m3) has to be reﬁlled 180 times. it
appears that, similar
to starch accumulation in other
nectaries (razem and davis, 1999; peng et al., 2004), it
takes .1 d to deposit the starch. but even if this 1-d inter-
val is used, the rate of sucrose ﬂux during the accumulation
of starch would be at least three to seven times smaller than
during the secretion of nectar. hence, the sink strength of
the nectary seems to increase during secretion. the tempor-
arily enhanced sucrose unloading capacity may result either
from intensiﬁcation of the unloading system or from turning
on a speciﬁc efﬂux mechanism.
the error
origin of nectar
the coincidence of nectar secretion and degradation of
starch in the nt has been a well-known phenomenon for
more than a century (behrens, 1879). recently, nec1,
a gene predominantly expressed in the nectaries of petunia
hybrida, was cloned (ge et al., 2000). the pattern of
nec1 expression appeared to follow the temporal events
of starch hydrolysis, thus supporting the hypothesis that
nec1 is involved in the process of nectar secretion.
however, as early as 1886, stadler questioned the origin
of nectar in nectaries that lacked adequate quantities of
starch (stadler, 1886). he, and more recently horner
et al. (2003), suggested that such nectaries, after being
fed with ﬂuid nectar-producing precursors from sources
elsewhere in the plant, might secrete it directly without an
intermediate storage form of reserves. the calculations
above suggest that sugar originating from starch degradation
plays only a minor role in nectar production of d. purpurea.
the bulk of nectar seems to be directly unloaded from the
phloem sap. the decrease in nectar production after
reduction of the assimilate transport by girdling ﬂowering
shoots (von czarnowski, 1952; wykes, 1952) or by darken-
ing and defoliation experiments (von czarnowski, 1952;
pleasants and chaplin, 1983; nepi et al., 2005) strongly
favours the view that a good deal of nectar is supplied
from the current assimilate ﬂux.

higher concentrations due to evaporation of water. in the
phloem sap, sugar (in most species almost exclusively
sucrose) also reached very high levels, usually ranging
from 200 to 1600 mm (winter and huber, 2000). assuming
that (a) sugar concentration in nascent nectar is 440 mm,
one ﬂower may secrete 15 – 30  1029 m3 nectar a day,
(b) the nascent nectar and the phloem sap coincide in
sucrose concentration, and (c) that only the 78.4% share
of sucrose in the nectar originates from the phloem sap,
then approx. 118 – 236  10210 m3 phloem sap has to be
translocated per day via the phloem vasculature of the
nectary. the volume of the nectary is approx. 2  1029 m3
(gaffal et al., 1998), but only a small fraction is allotted to
the sieve tubes. estimating 1%, then nectar secretion loads
new sap to the extent that the entire volume of the sieve
tubes must be reﬁlled 590 – 1180 times per day.

morphotype of the nectary phloem
morphometry established that the ccs of the phloem
strands innervating the ﬂoral nectaries of d. purpurea and
isoplexis canariensis (gaffal and el-gammal, 2003) are
typically more voluminous than the ses. a similar ratio in
size is not only evident from studies on other nectaries
(ﬁg. 3 in figier, 1971; findlay and mercer, 1971; durkee
et al., 1981; durkee, 1983; davis et al., 1986, 1988;
razem and davis, 1999; ﬁg. 3 in zhu and hu, 2002; wist
and davis, 2006) but also from studies on the vasculature
of other sink tissues. ccs at least as wide as the ses were
found in the unloading phloem of
the rice pericarp
(oparka and gates, 1981), in the minor bundle of the devel-
oping apple fruit (ﬁg. 7a, c in peng et al., 2003), and in the
phloem feeding the pericarp and the cotyledons (named
‘seed pericarp’) of developing walnut fruit (ﬁg. 2 in wu
et al., 2004). the large size of the ccs relative to the ses
in special regions of phloem unloading is the reverse of
that found in the transport phloem, but quite similar to
that of leaf minor veins (for instance, haritatos et al.,
2000), where phloem loading occurs. the large size of
the ccs is thought to reﬂect their active role not only in
phloem loading (barth et al., 2003), but also in the unload-
ing process (oparka and gates, 1981; findlay, 1988).
ramiﬁcation of the phloem innervation causing bifur-
cation of the solute ﬂux necessitates at least tripolar ses.
multipolar (more than tripolar) ses are junctions where
solute inﬂow from more than one se and solute outﬂow
into more than one se can meet. the amount of inﬂow
from and outﬂow into adjacent ses seems to depend on
the number of sieve pores per interface. solute distribution
may be controlled in this way. multipolar ses interlinked
via sieve plates with more than two ses are known from
leaf veins
(koch, 1884) and from wound phloem
(eschrich, 1953, schulz, 1986). the sieve tubes of the
latter, obviously an unloading phloem, are zigzag shaped,
found
in
the
nectar
phloem elements in contact with intercellular spaces
were found not only in this and more recent studies on nec-
taries of (a) helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus (ﬁg. 5 in
sammataro et al., 1985); (b) vicia faba (davis et al., 1988);
(c) pisum sativum (razem and davis, 1999); (d ) isoplexis
canariensis (gaffal and el-gammal, 2003); (e) echinacea
purpurea (wist and davis, 2006), but also more than a
century ago. intercellular ducts abutting the vasculature of
the nectary of serratula lycophila were interpreted to be
involved in the secretion of nectar (von wettstein, 1889).
in the nectaries of paeoniaceae (zimmermann, 1932;
frey-wyssling and ha¨usermann, 1960; hiepko, 1966)
cells of the so-called ‘conducting tissue’ [leitparenchym
(obviously phloem elements)] even adjoined the substoma-
tal spaces of those ‘stomata’ (discusspalten) through which
the nectar escaped to the outside. this structural specializ-
ation, which most probably also exists in helianthus (ﬁg. 5
in sammataro et al., 1985), indicated the possibility of a
direct unloading of assimilates from the phloem to the
exterior of the plant (zimmermann, 1932; hiepko, 1966;
schnepf, 1973), and might also explain why exclusively
of paeonia
sucrose was
(frey-wyssling and ha¨usermann, 1960). a sucrose-
dominant nectar is also secreted from the petal
tip of
medinilla magniﬁca (tobe et al., 1989). there any nt
(nectary parenchyma) is missing, but the associated vascu-
lar bundle consisting of phloem only is thickened. this ana-
tomical evidence again indicates that the nectary is the
phloem-rich median petal bundle itself. although it
remains to be proven that the reticulum of intercellular
spaces terminating at the permanently open stomata of the
nectary (gaffal et al., 1998) is connected with the reticulum
of intercellular spaces arriving at the phloem strands, there
is a good chance for the existence of continuity. two funda-
mental differences exist between the nectaries of paeonia
and medinilla on the one hand, and d. purpurea on the
other hand. (1) the length of the path the nectar has to
pass through the intercellular space of the nt until it is dis-
charged to the surface of the nectary via the modiﬁed
stomata is much longer in the nectary of d. purpurea. the
chemical composition of the nectar may be altered along
this passage. for instance, invertases located in the cell
wall boundary of
spaces may form
glucose and fructose from the raw material of the nascent
nectar (sucrose). (2) starch in the nectary parenchyma is
hydrolysed during secretion, and sugars originating from
this decomposition may enter the intercellular spaces and
inﬂuence the chemical composition of the nectar.
the intercellular
intercellular spaces that abut against phloem elements are
not limited to nectaries. they were clearly seen (a) between
604
gaffal et al. — programmed cell death in the nectary of digitalis
unloading phloem cells of
the developing apple fruit
(ﬁg. 7a, c in peng et al., 2003), (b) in minor veins of devel-
oping tobacco leaves (ﬁg. 4 in wright et al., 2003), (c) in
minor veins of the leaves of transgenic potato plants
(ﬁgs 18 and 19 in schulz et al., 1998) and (d ) in adaxial
minor veins of cucurbita pepo leaves (ﬁg. 3 in turgeon
and webb, 1976), which were suggested to constitute the
preferential pathway for the import of assimilates.
the apoplast of the secreting nectary
during secretion the intercellular space of the nectary is
most probably ﬁlled with nascent nectar. positive staining
for carbohydrates indicated their presence in the intercellu-
lar spaces of the extraﬂoral nectaries of australian acacias
(marginson et al., 1985). because the prenectar has to
pass the cell wall, we think that the sugar concentrations
of the ﬂuid in the wall apoplast and in the intercellular
space are identical. accordingly,
the sink end of the
phloem pathway may be surrounded by an apoplast solution
with a concentration of osmotically active solutes not dras-
tically different from that of the phloem sap. therefore,
unloading of sucrose from the phloem pathway that
is
driven by large transmembrane concentration differences
seems to play a minor role. high sucrose concentration in
the cell wall apoplast favours an energy-dependent and
possibly carrier-mediated process as postulated for strong
sinks (wolswinkel, 1985), such as ripening grape berries
(wang et al., 2003). in theory, the unloading of sucrose
into the apoplast could occur by speciﬁc efﬂuxers that
either use a proton antiport mechanism or are directly ener-
gized by atp (lalonde et al., 2004). atp-ase activity was
detected by cytochemistry in the phloem tissue adjacent to
the nectaries of gossypium (eleftheriou and hall, 1983)
and hibiscus (sawidis, 1991).
the mechanisms of nectar
secretion proposed by
vassilyev (2003) and koteyeva et al. (2005) were based
on the idea that the apoplast of the nt forms the main
route taken by the nectar sugars on their way to the stomatal
opening. although the actual direction faced by the wall
ingrowths of the nectary ccs (which are transfer cells) of
vicia faba (davis et al., 1988) clearly suggested an
avenue for unloading of pre-nectar constituents directly to
intercellular spaces (i.e. apoplast), vassilyev (2003) and
koteyeva et al. (2005) either ignored the ccs of the
nectary phloem or assigned them only a passive role in
assimilate transport. except for the substomatal cavity,
vassilyev’s ﬁg. 1 also lacked intercellular spaces. in contra-
diction to this model,
the sites of open access of the
se-cc-cs to the intercellular system were considered to
be the shortest pathways for an apoplastic efﬂux of assimi-
lates (gaffal and heimler, 2000).
hallmarks of pcd
during secretion and the ﬁnal degradation phase of the
nectary, a number of hallmark features arise that are remi-
nescent of autophagy and autolysis. these symptoms are
common in plants and appeared during normal pericarp
development and may therefore indicate developmental
pcd (dangl et al., 2000; van doorn and woltering,
2005). the phenotype of pcd in the foxglove’s nectary is
deﬁnitively very similar to that in the nectary of glycine
max (horner et al., 2003), and to the phenotype of senes-
cence in the petals of ipomoea (matile and winkenbach,
1971), dianthus (smith et al., 1992) and hemerocallis
(stead and van doorn, 1994). senescence is considered to
be a type of pcd (noode´n, 2004). the sequence of cell
degeneration discussed here is an interpretation without
independent conﬁrmation that one stage neccessarily leads
to another.
(a) increased vacuolation. one of the earliest events
observed is the fusion of smaller vacuoles, which culmi-
nates in the formation of a single central vacuole. this
obviously occurs by rupture or degradation of the tonoplast-
coated septa between adjacent vacuolar spaces (figs 3a and
4a, e, f). some of the vacuolar inclusions seem to orig-
inate from these events. further enlargement of
the
central vacuole is associated with the extension growth of
the dying but
expanding ncs. the ncs of
eccremocarpus scaber also increased 2-fold in volume
et al., 1994).
during their development
signiﬁcant changes in the vacuome, usually in the form
of increased vacuolation, were widely reported in plant
pcd (rogers, 2005).
(belmonte
still
(b) autophagy. vacuolar inclusions also seem to originate
from the pinching off of plasmatic evaginations into the
vacuole. with progression through the pcd process, incor-
poration of plasmatic components
into the vacuole
increases in number. degradation of vacuolar inclusions
seems to occur through autophagy. in dying plant cells
there
autophagy
(krishnamurthy et al., 2000). autophagic pcd is normally
used for recycling cellular components (lam, 2004), since
progressive elimination of cytoplasm by hydrolysis in vacu-
oles extends the survival of the dying cell and efﬁcient
withdrawal of nutrients from the cells can be achieved
(jones, 2000; mittler and cheung, 2004).
evidence

ample
(c) degradation of plastids. the decrease in electron
opacity of the starch grains is the ﬁrst obvious symptom
of starch degradation. the coincident occurrence of small
gaps between the vacuole and the interior of the amyloplast
may allow leakage of vacuolar sap into this organelle.
evidence that the vacuole represents the lytic compartment
of plant cells that contains hydrolytic enzymes has been
largely established by matile (1975). the products of
hydrolase activity can, on the other hand, be released into
the vacuole via these gaps. as long as they are small, diges-
tion may be under control and homeostasis maintained. if
this idea and the widely accepted idea that the sugars pro-
duced by starch lysis enter the nectar are true, then these
sugars must pass at least two membranes – the tonoplast
and the plasma membrane ( plasmalemma). in contrast to
the open access of the vacuolar sap to the interior of the
amyloplasts, indicated by the present study, engulﬁng of
the plastids by the vacuole and subsequent hydrolysis of
starch in the vacuole were described in the ﬂoral nectaries
of eccremocarpus saber (belmonte et al., 1994) and
gaffal et al. — programmed cell death in the nectary of digitalis
605
cucumis sativus (peng et al., 2004), and in senescing
french bean leaves (minamikawa et al., 2001).
accumulation of the products of starch degradation in the
vacuole may serve one more transient function. if the sugar
concentration in the apoplast of the nectary is at least
440 mm (see ‘solute ﬂux necessary for nectar production’),
a signiﬁcant osmotic stress exists. these apoplastic solutes
will lower cell turgor and cause plasmolysis. transient local
detachment of the protoplasts from the cell wall indicates
such an event. as the toxic effect of prolonged plasmolysis
will cause premature death, an increase in the solute con-
centration in the vacuole will counterbalance too much
loss of water in order to facilitate extension growth of the
ncs by enlargement of the vacuole, and provide adequate
turgor for effective pcd, which is a slowly proceeding
process (van doorn and woltering, 2005).
(d) nuclear changes. deformation of the nuclei and
gradual disappearance of chromatin were found in this
study to be relatively early symptoms of nuclear degra-
dation. changes in nuclear shape were also observed in
dying cells of the tapetum (papini et al., 1999) and the
nucellus (greenwood et al., 2005). however, the ultimate
breakdown is a relatively late event, just as in most senes-
cing cells (noode´n and leopold, 1988).
(e) intensiﬁcation of electron opacity. the increase in the
osmiophilic properties of the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and
contents of
the endomembrane system correlates with
the occurrence of osmiophilic particles at the periphery of
the protoplast, in the gaps between the cell wall and the
plasma membrane,
spaces.

characteristic increases in cytoplasmic density were also

degeneration of the tobacco synergid (huang et al., 1993).

(f ) disintegration of the tonoplast. as degradation of the
nt advances to its end point, tonoplast integrity is lost.
dissolution and subsequent release of hydrolytic enzymes
into the vestiges of cytoplasma, which promote ﬁnal cell
death, are common features of plant pcd (jones, 2000;
moriyasu and klionsky, 2004; noode´n, 2004). eventually
total autolysis of the remaining cytoplasmic constituents
ensues, ending with leakage of the catabolites into the apo-
plast (lam, 2004), from which they may be loaded into the
structurally intact phloem and exported to sinks elsewhere
in the plant. the breakdown of the remaining mitochondria
seems to coincide with the breakdown of the tonoplast. the
lipid-like globules, whose origin and function are comple-
tely unknown, and the plasma membrane, are among the
most persistent cellular components.
the fate of the cell walls of the nt
the breakdown of cellular contents is paralleled by the
occurrence of wavy cell walls. this buckling is followed
by further collapse of the nc corpses as a result of forces
exerted by the swelling fruit. ensuing nectar secretion
degeneration and the collapse of ncs was also observed
in glycine max (horner et al., 2003) and hexisea imbricata
(stpiczyn´ska et al., 2005). cell walls are typically not
eliminated during pcd in plants (mittler, 1998), and crush-
ing, tearing or overgrowth of dead cells by their expanding
neighbours is one of their fates (beers, 1997). the fact that
cell walls are not degraded may reﬂect an energetic budget
that is too high (gray and johal, 1998) or the cell walls
perform specialized functions such as mechanical support
or water transport (krishnamurthy et al., 2000). we think
that once the mission of the nectary is accomplished, it
alters to a mode in which not only resource mobilization
but also defence should be the most important goals for
preservation of the next generation. the production of a
physical barrier composed of compressed cell walls and
collapsed intercellular spaces may inhibit the invasion of
pathogens via the permanently open stomata into living
parts of the ovary. nectar clearly represents a preferred
medium for bacterial and fungal growth (fig. 3b), and
the bacterial pathogen erwinia amylovora is known to
follow this route during infection (buban et al., 2003).
future directions
pcd is usually regarded as a genetically encoded active
process that performs a detectable function in the life of the
plant (gunawardena et al., 2005). if nectary death is cor-
rectly interpreted as programmed, a genetic control can be
expected. in this case nectaries could be excellent model
systems for the study of fundamental cell death processes,
because the whole natural period from maturity to death
is relatively short. in particular the nectaries of species
that lend themselves readily to genetic manipulation, muta-
genesis or transformation, such as arabidopsis thaliana,
may be employed. enlargement of the vacuoles in the post-
secretory nectary of arabidopsis thaliana (davis, 1994) and
the ultrastructural changes observed during degeneration of
the nt (zhu and hu, 2002) seem to be hallmarks of pcd.
genetic analysis using arabidopsis mutants that show
abnormalities in nectary morphology – as for instance the
petal
loss-1 ( ptl-1) mutation (bowman, 1994) – may
provide clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying
pcd in the nectary.
