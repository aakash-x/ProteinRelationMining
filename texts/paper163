autophagy is a catabolic membrane-trafﬁcking mechanism conserved in all eukaryotic cells. in addition to the nonselec-
tive transport of bulk cytosol, autophagy is responsible for efﬁcient delivery of the vacuolar enzyme ape1 precursor
(prape1) in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting the presence of a prape1 sorting machinery.
sequential interactions between atg19-atg11 and atg19-atg8 pairs are thought responsible for targeting prape1 to the
vesicle formation site, the preautophagosomal structure (pas), and loading it into transport vesicles, respectively.
however, the different patterns of prape1 transport defect seen in the atg11⌬ and atg19⌬ strains seem to be incompatible
with this model. here we report that prape1 could not be targeted to the pas and failed to be delivered into the vacuole
in atg8⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout cells regardless of the nutrient conditions. we postulate that atg19 mediates a dual
interaction prape1-sorting mechanism through independent, instead of sequential, interactions with atg11 and atg8. in
addition, to efﬁciently deliver prape1 to the vacuole, a proper interaction between atg11 and atg9 is indispensable. we
speculate that atg11 may elicit a cargo-loading signal and induce atg9 shuttling to a speciﬁc pas site, where atg9 relays
the signal and recruits other atg proteins to induce vesicle formation.
introduction
autophagy, as a membrane-trafﬁcking mechanism con-
served in all eukaryotic cells, is essential to the survival of
unicellular organisms in nutrient starvation conditions.
through a double-membrane–bound vesicle, called an au-
tophagosome, autophagy mediates the degradation of
cytosolic components in the lysosome/vacuole and recycles
basic building blocks for new macromolecular synthesis or
to serve as energy sources (onodera and ohsumi, 2005;
yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005b). because nutrient starvation
stimulates autophagosome formation and the contents of
autophagosomes resemble their surrounding cytoplasm, au-
tophagy has long been considered to be a nonselective cat-
abolic pathway for bulk cytosol remodeling. recent studies,
however, have provided evidence for selective cargo trans-
port by autophagosomes. for example, intracellular infec-
tious pathogens are enveloped by autophagosomes and
killed upon fusion of the vesicles with lysosomes (gutierrez
et al., 2004; nakagawa et al., 2004; ogawa et al., 2005). in
autophagy-deﬁcient neuronal cells, intracellular protein ag-
gregates accumulate, which may interfere with neural func-
tion and eventually lead to neurodegeneration (hara et al.,
2006; komatsu et al., 2006). moreover, autophagy selectively
eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria to reduce the pro-
duction of reactive oxygen species (ros) and apoptosis (gu
et al., 2004). all these autophagic functions rely on speciﬁc

signal transduction events and precise cargo-sorting mech-
anisms to load autophagosomes with appropriate cytosolic
materials for elimination. deciphering these mechanisms in
molecular detail is critical to the control of autophagy-re-
lated human diseases, but our current knowledge on these
issues is still limited. thus, it is important to study the
process of autophagy in an experimentally more amenable
model system, such as yeasts.
in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, several ex-
amples of selective autophagy to mediate vacuolar delivery
of speciﬁc cargo have been reported. by switching cells to
glucose medium, the numerous peroxisomes induced by
culturing cells in lipid-containing medium become superﬂu-
ous and are targeted to the vacuole for degradation via the
pexophagy pathway (hutchins et al., 1999; dunn et al., 2005).
the vacuolar enzyme aminopeptidase i (ape1) and ␣-man-
nosidase (ams1) are selectively delivered by starvation-in-
duced autophagosomes (hutchins and klionsky, 2001;
huang and klionsky, 2002). when cells are cultured in nu-
trient-rich growth conditions, precursors of ape1 (prape1)
is transported by another mechanism, named the cytoplasm-
to-vacuole targeting (cvt) pathway, a selective trafﬁcking
pathway that is topologically similar to autophagy and relies
on most of the same molecular machinery. in fact, prape1 is
known to induce cvt vesicle formation in growing cells
(shintani and klionsky, 2004). therefore, the cvt pathway of
budding yeast may better mimic the process of mammalian
selective autophagy because cells in a multicellular organ-
ism may not face signiﬁcant nutrient starvation conditions,
and mammalian selective autophagy induced by deleterious
cytosolic components is likely not associated with starvation
signals. studies on the induction signaling and cargo-sorting
molecular mechanisms for the cvt pathway will provide
insight for future work on the mammalian system.
mutant screens have identiﬁed several gene products re-
quired for efﬁcient import of prape1 into the vacuole. be-

cause most of these mutants are also defective in execution
of starvation-induced general autophagy, they are named
autophagy-related (atg) genes (klionsky et al., 2003). ex-
amining the characteristics of prape1 and the phenotypes of
atg mutant strains, has led to our current understanding on
prape1 import mechanism as summarized below. after syn-
thesis in the cytosol, prape1 quickly forms a homo-do-
decamer and then further assembles into a larger cvt com-
plex (kim et al., 1997). atg19, serving as the receptor, binds
to the propeptide of prape1 and mediates targeting of the
cvt complex to the perivacuolar vesicle formation site, the
preautophagosomal structure (pas; scott
et al., 2001;
shintani et al., 2002). most atg proteins are then recruited to,
and regulate vesicle formation from, the pas (suzuki et al.,
2001; kim et al., 2002). finally, completely assembled vesi-
cles encapsulate and transport prape1 together with its
receptor atg19 to the vacuole. in growing ape1⌬ and atg19⌬
cells, atg proteins are inefﬁciently recruited to the pas,
indicating that the pas-targeted prape1-atg19 complex
likely elicits a signal to regulate the pas and cvt vesicle
formation. consequently, identifying the component that
interacts with the cvt complex at the pas is critical to unveil
the molecular mechanism of the cvt pathway and selective
autophagy regulation.
in an atg11⌬ strain, the prape1-atg19 complex is found
away from the perivacuolar pas, which results in a block of
prape1 transport, whereas general autophagy induction by
starvation is not affected (kim et al., 2001b; yorimitsu and
klionsky, 2005a). atg11 encodes a large protein with four
potential coiled-coil (cc) domains. the atg11 c terminus,
including its fourth cc domain (cc4), is responsible for
interaction with atg19. other parts of atg11 are involved in
homo-oligomer formation or interaction with other atg pro-
teins. the exact timing and subcellular locations of these
interactions are not known, but atg11 and its interacting
partners are seen colocalized at the pas. these atg11 fea-
tures and the atg11⌬ strain phenotypes indicate its critical
role in delivering prape1-atg19 to the pas and subse-
quently initiating a signal for cvt vesicle formation. an
interaction partner for atg11 is likely located at the pas to
dock with and transduce signals from the incoming cargo
complex, but the identity of such a component is still not
clear. among those pas-associated atg proteins, atg9 is the
only one with transmembrane domains (noda et al., 2000).
atg9 recruits atg2 and atg18 to the pas (wang et al., 2001;
reggiori et al., 2004). while fulﬁlling its autophagy regula-
tory function, atg9 cycles between subcellular punctate
compartments and the pas. although the exact role of atg9
cycling is still a question, this cycling behavior is blocked
and atg9 accumulates at the pas in atg1⌬ and several other
atg mutant strains. interestingly, atg9 is not restricted to the
pas in growing atg1⌬ ape1⌬ double knockout cells (shintani
and klionsky, 2004). these data suggest that atg9 may
participate in an early event for loading prape1 cargo or
integrating signals for control of vesicle formation at the
pas.
in this present study, we have characterized an atg19-
mediated dual interaction prape1 sorting mechanism and
found atg9 as the partner for interaction with atg11 to relay
the cargo-loading signal at the pas. the domains required
for atg11-atg9 interaction have been mapped. properties of
atg11 and atg9 variants, which lost interaction with each
other, indicate the critical role for a proper atg11-atg9 in-
teraction to initiate cvt vesicle formation. in addition, atg9
distribution patterns seen in different mutant backgrounds
suggest that in the absence of the prape1 cargo, atg11 still
affects the appearance of multiple perivacuolar pas sites in
starved cells.

strains and media
the s. cerevisiae yeast strains used in this study are listed in table 1. for gene
disruptions, the entire coding region was replaced with either the escherichia
coli kanr, schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 , ors. cerevisiae trp1 genes using pcr
primers containing ⬃40 bases of identity to the regions ﬂanking the open
reading frame (orf). yeast cells were grown in ypd (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 2% glucose) or synthetic medium (sd; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base
without amino acids, 2% glucose, auxotrophic amino acids, and vitamins if
necessary). for nitrogen starvation, sd-n medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base
without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose) was used.
plasmids
for the two-hybrid analysis, we used the system developed by james et al.
(1996). the prey plasmid pgad-atg9 or its truncated versions were con-
structed by ligating the corresponding atg9 orf fragments into xmai and

psti sites of pgad-c3. the bait plasmid pgbdu-atg11 or truncated versions
were constructed by inserting the full-length or the truncated atg11 orf into
the bamhi and sali sites of pgbdu-c3. atg9 or the truncated atg9 orf
were generated by pcr and ligated into xmai and xhoi sites of pcuprota,
pcu3xha, pcurfp, and pcugfp. the pcr products of the truncated atg11
orf were inserted into the spei and kpni restriction sites of prs424. for the
plasmid expressing gfp-ape1, the ape1 orf was ampliﬁed by pcr and
ligated into xmai and clai sites of pcugfp. the dna fragment encoding rfp
was inserted into the spei and xmai sites of pcu414-cvt9 to generate a
plasmid expressing the rfp-atg11 fusion protein. plasmids for expressing
gfp-atg5 and gfp-atg8 have been described elsewhere (george et al., 2000;
kim et al., 2001a).
protein a pulldown
the cells harboring plasmids expressing protein a, prota-atg9, or prota-
truncated atg9 and myc-atg11 or truncated atg11 were converted into
spheroplasts and then lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm hepes-koh, ph 6.8,
150 mm koac, 5 mm mgoac, 250 mm sorbitol, 0.5%triton x-100, 1 mm
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride [pmsf], complete edta-free protease inhib-
itor; roche diagnostics, alameda, ca). after being centrifuged at 800 rpm for
5 min, the cell lysate was incubated with human igg–coated dynabeads
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) at 4°c for 3 h. the resultant protein complexes
were eluted by sds-page sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting
with anti-myc antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) or rabbit
pap (dako, carpinteria, ca).
alkaline phosphatase assay
the system we used was adapted from a previous report (noda et al., 1995).
brieﬂy, cells starved for 4 h were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm
pipes, ph 6.8, 50 mm kcl, 100 mm koac, 10 mm mgso4, 10 ␮m znso4, 1
mm pmsf, and 0.5% triton x-100) by glass beads. autophagic activity was
estimated with p-nitrophenol phosphate (p-npp) as substrate. protein concen-
tration was measured by pierce bca assay (pierce chemical, rockford, il).
analysis of pexophagy activity
the degradation of peroxisomes was determined by the loss of thiolase (fox3)
as described previously (hutchins et al., 1999).
fluorescence microscopy
yeasts cells expressing ﬂuorescent proteins were grown to midlog phase and
shifted to sd-n medium as needed. for labeling vacuolar membrane, the cells
were incubated with 0.8 ␮m n-(triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethyl-
aminophenylhexatri-enyl) pyridinium (fm 4-64) at 30°c for 20 min. after
being washed by medium once, the cells were incubated in ypd at 30°c for
30–45 min and collected for observation.

atg19 mediates a dual interaction prape1-sorting
mechanism
current information on the molecular mechanism of prape1
sorting indicates that atg19 facilitates this process by ﬁrst
associating with prape1 to form a prape1-atg19 cvt com-
plex, and then sequentially interacting with atg11 and atg8
to load the cvt complex into transport vesicles (scott et al.,
2001; shintani et al., 2002). mutations in any one of these
components should inevitably result in blockage of prape1
import. however, paradoxically, this prape1 import defect
is partially reversed in nutrient starvation–treated atg8⌬ and
atg11⌬ cells, whereas an atg19⌬ strain does not show this
reversal phenotype (abeliovich et al., 2000; kim et al., 2001b).
these data indicate that only atg19, but not its two interac-
tion partners, is essential for prape1 transport by autopha-
gosomes. because the atg8 expression level and its conju-
gation to phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) is increased under
starvation stress (huang et al., 2000; ichimura et al., 2000), we
suspected that interaction between atg19 and increased lev-
els of atg8-pe could bypass the atg11-dependent event and
cause the reversal phenotype of an atg11⌬ strain. as a con-
sequence, we proposed that by independent, instead of se-
quential, interaction with atg11 and atg8, atg19 mediates
prape1 sorting by a dual interaction mechanism (figure
1a).

bypasses the atg11-dependent event. (b) double mutation in

to test this dual interaction sorting proposal, we ﬁrst
examined whether atg8⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout cells
showed a synergistic effect in blocking the reversal pheno-
type of the prape1 import defect. after overnight incubation
the corresponding mutants in nitrogen starvation medium,
both atg8⌬ and atg11⌬ cells generated a signiﬁcant amount
of mape1, whereas atg8⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout cells still
had a complete block in prape1 import (figure 1b). because
atg1⌬ cells also did not generate mape1 by this prolonged
starvation treatment, transport by autophagosomes was
likely responsible for the reversal phenotype, and this result
seemed to support our proposal. however, an atg8⌬ strain is
known to have limited autophagy activity and assembles
abnormally small autophagosomes (abeliovich et al., 2000).
this atg8 defect in combination with the atg11 mutation may
account for the synergistic effect we observed instead of
indicating a direct involvement of atg8 in prape1 sorting by
interaction with atg19. to exclude this possibility, we
sought to re-examine this phenomenon in a genetic back-
ground with normal autophagy functions.
our strategy to conduct this experiment relied on the fact
that a 10-residue deletion from the carboxy terminus of
atg19 (atg19⌬10c) is enough to block its interaction with
atg8 (shintani et al., 2002). to use atg19⌬10c for our pur-
pose, we generated an atg11⌬ atg19⌬ double knockout
strain. expressing atg19⌬10c in this strain should eliminate
the atg19-atg11 and atg19-atg8 interactions without com-
promising general autophagy execution. the ability of this
atg11⌬ atg19⌬ strain to induce autophagy after long- and
short-term starvation was ﬁrst conﬁrmed by analyzing sur-
vival and pho8⌬60 activity, respectively. the survival of the
double knockout cells under nitrogen starvation conditions
was similar to that seen with the atg11⌬ cells (figure 1c).
cytosolically accumulated pho8⌬60 was delivered to, and
activated in, the vacuoles of atg11⌬ atg19⌬ cells as efﬁciently
as wild-type or either single mutant strains (figure 1d).
these two assay results indicated normal autophagy activity
for the atg11⌬ atg19⌬ double knockout strain. expression of
full-length atg19 complemented the atg19 defect of atg11⌬
atg19⌬ cells and reversed their prape1 import defect after
starvation treatment (figure 1e). atg19⌬10c also supported
the reversal phenotype in the atg19⌬ background as ex-
pected. the atg11⌬ atg19⌬ cells expressing atg19⌬10c did
not generate any mape1, in agreement with our proposal of
the dual interaction sorting mechanism. to our knowledge,
these results were the ﬁrst to clearly demonstrate the func-
tion of atg8, a cvt and autophagosomal vesicle membrane
component, in facilitating transport cargo selection.
atg19 facilitates targeting prape1 to the pas
by interaction with atg11 and atg8
targeting the prape1-atg19 complex to the vesicle forma-
tion pas is a prerequisite for its vacuolar delivery. despite
studies showing that this event is regulated by atg11,
mape1 is still generated in starved atg11⌬ cells, which indi-
cates that partial targeting of prape1 to the autophagosome
formation site in the absence of atg11 is possible. we next
studied the phenotypes of prape1 pas targeting to evaluate
our proposal of the dual interaction sorting mechanism. a
plasmid expressing prape1 with green ﬂuorescent protein
(gfp) tagged to its amino terminus was prepared and the
vacuolar delivery of this gfp-ape1 was conﬁrmed in wild-
type cells, suggesting its normal distribution as other re-
searchers observed (supplementary figure 1). the plasmid
was introduced to different mutant strains to mark their
prape1 cargo complex. the vacuole membrane in those cells
was labeled with the lipophilic dye fm 4-64. because the
pas site is close to the vacuole, overlapping of gfp and fm
4-64 ﬂuorescence signals was proposed as an indication of
proper prape1 pas targeting. the majority of atg1⌬ cells
showed efﬁcient targeting of prape1 to the pas in either
growing or starvation conditions, whereas separated gfp
and fm 4-64 signals were detected in a signiﬁcant percent-
age of a population of atg19⌬ cells, in agreement with its
receptor function for prape1 transport (figure 2, a and b).
for a population of growing atg11⌬ cells, the percentage of
cells with a targeting error was about the same as that of the
atg19⌬ strain. starvation treatment of atg11⌬ cells, however,
decreased the severity of this defect. counting the number
of cells with nonoverlapping gfp and fm 4-64 signals indi-
cated that the reversal phenotype was statistically signiﬁcant
(figure 2b). the sorting defect in an atg8⌬ background was
less severe than in atg11⌬ cells, and starvation stress signif-
icantly decreased the cells with separated signals. in accord
with our proposal, when both the atg8 and atg11 branches
of the prape1 sorting pathway were blocked, the percentage
of atg8⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout cells with a sorting error
was found to be similar to an atg19⌬ strain, and starvation
stress did not decrease the sorting error (figure 2b).
delivery of the prape1-atg19 cargo to the pas is pro-
posed as an induction signal to stimulate cvt vesicle forma-
tion, but how this induction is achieved is still unknown.
because atg11 regulates pas targeting of prape1-atg19 and
interacts with several atg proteins, it is a good candidate to
elicit and relay a cargo-loading signal and induce vesicle
formation (yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005a). to mediate these
functions, a partner protein localized at the pas was proposed
to interact with this incoming prape1-atg19-atg11 complex.
we have found an interaction between atg11 and atg9 (see the
next section), and proposed that atg9 served as the counterpart
to interact with atg11 at the pas. the prape1 targeting
defect in atg9⌬ cells was hence examined. although this
strain did not cause as severe a defect as seen with the atg11
mutation, cells with both atg9 and atg11 mutations (atg9⌬
atg11⌬) still lessened the prape1-sorting error after starva-
tion treatment (figure 2, a and b), in agreement with the
idea that they are in the same branch of atg19-atg11 medi-
ated prape1 sorting.
atg9 physically interacts with atg11
despite the fact that starvation-induced atg8 contributes to
prape1 sorting, the defect in atg8⌬ cells was much weaker
than that seen in atg19⌬ and atg11⌬ strains (figure 2, a and
b), indicating the critical role of atg11 in this process. we
next sought to identify the atg11 interaction partner at the
pas to evaluate its involvement in targeting the prape1-
atg19-atg11 complex. because atg9 is an integral mem-
brane protein and its shuttling to the pas requires the
presence of properly targeted prape1, we considered it a
good candidate to accept or relay cargo-loading signals at
the pas (noda et al., 2000; shintani and klionsky, 2004). to
test its possible interaction with atg11, we applied human
igg–coated magnetic beads to afﬁnity purify bacterial pro-
tein a fragment–tagged atg9 fusion proteins (prota-atg9)
from atg1⌬ cells. proteins associated with the pas were
subjected to immunoblotting analyses with antisera against
autophagy regulatory proteins. atg11 was indeed found
coisolated with prota-atg9 (figure 3, b and d). the inter-
action between atg9 and atg11 is likely to be direct because
atg11 was seen in the pulldown sample from detergent
triton x-100–treated protein extract, whereas prape1 and
several other atg proteins were not (data not shown). these
results exclude the possibility of indirect coisolation of
atg11 with the atg9-localized pas as a whole entity. previ-

atg17, and atg20 (yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005a). atg9 is
also known to interact with atg2 and atg18 (wang et al.,
2001; reggiori et al., 2004). we have conﬁrmed that the
coisolation of atg11 with prota-atg9 is not affected by
deletion of atg2, atg17, atg18 , oratg20 (supplementary figure
2). our pulldown experimental results identiﬁed another
unreported atg11 interaction partner, atg9.
to map the atg11 domain required for interaction with
atg9, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid analysis. atg11
fused with the gal4 dna binding domain (bd-atg11) and
gal4 activation domain fused atg9 (ad-atg9) recapitulated
the speciﬁc interaction in an atg11⌬ two-hybrid test strain
despite the fact that atg9 is a membrane protein with mul-
tiple transmembrane domains (figure 3, a and c). the
atg11⌬ background was chosen for this study to prevent any
possible interference caused by endogenous full-length
atg11. to further characterize the atg11 domain responsible
for this interaction, several truncated variants of atg11 were
prepared (figure 3a). the constructs were conﬁrmed to
express the desired atg11 variants by an immunoblotting
analysis probed with antiserum against the gal4 bd domain
(data not shown). the amino terminal half of atg11 (bd-
atg11⌬cc3-4) retained the ability to interact with ad-atg9,
but the carboxy terminus of atg11 (bd-atg11⌬cc1-3) did
not support cell growth on a test plate without histidine
(figure 3 a). our construct of the atg11 amino terminus
contained the ﬁrst and second cc domains (cc1 and cc2).
deletion of either one of them (bd-atg11⌬cc1 and bd-
atg11⌬cc2) inhibited cell growth on a test plate, indicating
that both the cc1 and cc2 of atg11 are required for inter-
action with atg9.
the two-hybrid results were further conﬁrmed by afﬁnity
pulldown experiments. prota-atg9 was coexpressed with
amino terminus myc-tagged full-length or truncated atg11
proteins by introducing corresponding low-copy plasmids
to atg1⌬ cells. cell extracts were subjected to afﬁnity purify
prota-atg9 together with its associated proteins. consistent
with the two-hybrid results, both full-length and the amino
terminus of myc-tagged atg11 were coisolated with prota-
atg9, whereas truncation of either the cc1 or cc2 domain
compromised atg11 and atg9 interaction (figure 3b).
the atg9 protein is predicted to have six to eight central-
located membrane-spanning segments with large hydro-
philic domains at both termini (noda et al., 2000). we have
constructed a series of truncated atg9 plasmids for a two-
hybrid assay to identify the atg11-interacting domain (fig-
ure 3c). all the constructs supported more or less similar
expression levels of the corresponding ad-atg9 variants
(data not shown). deletion of 200 residues from the carboxy
terminus (ad-atg9⌬200c) did not affect its interaction with
bd-atg11 (figure 3c). neither did 152 residues removed
from the atg9 amino terminus (ad-atg9⌬152n) inhibit
atg9-atg11 interaction. further removing an additional 49

residues from the amino terminus (ad-atg9⌬201n), how-
ever, blocked interaction. a plasmid expressing ad-atg9
with residues 154-201 truncated (ad-atg9⌬154-201) also
prevented cell growth on a test plate, suggesting that this
fragment is critical for recognition with atg11.
the conclusion drawn from the two-hybrid assay was then
conﬁrmed by afﬁnity puriﬁcation experiments. low-copy plas-
mids that express protein a fragment–tagged full-length or
truncated atg9 proteins were individually introduced into
atg1⌬ cells for evaluating their interaction with myc-atg11. all
of the prota-atg9 proteins were ﬁrst demonstrated to be efﬁ-
ciently isolated by human igg-coated magnetic beads (figure
3d). unexpectedly, prota-atg9⌬154n and -atg9⌬201n vari-
ants were found migrating faster than prota-atg9⌬200c in
a gel, which seemed to not correlate with the number of
residues deleted in the corresponding variants. to ensure
that the plasmids drive the expression of the desired atg9
proteins, their atg9 coding regions were conﬁrmed by se-
quencing. we suspected that this unusual mobility associ-
ated with different atg9 variants was due to different amino

atg9) and the atg9 variant with 200 residues truncated from
the carboxy terminus (prota-atg9⌬200c) efﬁciently coiso-
lated myc-atg11 (figure 3d). atg9 with residues 154-201
truncated (prota-atg9⌬154-201) lost the ability to coprecipi-
tate myc-atg11, which was in agreement with the two-
hybrid results indicating the involvement of this region for
interaction with atg11. however, deletion of 152 residues
from the amino terminus of atg9 (prota-atg9⌬152n) also
strongly obstructed coisolation of myc-atg11, which was
contradictory to the two-hybrid data. this inconsistency
may result from different stringency inherent in the two
assays.
deletion of the cc1 and cc2 of atg11 affects the
vacuolar transport of prape1
mapping of the binding domains has identiﬁed the require-
ment of atg11 cc1 and cc2 for interaction with atg9. we
rationalized that atg9 could function as a partner at the pas
to relay a cargo-loading signal and regulate subsequent
vesicle formation. if our hypothesis is correct, preventing the
atg9-atg11 interaction should also inhibit prape1 transport
by the cvt pathway, and starvation could reverse the defect
due to the atg19-atg8 interaction. an immunoblotting analy-
sis against ape1 showed that this was indeed the case (figure
4a). expression of atg11⌬cc1 or atg11⌬cc2 in atg11⌬ cells
did not rescue the prape1 import defect in growing conditions,
but starvation treatment generated mape1 in these cells, which
was also seen in control atg11⌬ cells with an empty plasmid.
furthermore, we examined prape1-sorting phenotypes for
cells expressing these two atg11 variants. in populations of
atg11⌬cc1- and atg11⌬cc2-expressing cells, a signiﬁcant
percentage of cells had gfp-ape1 separated from fm 4-64–
labeled vacuoles (figure 4b).
next, we also examined the cvt and autophagy functions
of cells expressing atg9⌬154-201, a truncated atg9 that lost
interaction with atg11. transport efﬁciency for prape1 was
ﬁrst evaluated. as reported before, atg9⌬ cells were not able
to deliver prape1 regardless of the nutrient conditions
(figure 5a). introducing a plasmid to express full-length
atg9 complemented this defect. interestingly, expressing
atg9⌬154-201 did not support prape1 transport in nutrient-
rich growing cells but starvation stress reversed this trans-
port defect, which is a phenotype similar to atg11⌬ cells
(figures 1a and 5a). this result again suggests that a proper
atg9-atg11 interaction is critical for the cvt pathway regu-
lation. next, the autophagy activity induced by short-term
starvation was evaluated by the pho8⌬60 alkaline phospha-
tase assay. atg9⌬154-201 supported delivery of cytosolically
accumulated pho8⌬60 to, and subsequent activation in, the
vacuoles to a level of ⬃75% of that seen with full-length
atg9 (figure 5b). a survival curve assay was then con-
ducted to test the viability of cells expressing atg9⌬154-201
in nitrogen starvation medium. cells of an atg9⌬ strain died
withi n 7 d ofstarvation treatment (figure 5c). expression of
full-length atg9 complemented the atg9⌬ phenotype and
maintained cell viability similar to the wild-type cell level.
atg9⌬154-201–expressing cells survived a long duration of
starvation stress but eventually died at the end of the assay
period of more than 2 wk. taken together, atg9⌬154-201
seems to completely block the cvt pathway but only mildly
affects autophagy regulation. finally, in addition to facilitate
prape1 transport via the cvt pathway, atg11 is also re-
quired for efﬁcient elimination of superﬂuous peroxisomes
during pexophagy (hutchins et al., 1999). we tested if
atg9⌬154-201 also inhibited pexophagy due to its defect in
interacting with atg11. after switching lipid-grown cells to

atg11.

distribution pattern is not observed in several autophagy
mutant strains, including atg1 and atg2 . inatg1⌬ cells, the
majority of gfp-atg9 was restricted at the pas in either
exponentially growing or starved cells (figure 6a). in grow-
ing cells, this pas-restricted atg9 is likely stuck in the
process of regulating cvt vesicle formation in order to de-
liver prape1 to the vacuole. therefore, in the absence of
prape1 cargo, gfp-atg9 restriction did not occur and a
diffuse ﬂuorescence signal pattern was detected in growing
atg1⌬ ape1⌬ double knockout cells (shintani and klionsky,
2004; figure 6a). starvation treatment caused gfp-atg9 to
be restricted in these cells, which was likely due to the
induction of autophagosome formation. interestingly, most
cells in this condition showed more than one gfp-atg9 dot.
in atg1⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout cells, gfp-atg9 showed
yet another distribution pattern. dispersed gfp-atg9 sig-
nals in the cytosol were detected in most cells regardless of
the nutrient conditions, although starvation seemed to have
the tendency to concentrate gfp-atg9 signals in this genetic
background. taken together, these distinctive gfp-atg9 sig-
nal patterns observed in different strains clearly indicate that
rather than merely facilitating transit of the prape1-atg19
complex to the pas, atg11 also affect the appearance of the
pas.

to ﬁnd out if this role of atg11 also relies on its direct
interaction with atg9, we examined gfp-atg9⌬154-201 ﬂu-
orescence signals. unlike full-length gfp-atg9, gfp-
atg9⌬154-201 was dispersed in the cytosol in growing atg1⌬
cells (figure 6b), which is consistent with its defect in the
regulation of cvt vesicle formation through interaction with
atg11. starvation treatment restricted gfp-atg9⌬154-201 to
a single pas in most atg1⌬ cells, a pattern shared with
gfp-atg9. interestingly, gfp-atg9⌬154-201 behaved ex-
actly the same as gfp-atg9 in both growing and starved
atg1⌬ ape1⌬ cells (figure 6, a and b). these results indicate
that atg9⌬154-201 retains the ability to cooperate with
atg11 to control the appearance of a single or multiple
autophagosome assembly pas sites depending on the pres-
ence of prape1 or not, and the cooperation does not require
direct atg11-atg9 interaction.
the multiple gfp-atg9 dots induced by starvation treat-
ment of atg1⌬ ape1⌬ double knockout cells might represent
nucleated sites of autophagosome assembly. because the
926
molecular biology of the cell
pas is usually found close to the vacuole in wild-type and
atg1⌬ strains, we examined whether those multiple gfp-
atg9 dots in double knockout cells also associated with the
vacuole. no matter whether or not prape1 was present,
gfp-atg9 signals were found colocalized with fm 4-64–
labeled vacuoles in starved cells of the atg1⌬ genetic back-
ground (figure 7a). next, a functional pas recruits many
atg proteins to regulate vesicle formation, and we applied
this as a criterion to evaluate the gfp-atg9 dots as sites of
autophagosome formation. to colocalize atg9 with other
atg proteins, a functional rfp-atg9 was prepared and its
ability to complement atg9⌬ defects was conﬁrmed (data not
shown). like gfp-atg9, rfp-atg9 was also restricted to
multiple dots in starved atg1⌬ ape1⌬ cells and these dots
colocalized with gfp-tagged atg8 (figure 7b), a marker of
autophagosomes, and atg5 (figure 7c), a component of
the autophagy-speciﬁc ubiquitin-like conjugation system
(mizushima et al., 1998; kirisako et al., 1999; huang et al.,
2000). furthermore, because gfp-atg9 did not form clear
puncta in the absence of a functional atg11 (figures 4c and
6b), we rationalized that the appearance of those atg9-
positive multiple pas sites require the function of atg11. as
a consequence, atg11 should also associate with atg9 dots.
our colocalization data showed that this was indeed the case
(figure 7d). finally, atg11 facilitates not only targeting of the
prape1-atg19 complex to the pas but also selective peroxi-
some degradation by pexophagy, which prompted us to spec-
ulate that the atg9 dots formed in the absence of prape1 were
stimulated by an atg11-dependent selective autophagic cargo.
we have tried to colocalize these gfp-atg9 dots with several
ﬂuorescent marker–labeled organelles, including peroxisomes,
mitochondria, and endosomes, but none of them were found to
colocalize (supplementary figure 3 and data not shown).
whether these multiple gfp-atg9 dots are assembling around
particulate selective autophagic cargo, equivalent
to the
prape1-formed cvt complex, remains to be tested.
discussion
right after being synthesized by cytosolic free ribosomes,
prape1 assembles into a particulate cvt complex and trig-
gers the cvt pathway to mediate its own efﬁcient import into
the vacuole in growing yeast cells. when cells experience
starvation stress, the now highly induced prape1 is deliv-
ered together with nonspeciﬁc cytosolic components by au-
tophagosomes. compared with the nonspeciﬁc autophagy
transport maker pho8⌬60, however, prape1 delivery by
either pathway is much more efﬁcient indicating the pres-
ence of a prape1 sorting mechanism.
the early event of prape1 sorting involves the atg11-
mediated targeting of
the prape1-atg19 cargo-receptor
complex to the vesicle formation pas. atg8, through its
covalent
linkage to the vesicle membrane, assists the
subsequent incorporation of prape1 into transport vesicles
(huang et al., 2000). by means of direct interaction between
atg19 and atg8, the prape1-atg19 complex may actually
facilitate vesicle assembly by serving as a scaffold. in accor-
dance with this current understanding, targeting prape1 to
the pas is largely unaffected but further transportation is
blocked due to the impairment of vesicle formation in atg8⌬
cells (kirisako et al., 1999; huang et al., 2000). it is known that
starvation stress induces atg8⌬ cells to generate small
and/or aberrant vesicles, which could account for the ability
of this strain to reverse its prape1 import defect (abeliovich
et al., 2000). however, what seems to be incompatible with
this working model of the prape1 sorting mechanism is that
starvation only induces maturation of prape1 in atg11⌬ but
cargo sorting in selective autophagy
not atg19⌬ strains, whereas a direct interaction between atg11
and atg19 was proposed as a crucial step for linking the
prape1 cargo to the vesicle-forming machinery (yorimitsu and
klionsky, 2005a). therefore, we suspected that atg19 achieved
its prape1 sorting functions via independent, instead of se-
quential, interactions with atg11 and atg8.
here we found that a strain with both atg8 and atg11
mutations lost the starvation-induced prape1 maturation
phenotype. autophagy was conﬁrmed to be induced to
full-strength by starvation in atg11⌬ atg19⌬ double knockout
cells, but expression of atg19⌬10c, which could not interact
with atg8, did not restore the ability to deliver prape1
under starvation conditions in this strain (figure 1). there-
fore, we concluded that atg19 might mediate a dual inter-
action mechanism to support prape1 sorting, one by inter-
action with atg11 and the other with atg8. quantifying the
percentage of cells with a severe prape1 sorting defect
seemed to support this proposal (figure 2). starvation de-
creased the percentage of cells with separated gfp-ape1
and fm 4-64 ﬂuorescence signals in atg8⌬ and atg11⌬
strains, consistent with their abilities to reverse prape1 im-
port defect. in an atg8⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout strain,
starvation did not diminish the sorting defect, and the num-
ber of cells with separated ﬂuorescence signals also reached
the level shown in atg19⌬ strain, again in agreement with
our proposal.
however, regardless of the sorting function contributed
by atg8, atg11 indeed plays an essential role to target the
prape1 cargo. in addition to atg19, previous studies have
identiﬁed multiple interacting partners of atg11, but none of
these proteins were conﬁrmed responsible for targeting the
whole prape1-atg19-atg11 complex to the pas (kim et al.,
2001b; yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005a). here we reported a
previously unidentiﬁed interaction between atg11 and atg9
(figure 3), and their proper interaction was required for not
only prape1 import by the cvt pathway but also normal
patterns of atg9 subcellular distribution (figures 4-6). inter-
estingly, pas-targeting of gfp-ape1 was affected by
inhibiting the atg11 and atg9 interaction (figures 2 and 4).
in the atg9⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout strain, the gfp-ape1
targeting defect was partially relieved by starvation, which
suggests that mutations in atg11 and atg9 affect the same
prape1 sorting event. taken together, these results seem to
indicate that atg9 plays an important role for targeting
prape1 cargo to the vesicle-forming pas by interaction with
atg11. however, the gfp-ape1 targeting defect in the atg9⌬
strain was not as severe as in the atg11⌬ strain (figure 2).
besides, atg9 is known to cycle between mitochondria and
the pas (reggiori et al., 2005; reggiori and klionsky, 2006).
it is necessary to distinguish the two populations of atg9 in
order to correctly target prape1 cargo to the pas. therefore,
we suspect that additional components participate in regu-
lation of the atg11-mediated targeting process, and atg9 is
responsible for relaying cargo-loading signals to induce ves-
icle assembly. this postulate is also consistent with our
observation that localization of gfp-atg11 to the perivacu-
olar pas is not signiﬁcantly affected in atg9⌬ cells (supple-
mentary figure 4). it is worth noting that, unlike a previous
report, we have found cells expressing atg11⌬cc1 defective
in prape1 transport (yorimitsu and klionsky, 2005a). the
reason for this inconsistency is not clear, but our atg11⌬
cc1 construct has four more residues deleted from the cc1
region (⌬ 272-325 of atg11) than the one used in earlier
studies (⌬ 272-321 of atg11). it remains to be conﬁrmed
whether this accounts for the different observation.
as atg9 fulﬁlls its function in regulation of vesicle forma-
tion at the pas, it is retrieved and returned to peripheral

mitochondria surface by the actions of several autophagy
regulatory proteins,
including the atg1-atg13 complex
(reggiori et al., 2004). hence, atg9 is restricted at the pas in
atg1⌬ cells, and studies of the distribution pattern of atg9 in
this genetic background have led to the conclusion that
cargo proteins facilitate vesicle formation at least in vegeta-
tive growth conditions (shintani and klionsky, 2004). in-
spired by these results, we examined the ﬂuorescence sig-
nals of gfp-tagged atg9⌬154-201, an atg9 variant unable to
interact with atg11, in several mutant strains and found
interesting results (figure 6). first, gfp-atg9⌬154-201 was
not restricted to the pas in growing atg1⌬ cells, a result
supporting the idea that a proper interaction between atg11
and atg9 is critical for the cvt pathway regulation. second,
starvation induced restriction of gfp-atg9⌬154-201 to a sin-
gle pas, whereas both gfp-atg9 and gfp-atg9⌬154-201
did not restrict to a major structure in the absence of atg11.
because atg9⌬154-201 cannot directly interact with atg11
and yet its restriction is under atg11 control, we propose
that other than targeting cargo proteins, atg11 also affects
pas function and that does not rely on its direct interaction
with atg9. this conclusion is in agreement with the data that
atg11⌬cc1 or atg11⌬cc2 did not restore the gfp-atg9
restriction phenomenon in atg1⌬ atg11⌬ double knockout
cells (figure 4). finally, in the absence of prape1, starvation
treatment induced the recruitment of the vesicle-forming
machinery to several perivacuolar dots under the control of
atg11 (figures 6 and 7). because atg11 also regulates other
speciﬁc cargo sorting for transportation by autophagosomes,
such as peroxisome degradation, we postulate whether un-
identiﬁed speciﬁc cargo are nucleating vesicle formation in
this situation (hutchins et al., 1999). our efforts to colocalize
these dots with organelle markers were failed, and this
hypothesis remains to be examined. alternatively, the pas
may become unstable and tend to break off without prape1
as a concrete cargo, which would also show this pas signal
pattern. whatever the reason is, these atg9 puncta are
clearly separated from mitochondria indicating their in-
volvement in regulation of vesicle formation (supplemen-
tary figure 3).
although the vesicle formation mechanism for the cvt
pathway and autophagy is quite distinctive from those for
trafﬁcking between the endomembrane system, efﬁcient
cargo sorting is equally important to all events (reggiori and
klionsky, 2005). it is not unprecedented to ﬁnd cargo-sorting
machineries with components generating multiple interac-
tions. taking the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (escrts) for example, all the three complexes
contain multiple ubiquitin-binding motifs, which may com-
pensate for the low afﬁnity between each motif and ubiq-
uitin, and facilitate subsequent cargo delivery at the endo-
somes (hurley and emr, 2006; slagsvold et al., 2006). in the
case of prape1 sorting, its assembly into a cvt complex,
association with atg19 and atg11, and atg11 oligomeriza-
tion eventually lead to a huge structure with multiple sites
to interact with downstream sorting components, atg8 and
possibly atg9. maybe only with these multiple interactions
it becomes possible to load such a huge protein inclusion
into a forming cvt vesicle or autophagosome. excitingly,
recent studies in mammalian systems have provided parallel
comparisons. the polyubiquitin-binding protein p62 was
found forming aggregates, associating with lc3, the mam-
malian homolog of yeast atg8, and facilitating mutant hun-
tingtin degradation by autophagosomes (kabeya et al., 2000;
bjorkoy et al., 2005). these data provide striking similarity
between prape1 sorting and p62-mediated huntingtin ag-
gregates elimination. it will be interesting to test if an atg11-
equivalent component links huntingtin-p62 complex to the
mammalian autophagy machinery, say matg9, in the future.
