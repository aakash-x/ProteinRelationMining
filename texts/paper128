inhibition of
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) plays a
central role in regulating the proliferation of malignant
glioma cells, and mtor-speciﬁc inhibitors
such as
rapamycin analogs are considered as promising therapy
for malignant gliomas. however, the efﬁcacy of mtor
inhibitors alone in the treatment of patients with malignant
gliomas is only modest, potentially because these agents
rather than acting as mtor kinase inhibitors instead
interfere with the function of only mtor/raptor (regula-
tory-associated protein of mtor) complex and thus do not
perturb all mtor functions. the purpose of this study was
to determine whether global
the mtor
molecule enhances the antitumor effect of rapamycin on
malignant glioma cells. we showed that rapamycin induced
autophagy and that
inhibition of autophagy by small
interfering rna (sirna) directed against autophagy-
related gene beclin 1 attenuated the cytotoxicity of
rapamycin in rapamycin-sensitive tumor cells,
indicating
that the autophagy was a primary mediator of rapamycin’s
antitumor
response.
exogenous expression of an mtor mutant interfering
with its kinase activity markedly enhanced the incidence
of
silencing
of mtor with sirna augmented the inhibitory effect of
rapamycin on tumor cell viability by stimulating autophagy.
importantly, not only rapamycin-sensitive malignant glioma
cells with pten mutations but also rapamycin-resistant
malignant glioma cells with wild-type pten were sensitized
to rapamycin by mtor sirna. these results indicate that
rapamycin-induced autophagy is one of the agent’s anti-
tumor effects and that silencing or inhibiting mtor kinase
activity could enhance the effectiveness of rapamycin.

introduction
it
malignant gliomas are among the most devastating
cancers (surawicz et al., 1998). because these tumors
rapidly grow and invade the surrounding brain paren-
chyma,
is often impossible to achieve complete
surgical resection without causing severe neurologic
damage. malignant gliomas have a dismal prognosis:
the median overall survival duration of patients after
diagnosis is 12–15 months despite the multidisciplinary
use of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (mitchell
et al., 2005). novel therapeutic agents for malignant
gliomas are sorely needed.
the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (pi3k)/
protein kinase b (akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mtor) signaling pathway is crucial for cell prolifera-
tion, survival and migration (vogt, 2001; oldham and
hafen, 2003). dysregulation of this pathway occurs in
various cancers (sekulic et al., 2000; vogt, 2001), and
inhibition of pi3k/akt/mtor signaling is considered
an attractive strategy for
treating diverse cancers
(vivanco and sawyers, 2002). in particular, mtor is
regarded as an essential molecule in maintaining the
transformed phenotype and therefore in regulating the
sensitivity of cancer cells to mtor inhibitors (bjornsti
and houghton, 2004). rapamycin and its derivatives,
such as cci-779, rad001 and ap23573, speciﬁcally
bind to the intracellular fkbp12 protein to form a
drug–receptor complex that then interacts with and
suppresses mtor,
its
downstream molecule p70s6 kinase (p70s6k) (huang
and houghton, 2003; sawyers, 2003). accumulating
results from phase i and ii trials suggest that the
inhibition of mtor signaling could be exploited as
therapy (peralba et al., 2003).
a cancer-speciﬁc
however, these agents alone were only mildly effective
in patients with malignant gliomas, and only 36% of
the patients showed improvement on neuroimaging
(galanis et al., 2005). the resistance to mtor
inhibitors underscores the need to explore a novel
means of sensitizing this disease to treatment with
mtor inhibitors.

moreover,
inhibit all mtor
functions, because mtor exists in cells at least two
distinct multiprotein complexes and only one of which
binds to fkbp12–rapamycin (loewith et al., 2002). the
rapamycin-sensitive complex is deﬁned by the inter-
action of mtor with the accessory protein raptor
(regulatory-associated protein of mtor), and the
rapamycin-insensitive complex interacts with rictor
(rapamycin-insensitive companion of mtor) (guertin
and sabatini, 2005). on the basis of these observations,
we speculated that global
inhibition of the mtor
molecule would enhance the cytotoxic effect of rapa-
mycin. to test our hypothesis, we treated rapamycin-
sensitive and rapamycin-resistant malignant glioma cells
with small interfering rna (sirna) directed against
mtor in the presence of rapamycin. silencing of
mtor augmented the effect of rapamycin in tumor
cells regardless of
intrinsic sensitivity to
rapamycin. enhancement of rapamycin-induced auto-
phagy or type ii programmed cell death appears to be
the critical mediator. our ﬁndings suggest that silencing
mtor signaling can sensitize malignant glioma cells to
rapamycin.

effect of rapamycin on the cell viability of malignant
glioma cells with mutant or wild-type pten
accumulating evidence indicates that rapamycin is
particularly effective against tumors with constitutively
activation of the pi3k pathway such as that occurs with
mutational inactivation of pten (guertin and sabatini,
2005). therefore, we used four established malignant
glioma cell lines, three with mutant pten (u87-mg,
a172 and d54) and one with wild-type pten (ln229),
to examine the antitumor effect of rapamycin. to assess
the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, all four cell lines were
treated with 1, 10 and 100 nm rapamycin for 48 h or with
100 nm rapamycin for 24 or 48 h and then subjected to
the wst-1 cell viability assay. as shown in figure 1a,
the cell viability of the lines with mutant pten was
moderately inhibited by rapamycin in dose- and time-
dependent manners, whereas ln229 cells were resistant
to rapamycin even at a high concentration of 100 nm for
48 h. thus, as we predicted, tumor cells with wild-type
pten were more resistant to rapamycin than were
tumor cells with mutant pten.
to investigate whether the variations in sensitivity
to rapamycin were due to rapamycin’s effect on
mtor signaling in tumor cells, we assessed the

found that rapamycin effectively inhibited the phos-

u87-mg cells and rapamycin-resistant ln229 cells
(figure 1b). in u87-mg cells, treatment with rapamycin

ln229 cells, treatment with rapamycin at 1 nm for 48 h
(bic95) almost completely suppressed p70s6k phos-
phorylation.
the phosphorylation of
4e-bp1 was not
inhibited by rapamycin treatment
(figure 1c). these results indicated that the antitumor
effect of rapamycin is modest even for malignant glioma
cells without pten function. further, the inhibitory

but not 4e-bp1 was apparent

interestingly,
induction of autophagy in malignant glioma cells
by rapamycin
autophagy is detected in a variety of cells treated with
rapamycin (noda and ohsumi, 1998; gutierrez et al.,
2004; kanazawa et al., 2004; ravikumar et al., 2004).
we used electron microscopic analysis to determine
whether rapamycin induces autophagy in our malignant
glioma cells. numerous autophagic vacuoles were
observed in u87-mg cells treated with 100 nm rapamy-
cin for 48 h, whereas u87-mg cells treated with vehicle
alone for 48 h exhibited few autophagic features
(figure 2a). there was no chromatin condensation or
fragmentation, which is characteristic of apoptosis, in
rapamycin-treated u87-mg cells.
we also assessed the presence of a punctate pattern of
the green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp)-tagged microtubule-
associated protein light chain 3 (lc3)
(gfp-lc3)
expression to determine whether rapamycin induces
autophagy in malignant glioma cells. u87-mg cells
were transiently transfected with gfp-lc3 expression
vector for 24 h and then treated with vehicle alone
or rapamycin (100 nm)
for an additional 48 h, as
described previously (kanzawa et al., 2005). under
a ﬂuorescence microscope, the vast majority of the

gfp-lc3-transfected cells showed diffuse distribution
of gfp-lc3 in the absence of rapamycin, whereas
treatment with rapamycin often resulted in a punctate
pattern of gfp-lc3 ﬂuorescence (figure 2b). this
pattern represents the presence of autophagic vacuoles
and indicated that lc3 is recruited to autophagic
vacuoles in u87-mg cells treated with rapamycin.
quantiﬁcation of autophagic cells
revealed that
compared with vehicle alone, treatment with rapamycin
signiﬁcantly increased the incidence of autophagy in
u87-mg cells (10 versus 32%), a172 cells (10 versus
30%), d54 cells (10 versus 26%) and ln229 cells
(7 versus 20%) (po0.01 for all cell lines) (figure 2c).
the prevalence of autophagy was lower in rapamycin-
treated ln229 cells than in other rapamycin-treated
cells. these results indicated that rapamycin induces
autophagy in malignant glioma cells and that the extent
of autophagy induction might be related to their
sensitivity to rapamycin.

effect of mtor sirna on rapamycin-induced autophagy
a iwamaru et al
2004; kondo et al., 2005). to assess the role of
autophagy in rapamycin cytotoxicity, we determined
whether inhibition of autophagy alters rapamycin-
induced cytotoxicity. u87-mg cells were transfected
with 100 nm non-targeting (random) sirna or beclin 1
sirna for 72 h in the presence of oligofectamine
and subjected to western blotting using anti-beclin 1
antibody. beclin 1 is a mammalian homologue of yeast
atg6, which is necessary for autophagy to proceed
in response to nutrient deprivation (liang et al., 1999).
we observed that transfection with beclin 1 sirna
markedly suppressed the expression of beclin 1 protein
relative to transfection with random sirna (figure 3a).
to determine the effect of beclin 1 sirna transfec-
tion on rapamycin-induced autophagy, u87-mg and
ln229 cells transiently transfected with the gfp-lc3
vector for 24 h were transfected with random sirna or
beclin 1 sirna for an additional 48 h. after that, the
transfected cells were treated with vehicle alone or
100 nm rapamycin for 48 h and observed with ﬂuore-
scence microscopy, and autophagic cells were quanti-
ﬁed. relative to the induction of autophagy by
rapamycin alone, the prevalence of autophagic cells
was signiﬁcantly reduced by beclin 1 sirna transfection
(32 versus 8% in u87-mg cells, po0.01; 19 versus 13%
in ln229 cells, po0.05), whereas transfection with
random sirna did not signiﬁcantly affect autophagy

determined whether the cytotoxic effect of rapamycin
was affected by beclin 1 sirna transfection. after
transfection with 100 nm random sirna or beclin 1
sirna for 48 h, u87-mg and ln229 cells were treated
with vehicle alone or rapamycin (10 or 100 nm) for
another 48 h for the cell viability assay. transfection
with beclin 1 sirna signiﬁcantly attenuated the
inhibitory effect of 100 nm rapamycin on the viability
of u87-mg cells relative to random sirna (83 versus
99%, po0.01) (figure 3c). however, beclin 1 sirna
transfection did not increase the incidence of apoptosis
in rapamycin-treated u87-mg cells (data not shown).
on the other hand, inhibition of autophagy by beclin 1
sirna did not affect the viability of ln229 cells treated
with rapamycin (figure 3c), suggesting that autophagy
might be not rather protective in ln229 cells. these
results indicated that rapamycin-induced autophagy
mediates the growth inhibitory activity of rapamycin in
rapamycin-sensitive tumor cells, suggesting that stimula-
tion of the autophagy caused by rapamycin should
correspond to augmentation of its antitumor effect.

figure 4a, although the phosphorylation of p70s6k was
suppressed to an undetectable level in u87-mg cells by
treatment with 100 nm rapamycin for 48 h, mtor
catalytic activity was not inhibited. a pi3k inhibitor
ly294002 (5 mm, 24 h), which we used as a negative
control (takeuchi et al., 2005), remarkably suppressed
the phosphorylation of p70s6k and the mtor catalytic
activity. these results suggested that the cellular effects
of rapamycin are not mediated through the suppression
of mtor kinase activity.

cells were transiently transfected with the expression

dominant-negative, or the au1-tagged mtor mutant
(mtor si), which has reduced binding afﬁnity for

and gfp-lc3 in the presence or absence of rapamycin.
as shown in figure 4b, transfection of u87-mg cells
with mtor sida or mtor si induced the expression
of au1 protein and increased the expression level of
mtor protein compared with parental u87-mg cells.
treatment with 100 nm rapamycin for 48 h, transfection
with 1 mg mtor sida for 72 h and their combination
induced some cells to become autophagic (data not

suggesting
that the effect of rapamycin on autophagy is solely

mtor kinase increased the effect of rapamycin on
induction of autophagy.

100 nm mtor sirna for 72 h compared with random
sirna. as we found for rapamycin treatment, there
was no chromatin condensation or
fragmentation
characteristic of apoptosis. we also assessed the
incidence of autophagic cells by using gfp-lc3
plasmid transfection. as shown in figure 5d, u87-mg
cells treated with oligofectamine alone or transfected
with 100 nm random sirna for 72 h showed diffuse
distribution of green ﬂuorescence, whereas transfection
with 100 nm mtor sirna for 72 h induced a punctate
pattern of gfp-lc3 expression. quantiﬁcation of
autophagic cells showed that compared with random
sirna, the prevalence of mtor sirna-transfected
autophagic cells increased in u87-mg cells (20 versus
50%), a172 cells (14 versus 48%), d54 cells (15 versus
46%) and ln229 cells (22 versus 48%) (po0.01 for all
cell lines) (figure 5e). these results indicated that the
inhibitory effect of mtor sirna on tumor cell viability
is through the induction of autophagy.
enhancement of the rapamycin-induced antitumor effect
on malignant glioma cells by mtor sirna
because mtor sirna induces autophagy in malignant
glioma cells, we speculated that mtor sirna might
enhance the antitumor effect of rapamycin by stimulat-
ing the autophagic pathway. to test our hypothesis, we
transfected malignant glioma cells with 100 nm mtor
sirna for 24 h and then treated them with vehicle alone
or with 100 nm rapamycin for 48 h for the wst-1 cell
viability assay. as shown in figure 6a, the cell viability
of u87, a172, d54 and ln229 cells was most inhibited
by the combination of rapamycin and mtor sirna,
and this combined effect was signiﬁcant compared with
rapamycin alone or mtor sirna alone (pp0.01 for
all comparisons).
we also assessed the enhancement of autophagy by
transfecting tumor cells with the gfp-lc3 expression
vector before treatment with 100 nm rapamycin or
transfection with 100 nm mtor sirna. quantiﬁcation
of autophagic cells revealed that relative to vehicle
alone, the combination therapy increased the prevalence
of autophagic cells to 64% in u87-mg cells, 70%
in a172 cells, 60% in d54 cells and 56% in ln229

a iwamaru et al
cells (figure 6b). transfection with mtor sirna
signiﬁcantly increased the incidence of
rapamycin-
induced autophagy compared with rapamycin alone or
mtor sirna alone (pp0.02 for all comparisons).
these results indicated that mtor sirna increases the
antitumor effects of rapamycin on not only rapamycin-
sensitive u87-mg, a172 and d54 cells but also
rapamycin-resistant ln229 cells by stimulating the
induction of autophagy.
to determine the role of autophagy in the loss of
cell survival caused by rapamycin and mtor sirna,
we inhibited the autophagy using beclin 1 sirna
as described above. as shown in figure 6c, beclin 1
sirna transfection inhibited the prevalence of auto-
phagic cells from 62 to 31% in u87-mg cells (po0.01).
furthermore, transfection with beclin 1 sirna signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the inhibitory effect of rapamycin and
mtor sirna on the viability of u87-mg cells
(po0.05). these results conﬁrmed that autophagy
plays a central role in the loss of cell viability in this
setting.
on the other hand, recent investigations showed that
mtor inhibition activates the upstream signaling such
as akt (shi et al., 2005; o’reilly et al., 2006). therefore,
we determined whether rapamycin or mtor sirna
stimulates the phosphorylation of akt in malignant
glioma cells. as shown in figure 6d treatment with
100 nm rapamycin for 48 h or 100 nm mtor sirna for
48 h did not affect the phosphorylation level of akt.
these results indicated that the upstream molecule of
the mtor was not inﬂuenced by rapamycin or mtor
sirna at least in u87-mg cells.
discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that rapamycin induced
autophagy in malignant glioma cells and that
this
autophagy mediated the growth inhibitory effect of
rapamycin. we also demonstrated that
rapamycin
treatment did not inhibit the mtor kinase activity
directly. indeed, the incidence of autophagy induced by
rapamycin was enhanced by suppression of the kinase

effect of mtor sirna on rapamycin-induced autophagy
a iwamaru et al
activity. furthermore, mtor sirna increased the
sensitivity of malignant glioma cells to rapamycin by
stimulating autophagy regardless of the pten status of
the tumor cells. these ﬁndings suggest that silencing the
mtor signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic
strategy with which to sensitize malignant glioma cells to
rapamycin. the mechanism for the additive activity of
rapamycin and mtor activity inhibition is not clear.
however,
it is likely that the inhibition of mtor
activity by the dominant-negative construct or sirna
was not complete and that rapamycin augmented the
effects on the raptor-sensitive events downstream of
mtor. inhibition of mtor likely initiated additional
process dependent on rapamycin-insensitive actions of
mtor such as rictor-dependent processes.
mtor acts as a molecular link between apoptosis
and autophagy (castedo et al., 2002). mtor inhibitors
induce apoptosis in some types of tumor cells (hosoi
et al., 1999; nepomuceno et al., 2003; majumder et al.,
2004; avellino et al., 2005), whereas they trigger
autophagy in other settings (noda and ohsumi, 1998;
gutierrez et al., 2004; kanazawa et al., 2004; ravikumar
et al., 2004) as well as in malignant glioma cells as
shown in this study and our previous investigation
(takeuchi et al., 2005). autophagy is a process by which
cells degrade and recycle proteins and intracellular
components in response to stress or starvation (klionsky
and emr, 2000; levine and klionsky, 2004; shintani
and klionsky, 2004). a complex of class iii pi3k and
beclin 1 at the trans-golgi network acts to induce
autophagy, whereas mtor, which is a downstream
target of the class i pi3k/akt,
inhibits autophagy.
however, the direct relationship between beclin 1 and
mtor is not yet deﬁned. tor kinase in yeast or mtor
in mammalian cells is considered a gatekeeper for the
initiation of the autophagic pathway. on the other
study, beclin 1 sirna transfection
hand,
inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy. these suggest
that mtor might be located upstream of beclin 1.
in this
in cancer research, autophagy is a novel concept, and
its therapeutic role remains unclear (ogier-denis and
codogno, 2003; gozuacik and kimchi, 2004; kondo
et al., 2005). in this study, we demonstrated that
inhibition of rapamycin-induced autophagy by beclin 1
sirna attenuated rapamycin’s cytotoxicity, indicating
that rapamycin-induced autophagy likely mediates, at
least in part, the antitumor effects of rapamycin. the
extent of autophagy caused by rapamycin was greater in
rapamycin-sensitive tumor cells than in rapamycin-
resistant tumor cells. moreover, silencing the mtor
signal by sirna enhanced rapamycin-induced auto-
phagy and concurrently increased rapamycin’s cytoto-
xicity. these ﬁndings
the degree of
autophagy induced by rapamycin is likely to correlate
with its therapeutic efﬁcacy. in general, tumor cells
require a higher level of protein synthesis than protein
degradation to grow rapidly (cuervo, 2004). indeed, less
autophagic degradation is seen in cancer cells than in
their normal counterparts. therefore, autophagy is
thought to be a tumor suppressor mechanism (ogier-
denis and codogno, 2003; gozuacik and kimchi, 2004;
suggest
that
oncogene
kondo et al., 2005) based on the ﬁndings that beclin 1 is
a haploinsufﬁcient tumor suppressor gene that regulates
autophagy (liang et al., 1999; qu et al., 2003; yue et al.,
2003). because beclin 1 sirna inhibited rapamycin-
induced autophagy and reduced its antitumor effect
but did not induce apoptosis in rapamycin-sensitive
tumor cells, we speculated that beclin 1 plays a role
in rapamycin-induced autophagy, which suppresses
growth of malignant glioma cells.
accumulating evidence indicates that pten-deﬁcient
tumor cells are more sensitive to rapamycin than are
tumor cells with wild-type pten because the loss of
pten activates a rapamycin-sensitive raptor-mtor
growth pathway (kim et al., 2002; guertin and sabatini,
2005)
to which these cells become dependent or
addicted. indeed, in our study, ln229 cells with wild-
type pten were resistant to rapamycin compared with
other malignant glioma cells with mutant pten.
strikingly, phosphorylation of p70s6k was equally
sensitive to rapamycin in each of the cell lines indicating
that
inhibition of phosphorylation of p70s6k is
insufﬁcient to explain the activity of rapamycin. the
mechanism by which rapamycin blocks the phospho-
rylation of p70s6k but not 4e-bp1 requires additional
investigation as rapamycin did not directly inhibit
mtor kinase activity, consistent with the results of
investigation (edinger et al., 2003).
another recent
furthermore, expression of kinase-inactive mtor
increased the effect of rapamycin on malignant glioma
cells in this study and on human embryonic kidney
hek 293 cells (edinger et al., 2003). these observations
suggested that rapamycin does not perturb all mtor
functions and therefore that inhibition of other mtor
functions, such as kinase activity, could require the
addition of anticancer agents other than rapamycin to
sensitize cells to rapamycin.
in contrast to raptor, rictor was recently identiﬁed in
both yeast and mammals as a novel mtor-interacting
protein (loewith et al., 2002). unlike its mtor–raptor
sibling, the mtor–rictor complex does not bind to
fkbp12–rapamycin and is insensitive to rapamycin.
this discovery provided solid evidence that rapamycin
does not completely inhibit mtor function. in addi-
tion, a recent investigation showed that the inhibition of
mtor by rapamycin triggered the activation of survival
signaling pathways, including the akt pathway, and that
this activation may contribute to drug resistance (sun
et al., 2005). this phenomenon provides support for the
idea that mtor has a positive role in regulating akt
phosphorylation that is not shared with raptor but
possibly is shared with rictor (guertin and sabatini,
2005). in this study, we succeeded in sensitizing not only
rapamycin-sensitive malignant glioma cells but also
rapamycin-resistant cells to rapamycin by using mtor
sirna. our success could be explained by the effects of
dominant-negative mtor and mtor silencing on
global
inhibition of two mtor complexes. in other
words, mtor sirna treatment could cause dysfunc-
tion of both raptor–mtor and rictor–mtor com-
plexes, whereas rapamycin treatment does not induce a
complete inhibition of mtor function. the ability of
rapamycin to increase the activity of dominant-negative
mtor or mtor sirna suggests that these approaches
do not completely block mtor function and that
rapamycin provides a more complete blockade. alter-
natively, rapamycin may mediate functions that are
independent of mtor that are additive with inhibition
of mtor.
in conclusion, we demonstrated that autophagy is
required for rapamycin to inhibit
the viability of
malignant glioma cells. the extent of autophagy
induction correlates with the effectiveness of rapamycin,
which is supported by a recent investigation showing the
negative regulatory effect of ras oncogene on auto-
phagy and its reversion by rapamycin that induces
autophagy in ras-transformed cells (furuta et al.,
2004). moreover, silencing the mtor signal by sirna
enhances rapamycin’s antitumor effect by increasing
the extent of autophagy. strikingly, in our study, this
combination regimen sensitizes even rapamycin-resis-
tant tumor cells. taken together, our results suggest that
therapy with both rapamycin and mtor sirna is a
promising strategy with which to manage malignant
gliomas.
materials and methods
reagent
rapamycin was obtained from sigma chemical (st louis,
mo, usa). the stock solution was made at a concentration of
1 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and stocked at  201c.
cell culture
human malignant glioma u87-mg and a172 cells with pten
mutation (adachi et al., 1999; morimoto et al., 1999) were
purchased from american type culture collection (manassas,
va, usa). human malignant glioma d54 cells with mutant
pten and ln229 cells with wild-type pten were kindly
supplied by dr frederick f lang and dr candelaria gomez-
manzano (the university of texas md anderson cancer
center, houston, tx, usa). cells were cultured in dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa), 4 mm glutamine,
100 u/ml penicillin and 2.5 mg/ml fungizone (invitrogen) at
371c in 5% co2.
cell viability assay
the cytotoxic effect of rapamycin was determined using a
wst-1 cell proliferation reagent kit (roche applied science,
indianapolis, in, usa), as described previously (ito et al.,
2005). tumor cells in the exponential growth phase were
harvested and seeded at 5 103 cells per 0.1-ml well in 96-well
ﬂat-bottomed plates (corning, corning, ny, usa) and
incubated overnight at 371c in 5% co2. after exposure to
rapamycin (1, 10 or 100 nm) for 24 or 48 h, the cells were
incubated with 10% wst-1 cell culture medium for 1 h, and
the absorbance of the samples against a background control
was measured using a microplate reader. the viability of
tumor cells treated with vehicle alone was regarded as 100%.
western blotting
soluble proteins were isolated from treated or untreated tumor
cells for western blotting as described previously (takeuchi
1849
effect of mtor sirna on rapamycin-induced autophagy
a iwamaru et al
et al., 2005). equal amounts of protein (20–40 mg) from each
sample were separated by electrophoresis through sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels (bio-rad, richmond,
ca, usa) and transferred to a hybond-p membrane
(amersham, piscataway, nj, usa). the membranes were
treated with antibodies and subjected to western blotting
using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ecl) or ecl-plus
chemiluminescence reagent (amersham). the primary anti-
body against b-actin was purchased from sigma, and the
antibodies against
total
p70s6k, phospho-p70s6k (thr389), 4e-bp1, phospho-4e-
bp1 (thr37/46) and mtor were purchased from cell signaling
technology (beverly, ma, usa). anti-beclin 1 antibody was
purchased from novus biologicals (littleton, co, usa).
anti-au1 antibody was purchased from covance (denver,
pa, usa).
total akt, phospho-akt
(ser473),
electron microscopy
tumor cells were grown on glass coverslips,
treated as
described above for the cell viability assay, and ﬁxed with a
solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformal-
dehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, ph 7.3, for 1 h. after
ﬁxation, the samples were post-ﬁxed in 1% oso4 in the same
buffer for 1 h, and then subjected to electron microscopic
analysis as described previously (takeuchi et al., 2005).
representative areas were chosen for ultrathin sectioning
and viewed with a jem 1010 transmission electron microscope
(jeol, peabody, ma, usa) at an accelerating voltage of
80 kv. digital images were obtained using the amt imaging
system (advanced microscopy techniques, danvers, ma,
usa).
assessment of the involvement of lc3
lc3, a mammalian homolog of atg8 in yeast, is recruited to
the autophagosome membrane during autophagy (kabeya
et al., 2000). gfp-lc3-expressing cells have been successfully
used to demonstrate induction of autophagy by amino-acid
deprivation or anticancer treatments (kabeya et al., 2000;
mizushima et al., 2001; kanzawa et al., 2005). gfp-lc3 cells
present a diffuse distribution under control conditions,
whereas a punctate pattern of gfp-lc3 expression (gfp-
lc3 dots) is induced by autophagy. in the current study, we
determined the prevalence of autophagic cells (i.e., cells
expressing gfp-lc3 dots) by using the gfp-lc3 expression
vector kindly provided by dr noboru mizushima (tokyo
metropolitan institute of medical science, tokyo, japan), as
described previously (daido et al., 2005; kanzawa et al., 2005).
tumor cells were transiently transfected with this vector by
using fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche). after overnight
culture, the cells were treated with vehicle alone, rapamycin or
sirna for 48–72 h, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope. to quantify
autophagic cells after treatment, we counted the number of
autophagic cells among 200 gfp-positive cells.
sirna transfection
for sirna transfection, cells at a concentration of 2.5 or
5 104 cells/ml were incubated for 24 h in six-well plates in
culture medium. the cells were then transfected with 100 nm
beclin 1, mtor or non-targeting (random) sirna (dharma-
con, lafayette, co, usa)
for 72 h in the presence of
oligofectamine (invitrogen) and subjected to western blotting
using anti-beclin 1 or anti-mtor antibody. the beclin 1
sirna sequence was 50-cagtttggcacaatcaata-30
(yu et al., 2004), and the mtor sirna sequence was
50-aagaaucaaagagcagagugc-30 (kim et al., 2002),

transfection, tumor cells transfected with 100 nm beclin 1,
mtor or random sirna for 24 h were treated with vehicle
alone or rapamycin (1–100 nm) for 48 h for the wst-1 assay
and the detection of gfp-lc3 dots.
activity assay of mtor
for mtor immunoprecipitation, tumor cells treated with
vehicle alone or rapamycin (100 nm) for 48 h or ly294002
(5 mm) for 24 h were solubilized in rippa lysis buffer (upstate,
waltham, ma, usa). then, 100 mg of extracted protein per
sample in 500 ml of lysis buffer was immunoprecipitated with
anti-mtor antibody and protein a beads as described
previously (zhang et al., 2003). samples were incubated with
[g-32p]atp (perkin elmer, boston, ma, usa), cold atp
(sigma) and 4e-bp-1 (calbiochem, san diego, ca, usa) in
kinase buffer for 30 min and then processed for sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. labeling
was visualized by autoradiography.
transient transfection with kinase-inactive mtor mutant vector
tumor cells were co-transfected with gfp-lc3 plasmid and
au1 epitope-tagged mtor mutant vectors (si and sida)
(edinger et al., 2003), which were kindly provided by
dr robert t abraham (wyeth research, pearl river, ny,
usa), by using fugene transfection reagent. twenty-four
hours later, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or
rapamycin (100 nm) for 48 h, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and were examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope.
statistical analysis
all experiments were repeated at least three times. the data are
expressed as means7standard deviations (s.d.s). statistical
analysis was performed using student’s t-test (two-tailed). the
criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was po0.05.
