autophagy is the unique, regulated mechanism for the degrada-
tion of organelles. this intracellular process acts as a prosurvival
pathway during cell starvation or stress and is also involved in
cellular response against speciﬁc bacterial infections. vibrio chol-
erae is a noninvasive intestinal pathogen that has been studied
extensively as the causative agent of the human disease cholera.
v. cholerae illness is produced primarily through the expression of
a potent toxin (cholera toxin) within the human intestine. besides
cholera toxin, this bacterium secretes a hemolytic exotoxin termed
v. cholerae cytolysin (vcc) that causes extensive vacuolation in
epithelial cells. in this work, we explored the relationship between
the vacuolation caused by vcc and the autophagic pathway.
treatment of cells with vcc increased the punctate distribution of
lc3, a feature indicative of autophagosome formation. moreover,
vcc-induced vacuoles colocalized with lc3 in several cell lines,
including human intestinal caco-2 cells, indicating the interaction
of the large vacuoles with autophagic vesicles. electron microscopy
analysis conﬁrmed that the vacuoles caused by vcc presented
hallmarks of autophagosomes. additionally, biochemical evidence
demonstrated the degradative nature of the vcc-generated vacu-
oles.
interestingly, autophagy inhibition resulted in decreased
survival of caco-2 cells upon vcc intoxication. also, vcc failed to
induce vacuolization in atg5ⴚ/ⴚ cells, and the survival response of
these cells against the toxin was dramatically impaired. these
results demonstrate that autophagy acts as a cellular defense
pathway against secreted bacterial toxins.

autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process that is acti-
vated in cells under conditions of stress, such as nutrient
deprivation and growth factors (1, 2). it has been hypothesized
that this degradative pathway evolved as a response to starvation
and is the main component in the turnover of long-lived proteins
in eukaryotic cells. in the last few years, this pathway has been
associated with an increasing number of important functions
(3–6). when autophagy is induced, isolation membranes seques-
ter portions of cytosol, including organelles, and form a double-
membrane structure called an ‘‘autophagosome’’ (7, 8). auto-
phagosomes mature by fusing with various endocytic
compartments to ultimately degrade their content.
in recent years, the molecular machinery that regulates autoph-
agy has begun to be revealed (9). in yeast, it has been shown that
two ubiquitylation-like conjugation systems are required for auto-
phagosome formation (10). the first conjugation system is the
atg5–atg12 complex. the atg5-atg12 conjugate is essential for
elongation of the isolation membrane (11). map-lc3 is a mam-
malian homologue of atg8 in yeast and is part of the second
conjugation system that leads to the covalent linkage between lc3
and phosphatidylethanolamine (12). it has been shown that lc3
exists in two forms: the cytosolic form (lc3-i) and the processed
form (lc3-ii) located on the autophagosomal membrane. lc3
processing is activated when autophagy is induced (12).
vibrio cholerae is a noninvasive pathogen that produces cholera,
a disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, which is po-
tentially highly lethal and occurs as epidemics or even pandemics
that mainly affect developing countries (13, 14). a potent entero-
toxin, termed cholera toxin (ct), and a colonization factor, termed
toxin coregulated pilus (tcp), are critically involved in the patho-
genesis of cholera (14, 15). besides ct and tcp, v. cholerae
generates several additional secreted proteins that possess well
characterized cytotoxic activity in vitro (16, 17). v. cholerae cytolysin
(vcc) is an exotoxin produced by most o1 biotype el tor and
non-o1/non-o139 v. cholerae isolates (18, 19) encoded by the hlya
gene (20). this cytotoxic factor is a pore-forming toxin that causes
vacuolization or cell lysis and necrosis, depending on the cell type
and toxin concentration (21–25). it has been proposed that vcc
contributes to the pathogenesis of gastroenteritis, particularly in
strains that do not produce ct (26). a potent cell-vacuolating
activity of vcc has been described (23, 25), but the membrane
traffic processes involved in vacuole biogenesis are still poorly
understood, although late endosomes, autophagosomes, and the
golgi complex may contribute to vacuole formation (25, 27).
recently, the role of the autophagic pathway in protecting
mammalian cells against various human bacterial pathogens has
been demonstrated (28–31). however, the role of autophagy in
response to bacterial toxins is still unknown. in this study, we
present evidence that a secreted toxin from v. cholerae (vcc) is
able to modulate autophagy in target cells. we also show that this
autophagic response is necessary to override the cytotoxic effect of
vcc and prevent cell death.

autophagy induction in cells intoxicated with vcc. (a) vcc is a
secreted hemolysin from v. cholerae that causes autophagy in several cell
lines. (aa–ad) cho-lc3 cells were incubated for 4 h with a ﬁlter-sterilized
supernatant from v. cholerae wt (vc-wt) (ab) or hlya⫺ (vc-hlya⫺) (aa) diluted
1:100. ac and ad show cho-lc3 with or without the addition of 7.5 pm
puriﬁed vcc for 4 h. (ae–ah) detection by indirect immunoﬂuorescence of
endogenous lc3 in human colonic-derived caco-2 cells (ae and af ) and in
c2bbe1 cells (brush border-expressing caco-2 clone) (ag and ah) with or
without the addition of 7.5 pm vcc for 4 h. arrows indicate punctate lc3-
labeled structures. confocal images are depicted. (scale bars: 10 ␮m.) (b) lc3
colocalizes with the vcc-generated vacuoles. (ba–bc) cho-lc3 cells were
treated with different concentrations of vcc as indicated (15– 60 pm) for 4 h.
increasing concentrations of the toxin induce not only a clear targeting of
gfp-lc3 to punctate structures but also localization of gfp-lc3 to the limiting
membrane of the vcc-generated vacuoles, as well as to the small internal
vesicles. (bd–bf ) cells were intoxicated with vcc 60 pm as described above and
subjected to immunoﬂuorescence to detect endogenous lc3 in cho, caco-2,
and c2bbe1 cells. arrows indicate vacuoles decorated by lc3. confocal images
are depicted. (scale bars: 10 ␮m.)
defective in vcc [see material and methods and supporting infor-
mation (si) fig. 6]. as shown in fig. 1ab, a 1:100 dilution of a sterile
culture supernatant from the v. cholerae wild-type strain clearly
induced gfp-lc3 targeting to punctated structures. when cho-
lc3 cells were incubated with the same dilution of sterile culture
supernatant from the v. cholerae hlya null mutant strain, no
changes in gfp-lc3 distribution were observed (fig. 1aa). to
confirm that the effects observed with supernatants were indeed
caused by the toxin, purified vcc was used. as expected, purified
vcc induced gfp-lc3 punctate distribution (fig. 1ad), whereas
no changes in gfp-lc3 distribution were induced under control
conditions (fig. 1ac) or after the addition of heat-inactivated vcc
(si fig. 7). in agreement with these observations, we also noted an
intense redistribution of the endogenous lc3 in cho and hek
cells (data not shown).
as mentioned above, the lc3 protein is processed for lipid

lc3 processing upon vcc intoxication. (a) vcc enhances lc3 pro-

with noninoculated bhi medium (1:100 dilution). after the indicated incuba-
tion times, protein cell extracts were subjected to sds/page and the gfp-lc3
forms (i and ii) or free cleaved gfp were detected by western blot analysis, as
described in materials and methods. nt, nontreated. (b) inhibition of lysoso-

culture supernatants from vc-wt or vc-hlya⫺ (1:100 dilution), with or without

before stimuli. as control, cells treated only with 1:100 dilution of bhi, 0.1%

conjugation upon autophagy induction, leading to a downward shift
in its electrophoretic mobility. as shown in fig. 2a, incubation of
cho-lc3 cells with vcc markedly enhanced the concentration of
the lipidated lc3 form (known as ‘‘lc3-ii’’ or ‘‘processed lc3’’).
it has been shown that the lc3-ii trapped inside autophagosomes
is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases after the formation of autoly-
sosomes, and the lysosomal turnover of lc3-ii, not a transient
increase, is indicative of autophagy induction (33). to determine
whether vcc is inducing autophagy and not blocking this pathway
with a consequent increase in the lc3-ii form, an experiment using
inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes was performed. when cells treated
with vc-wt supernatant were preincubated with lysosomal protease
inhibitors, the amount of gfp-lc3-ii was increased substantially
after 90 min of treatment, compared with cells treated with vc-wt
supernatant alone (fig. 2b). this result indicates that vcc is
actually inducing autophagy and not impairing this process. more-
over, experiments using dq bsa, a fluorophore dequenching upon
proteolysis and colocalization with cathepsin d, further supported
the degradative nature of vcc-generated vacuoles (si fig. 8). in
addition, it has been shown that the gfp fragment is relatively
stable to proteolysis and therefore accumulates in an autophagy-
dependent manner both in yeast and in mammalian cells (6, 34). as
shown in fig. 2a, the increased levels of free cleaved gfp
correlated well with lc3 conversion. therefore, the accumulation
of free cleaved gfp provides additional support regarding the
normal progression of the autophagic pathway in vcc-treated
cells.
taken together these results clearly indicate that vcc is the com-
ponent of v. cholerae supernatant capable of triggering autophagy.
because epithelial intestinal cells are the main target of vcc in
vivo, we studied the intracellular distribution of lc3 in related cell
lines after treatment with vcc. as observed for cho cells in the
human colonic-derived caco-2 and c2bbe1 cells, under control
conditions, endogenous lc3 showed a cytosolic pattern with a low
level of lc3 redistribution. however, incubation with a low dose of
vcc resulted in a remarkable increase in the punctate distribution
of lc3 (fig. 1 af and ah). this redistribution was also observed in

caco-2 and c2bbe1 cells after treatment with supernatants from
v. cholerae wild type but not with the v. cholerae hlya null mutant
(data not shown). taken together, these results indicate that vcc
is a secreted toxin of v. cholerae that causes autophagy induction in
different cells, including human colonic cell lines.
lc3 colocalizes with vcc-generated vacuoles in a broad range of
toxin concentrations. the above evidence prompted us to further
investigate the contribution of the autophagic pathway to vcc-
induced vacuoles. as mentioned previously, diverse cellular
effects are observed, depending on toxin concentration (25, 27).
consequently, cho-lc3 cells were exposed to several concen-
trations of purified vcc and we observed changes in gfp-lc3
distribution at all concentrations tested. however, the most
remarkable finding was that the large vcc-generated vacuoles
were clearly decorated with gfp-lc3 (fig. 1 ba–bc). given that
lc3 is the best-characterized marker of autophagosomes to date,
these data strongly suggest that autophagic compartments con-
tribute to the generation of the vacuoles caused by vcc. a
quantitative analysis indicated increased colocalization at higher
toxin concentrations (data not shown). interestingly, numerous
vacuoles displaying characteristics of multivesicular bodies that
contain internal gfp-lc3 vesicles were observed.
to further confirm our results, endogenous lc3 was detected by
using a specific polyclonal antibody. as shown in fig. 1bd, endog-
enous lc3 localized in the vcc-generated vacuoles in cho cells.
because different cell lines exhibit different sensitivity to vcc (27),
we also detected the distribution of endogenous lc3 in caco-2 and
c2bbe1 (fig. 1 be and bf), and the protein was strongly associated
with the vcc-generated vacuoles in these cell types.
ultrastructural analysis of vcc-generated vacuoles. to corroborate
that vacuoles caused by vcc presented autophagic characteristics,
cho cells were incubated with the toxin and subsequently analyzed
by electron microscopy. as shown in fig. 3a, vcc-generated
vacuoles exhibited characteristics of autophagic vacuoles sur-
rounded by double membranes (fig. 3ab, arrow), with multiple
membranes inside and partially degraded intracellular material
(fig. 3 aa and ac). in line with confocal microscopy observations,
the large vacuoles presented the typical multivesicular morphology,
including several small vesicles within the large vacuoles (fig. 3a).
moreover, the increased number of autophagosomes in the cyto-
plasm of the cells was in agreement with the vesicular pattern of
lc3 described above. we next extended our analysis to caco-2
cells. as shown in fig. 3ad, the vacuoles in these cells also exhibited
autophagic characteristics. these results indicate that the vcc
vacuoles are likely formed through interaction with autophagic
compartments.
autophagy is required for vcc-dependent vacuolization. because
the evidence presented here indicated that the autophagic
pathway contributes to vcc-induced vacuolization, we tested
the effect of autophagy inhibitors. cho cells overexpressing
gfp-lc3 were incubated with the toxin in the presence of the
autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-ma). as shown in fig.
3bb, this compound hampered not only lc3 redistribution but
also the localization of gfp-lc3 to the generated vacuoles.
moreover, the number of vacuoles was markedly decreased,
indicating that autophagy is essential for the biogenesis of the
vacuoles (fig. 3b, upper bar diagram).
the atg5-dependent conversion of lc3 is a key step in auto-
phagosome formation. we took advantage of atg5-deficient mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (atg5⫺/⫺ mef) (35) to analyze the conse-
quences in regard to vcc intoxication. as depicted in fig. 3bc,
incubation of wild-type mef cells with 60 pm vcc leads to an
intense vacuolization clearly labeled by lc3. in contrast, atg5⫺/⫺
mef cells were barely vacuolated, and lc3 remained cytosolic
(fig. 3bd). a quantitative analysis indicates that in atg5⫺/⫺ mef,

lc3 presented a cytosolic distribution (compare ba and bb). right shows a
quantitation of the number of vacuoles per cell at different vcc concentra-
tions and the effect of 3-ma in cell vacuolation. mef wt (bc) and mef atg5⫺/⫺

noﬂuorescence to detect lc3. arrows indicate generated vacuoles that colo-

the number of vacuoles was markedly reduced (fig. 3b, lower bar

vacuolization is largely dependent on the autophagic pathway.
vcc colocalizes to the membranes of the gfp-lc3-labeled vacuoles
generated by the toxin. it has been shown that, once vcc enters the
cell, it associates with the membranes of vesicles (27). to determine
whether the toxin was incorporated into the lc3-positive vacuoles
generated by vcc, cho-lc3 cells were incubated with the toxin,
and vcc was detected by immunofluorescence. as shown in fig.
4a, the toxin was clearly detectable in association with the vacuole
membranes. this localization was particularly evident when vacu-
oles became larger. remarkably, the toxin was also enclosed within

rab7 is a protein present on the membranes of autophagosomes
that has been shown to be required for the normal progression of
the autophagic pathway (36, 37). thus, we next addressed whether
the lc3-positive vcc-generated vacuoles were also positive for
rab7. for this purpose, cho cells overexpressing gfp-rab7-wt
(36) were incubated with vcc, and the endogenous lc3 distribu-
tion was determined. as shown in fig. 4b, upper panels, the
majority of the vacuole membranes were labeled with the gfp
signal. indeed, we observed a mixed population of vacuoles, some
labeled with both lc3 and rab7, some with lc3 alone, and others
with rab7 alone (fig. 4c). in cells overexpressing the gtpase-
defective mutant of rab7 (gfp-rab7-q67l), this protein also
colocalized with lc3 on the membranes of the vcc-generated
vacuoles (data not shown). furthermore, in line with a previous
report (27), we observed no inhibition of vacuolation when cho
cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of rab7 that does
not bind gtp (gfp-rab7-t22n) were incubated with the toxin.
additionally, the rab7-negative mutant was associated with the
membranes of the vcc-generated vacuoles (fig. 4b, lower panels),
as we described previously when autophagy was induced by amino
acid deprivation (36).
altogether, these results show that the toxin colocalized with

cell survival after treatment with vcc: the role of autophagy.
according to the evidence presented here, the vacuoles induced
by vcc are related to the autophagic pathway. however, a
relevant question was: what is the role of autophagy during this
intoxication process? one of the direct cellular consequences of
vcc is a potent cytocidal action (22). as expected, incubation
of cells with several dilutions of the filtered supernatants ob-
tained from v. cholerae wild-type strain caused a decrease in cell
viability in a concentration-dependent manner (fig. 5a). in
contrast, incubation of cells with the v. cholerae hlya null mutant
culture supernatant did not affect cell survival.
on the basis of cumulative evidence indicating that autophagy
plays a role in regulating cell survival vs. cell death, cells were
treated with different inhibitors of autophagy. we previously
showed that n-ethlymaleimide (nem)-sensitive proteins seem to
be required for the initial step of autophagosome formation (38).
upon vcc treatment, autophagy inhibition with 3-ma or nem
produced a mild decrease in cell survival (fig. 5a). these data
1832 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0601437104
gutierrez et al.
suggest that autophagy increases the ability of cells to survive upon
vcc intoxication. furthermore, autophagy inhibition with 3-ma
or nem also decreased caco-2 cell viability after incubation with
purified vcc, thus confirming the results obtained with v. cholerae
culture supernatants.
to further confirm the role of autophagy in cell survival,
wild-type and atg5⫺/⫺ mef cells were incubated with dilutions
of the culture supernatants from both wild-type and hlya null
mutant v. cholerae strains. as shown in fig. 5b, the lack of atg5
dramatically decreased cell survival after treatment with v.
cholerae wild-type culture supernatant or with purified vcc.
taken together, these results indicate that autophagy is not
only involved in cell vacuolation but also is required as a
defensive response upon vcc intoxication.
discussion
in the last few years, knowledge of the numerous mechanisms of
action of bacterial toxins has increased enormously (39, 40). these
studies have contributed both to molecular definition and to the
discovery of important pathways in mammalian cells (41, 42). the
autophagic pathway has been found to be involved in the elimina-
tion of certain intracellular pathogens (28–30); however, other
microorganisms exploit autophagy to survive and replicate within
specific intracellular compartments (43). in the present work, we
used sterile culture supernatants from a ct-negative v. cholerae
strain and from its isogenic hlya null mutant, as well as purified
vcc, and identified vcc as a v. cholerae-secreted toxin that
triggers autophagy. moreover, experimental evidence described
here indicates that the autophagic process activated by vcc
proceeds to completion. in this context, a clear enhancement of
gfp-lc3-ii accumulation was detected upon cell exposure to
vc-wt supernatant in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors
(fig. 2b). additionally, the amount of cleaved free gfp increased
progressively from 4 to 6 h after vcc intoxication. in agreement
with this result, vcc-generated vacuoles display features of a
degradative compartment, as measured by dq bsa, and clearly
colocalize with cathepsin d, a lysosomal hydrolase.
further experiments will be required in order to evaluate
whether other toxins, absent from this v. cholerae strain, might also
induce autophagy.
it has been proposed that vcc-induced vacuoles originate from
various intracellular compartments (25, 27), suggesting that other
intracellular pathways, beyond endocytosis, might contribute to the
biogenesis of the vacuoles. the results given here clearly indicate
that autophagy significantly contributes to the generation of the
vacuoles. the observation of lc3-decorated membranes in vcc-
generated vacuoles suggests that autophagic vesicles are compart-
ments from which vcc-induced vacuoles likely derive. this inter-
section with autophagic compartments was confirmed at an
ultrastructural level. interestingly, we observed small internal ves-
icles positive for lc3 and vcc. the origin of these vesicles is likely
explained by fusion of vcc vacuoles with double-membrane
lc3-labeled vesicles. another possibility is that the limiting mem-
brane of the vacuoles could be internalized by microautophagy, a
process that consists of direct invagination of membranes and
subsequent budding of vesicles into the vacuolar lumen (44). rab7
is a rab protein present on autophagic structures that is also
associated with the vcc-generated vacuoles (see ref. 27 and this
article). however, overexpression of rab7t22n did not block
vacuolization (ref. 27 and this article). this observation is likely due
to the fact that rab7t22n impairs the final stages of autophagy but
not autophagosome formation. indeed, we have shown that this
mutant causes autophagic vacuole accumulation (36).
autophagy has been suggested to be an evolutionary conserved
and self-limiting survival strategy (45). this pathway preserves cell
viability in several systems, but it has been also linked to self-
destruction (46). results presented here with a bacterial toxin
provide insights supporting the role of autophagy as a cell survival
mechanism. moreover, we present evidence that autophagy is a
cellular response to a secreted pore-forming bacterial toxin such as
vcc from v. cholerae. it is important to mention that the rela-
tionship between autophagy and toxins has been suggested before.
sandvig and van deurs (47) reported that inhibitors of autophagy
protect cells against ricin-induced lysis, suggesting that autophagy
was required for cell lysis to occur. in contrast, we found that rather
than being detrimental, the autophagic pathway is required in order
to improve the survival of cells upon vcc intoxication. these
differences could depend on the ability of each toxin to differen-
tially modulate the autophagic pathway, thus determining the final
outcome of cell viability. in the case of legionella, a bacterial
protein(s) is also able to induce autophagy, although the nature of
the factor has not yet been identified (31).
an important observation is that autophagy induced by vcc
is required for the survival of the cells, because when this
pathway is inhibited cell death proceeds more rapidly. these
observations are supported by two facts: (i) inhibition of auto-
phagy with 3-ma, a well known inhibitor of autophagy, or with
nem, a compound also able to inhibit autophagosome forma-
tion (38), decreased cell survival; and (ii) cells unable to undergo
autophagy, such as the atg5⫺/⫺ mef, were highly sensitive to
cell death upon vcc treatment. in a possible scenario, we
suggest that epithelial cells respond to a low dose of the toxin
with autophagy as a default protective pathway. whether this
phenomenon is a response of the cell itself, or is directly induced
by the toxin, is yet to be determined. the response that causes
massive vacuolization is likely related to the first attempt of the
cells to survive. this hypothesis is in agreement with the
observations that at low concentrations the toxin produces
vacuolization, whereas higher concentrations lead to cell lysis
(25, 27).
the discovery of a relationship between autophagy and cell
damage induced by vcc is important for two main reasons.
first, it aids in uncovering the exquisite molecular mechanisms
that participate in the development of v. cholerae infection, and
second,
it is useful as a tool for investigating the role of
autophagy as a cell survival response. in the context of bacterial
pathogenesis, it is essential to determine whether autophagy is a
protective intracellular pathway induced by other bacterial tox-
ins as part of a more general mechanism.
materials and methods
bacterial strains, supernatant preparation, and vcc purification. a
non-o1/non-o139 v. cholerae strain (vc-wt) isolated from a patient
suffering from a cholera-like syndrome was used for this study. the
strain was positive for the hlya and toxr genes and negative for ctxa,
zot, ace, tcpa, and stn genes, as determined by pcr analysis (48).
an isogenic hlya null mutant of this strain (vc-hlya⫺) was obtained
by insertional mutagenesis as described in ref. 49. tn10-insertion
into the hlya gene was confirmed by pcr and dna sequencing (si
fig. 6). to obtain the sterile culture supernatants, vc-wt and
vc-hlya⫺ were inoculated into brain–heart infusion broth (bhi)
and incubated at 37°c for 16 h with shaking (120 rpm). these
cultures were then centrifuged at 17,000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°c; the
supernatants were sterilized through 0.22-␮m low protein binding
filters (millipore, billerica, ma) and kept on ice until use. purified
vcc was obtained as described in ref. 50.
cell culture. mef, atg5⫺/⫺ mef, and c2bbe1 cells were cultured
by using dmem supplemented with 10% vol/vol fbs, caco-2 cells
were cultured in dmem supplemented with 20% fbs, and cho
cells were grown in mem (␣-mem) supplemented with 10% fbs.
stably transfected cho cells overexpressing gfp fusion proteins
were supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml geneticin.
indirect immunofluorescence. cells were grown on coverslips and
incubated with purified vcc or with dilutions of the culture

supernatants from v. cholerae. cells were fixed with 3% parafor-
maldehyde in pbs for 10 min at room temperature, washed with the
buffer, and blocked with 50 mm nh4cl in pbs. subsequently, cells
were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in pbs containing 0.2%
bsa and then incubated with primary antibodies. a rabbit poly-
clonal anti-vcc (51) (dilution 1:50) or a mouse polyclonal affinity-
purified anti-lc3 (dilution 1:50) were used. antibodies against lc3
were raised in mice and purified by affinity chromatography from
ascitic liquid. bound antibodies were detected by incubation with
cy3- or alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:800 and
1:400, respectively) (molecular probes, eugene, or). cells were
mounted with mowiol and examined by confocal fluorescence
microscopy. images were obtained with a nikon c1 confocal
microscope system and ez-c1 software (nikon, tokyo, japan).
images were processed by using adobe 7.0 (adobe systems, san
jose, ca).
transmission electron microscopy. purified vcc was added to cells
and, after 4 h of treatment, cells were fixed with 1% glutaral-
dehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (ph 7). monolayers were
scraped, postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 100 mm cacodylate
buffer, dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol,
and gradually infiltrated with epon resin (pelco, redding, ca).
thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and examined using a zeiss (thornwood, ny) em 900 trans-
mission electron microscope.
quantification of cell viability. cell viability was determined with
the celltiter aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (pro-
mega, madison, wi). this method allows the colorimetric deter-
mination of viable cells in cytotoxicity and also in proliferation
assays. its principle is based on detection of the bioreduction of the
tetrazolium compound into a formazan product in the presence of
an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate). because
this reaction is mediated by dehydrogenase enzymes found in
metabolically active cells, the quantity of formazan produced is
directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. cell
viability assays were performed in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s instructions (technical bulletin 169; promega). briefly,
2.5 ⫻ 104 cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates and incubated
for 24 h. for autophagy blockade, cells were incubated with 10 mm
3-ma or 20 ␮m nem for 1 h before the addition of sterile culture
supernatants or purified vcc. after 4 h of treatment, absorbance
at 490 nm was determined with a bio-rad (hercules, ca) micro-
plate reader.
western blot analysis. detection of forms i and ii of the gfp-lc3
protein by western blotting was performed essentially as described
in ref. 12. briefly, cho-lc3 cells were cultured to ⬇80% of
confluence and treated with filter-sterilized culture supernatants
from vc-wt or vc-hlya⫺ (1:100 dilution), with purified vcc (60
pm), with noninoculated bhi (1:100 dilution), or were left un-
treated. for inhibition of lysosomal protease enzymes, e64d and
pepstatin a (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) (10 ␮g/ml each) were
added to cell monolayers 2 h before treatment. after the indicated
times, cells were washed in cold pbs, scraped, and lysed. for
western blot analysis, 50 ␮g of protein extracts were subjected to
electrophoresis in 10% sds/page gels, transferred to a nitrocel-
lulose membrane, and blocked with tbs 1⫻ supplemented with
0.1% tween 20/5% nonfat dry milk. the nitrocellulose membrane
was incubated for 2 h with a rabbit polyclonal anti-gfp antibody
(abcam, cambridge, ma) at a 1:2,000 dilution, washed, and
incubated with a secondary hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(ge healthcare, bucks, u.k.) at a 1:10,000 dilution. after en-
hanced chemoluminescence reaction (supersignal west pico sys-
tem; pierce, rockford, il), the bands were visualized upon expo-
sition of nitrocellulose membrane to a ecl-hyperfilm (ge
healthcare).
