two morphological forms of programmed cell death, apoptosis and autophagic cell death, remove unneeded or damaged cells
during animal development. although the mechanisms that regulate apoptosis are well studied, little is known about autophagic
cell death. a shotgun proteome analysis of puriﬁed dying larval salivary glands in drosophila was used to identify proteins that
are expressed during autophagic programmed cell death. a total of 5661 proteins were identiﬁed from stages before and after the
onset of cell death. analyses of these data enabled us to identify proteins from a number of interesting categories including
regulators of transcription, the apoptosis, autophagy, lysosomal, and ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathways, and proteins
involved in growth control. several of the identiﬁed proteins, including the serine/threonine kinase warts (wts), were not detected
using whole-genome dna microarrays, providing support for the importance of such high-throughput proteomic technology.

programmed cell death is a fundamental component of animal
development, and disruption of normal cell death is asso-
ciated with several disorders including cancer and autoimmu-
nity.1 apoptosis and autophagic cell death are two prominent
morphological forms of cell killing that occur during animal
development.1–3 apoptosis occurs when isolated cells die,
and these cells are engulfed and degraded by phagocytes.4
by contrast, autophagic cell death is observed when groups of
cells or entire tissues are destroyed, and these cells appear to
degrade themselves with little or no help from phagocytes.3
studies of apoptosis have resulted in the identiﬁcation of a
conserved cell death pathway involving caspase proteases.5
although recent studies of cells dying by autophagic cell death
have implicated some of the conserved core apoptosis genes
in this morphologically distinct form of regulated cell death,6–8
the mechanisms that regulate autophagic cell death remain
poorly understood.
autophagic cell death is deﬁned by the presence of
autophagic vacuoles (also known as autophagosomes) that
are used to sequester and target components of
the
cytoplasm for degradation by the lysosome.9,10 autophagic
vacuoles have been observed in many types of dying cells in
diverse organisms, but little is known about the function of
autophagy in cell death. recent studies of mammalian cells
indicate that autophagy and atg genes are important for
caspase-independent death of cells,11,12 but the relationship
between autophagy and the death of cells is not clear.10
although such studies of cell lines enable useful insights into
the biochemical mechanisms that regulate cell death, it is
important to study dying cells in a physiological context in vivo.
autophagic cell death has been most frequently observed in
cells dying in the context of animal development.1,2 the
steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) triggers
programmed autophagic cell death during drosophila deve-
lopment. the ecdysone titer rises 10–12 h after puparium
formation, and triggers the synchronous death of
larval
salivary gland cells by activating a transcription regulatory
hierarchy. the ecdysone receptor, which is encoded by the
nuclear receptors ecr and usp,13 and the nuclear receptor
competence factor ftz-f1, activate transcription of the early
genes br-c, e74a, and e93.14,15 these early genes are
required for salivary gland cell death, and regulate transcrip-
tion of the apoptosis genes rpr, hid, the apaf-1 homolog ark,
and the caspases dronc and drice.16–18 salivary gland cell
death is preceded by markers of apoptosis including dna
fragmentation and nuclear acridine orange staining.16
although ecdysone triggers programmed cell death in
drosophila by activating the transcription of genes that
encode components of the core apoptosis machinery, several
differences exist in these dying cells. salivary gland cells
possess autophagic vacuoles that contain organelles includ-
ing mitochondria, and do not appear to be associated with
phagocytes during degradation, indicating that they die by
autophagic cell death.6,7 in addition, salivary gland degrada-
tion is not completely prevented by either

drice,19,20 suggesting that caspase-independent degradation
mechanisms may contribute to this alternative form of cell
death.
given the importance of cell death during development, and
the lack of information about autophagic cell death, we have
used high-throughput genomic approaches to investigate
dying salivary glands in drosophila. here we use a novel
proteomics approach to identify proteins that are expressed
before and during steroid-triggered autophagic cell death
during development. proteins that are known to function in
dying salivary glands, including ecdysone-response proteins,
transcription factors, caspases and caspase regulators, are
expressed in dying salivary glands. in addition, new proteins
that are involved in caspase-independent degradation
mechanisms and growth control were also expressed in
these dying cells. signiﬁcantly, the demonstration that wts
functions in destruction of salivary glands illustrates the
importance of complementary genomics approaches, as
several proteins that were identiﬁed using proteomics,
including wts, were not detected using whole-genome dna
microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (sage)
technologies to study these dying cells.18,21
results
identiﬁcation of proteins expressed during autophagic
cell death of salivary glands. a rise in the steroid hormone
20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone)
triggers larval salivary
gland autophagic programmed cell death.9,22 although
proteins associated with apoptosis, including caspases, are
induced and participate in the destruction of salivary glands,
the inhibition of caspases does not completely prevent
changes associated with dying cells.6,19,20 to identify
proteins that are expressed in salivary glands, soluble
proteins were extracted from salivary glands dissected from
wild-type animals that were staged 6 and 13 h after puparium
formation; stages before and immediately following the rise in
ecdysone that triggers cell death. two independent samples
of trypsin-digested proteins from each stage were separated
by capillary isoelectric focusing (ief), and 12 different
fractions were separated further by capillary reverse-phase
liquid chromatography. these fractions were analyzed using
a thermofinigan (waltham, ma, usa) lcq ion trap mass
spectrometer (ms). three ms/ms scans were performed
and raw data ﬁles were processed and submitted for
database searching using mascot (matrix science,
boston, ma, usa). we identiﬁed 3352 proteins in the 6 h
samples with greater than 95% conﬁdence, and 1111 of
these proteins contained two or more distinct peptide
sequences (table s1). similarly, 4523 proteins were
identiﬁed in the 13 h sample with greater
than 95%
conﬁdence, and 1907 of
these proteins were identiﬁed
based on two or more distinct peptide sequences. the total
number of proteins identiﬁed in both samples is 5661 with
2214 proteins common to both 6- and 13 h stages.
proteins that are known to be involved in salivary gland
programmed cell death were identiﬁed using this proteomic
approach. the ecdysone regulated proteins eip74ef (e74),
eip93f (e93), and the nuclear hormone receptors usp and
e75b were all detected using this approach (table s1), and
this is consistent with dna microarray studies18 and previous
these transcription regulators.17,23–25 caspase
studies of
proteases function in salivary gland cell death,6,7,16,26 and
several proteins that function during apoptosis were detected
including the caspase activator ark, and the caspases
strica/dream and nc/dronc, consistent with dna microarray
studies.18 these data provide conﬁdence that proteins that
are known to be involved in salivary gland programmed cell
death can be identiﬁed using this shotgun proteomics
approach, and that this can provide a valuable overview of
the proteome in dying cells.
identiﬁcation of new salivary gland proteins. although
the identiﬁcation of several known salivary gland proteins
provided evidence that this novel proteome technology is
sensitive, the validation of the presence of newly discovered
proteins is critical
to endear conﬁdence before investing
effort in reverse genetic studies. we analyzed our data for
previously studied proteins so that we could use available
antibodies to validate our salivary gland proteome data using
immunohistochemical staining. salivary glands were isolated
from wild-type canton s animals staged to 6 and 13 h
after puparium formation, ﬁxed and stained with available
antibodies against the drosophila insulin receptor (dinr),
kelch (kel), crumbs (crb), cactus (cact), quail (qua),
highwire (hiw), and osa.27–33 we had previously shown that
nuclear lamin dmo and a-spectrin are expressed in dying
salivary glands,7 and these antibodies were used as positive
controls.
whole-genome dna microarray studies indicated that
several of the identiﬁed salivary gland proteins are transcribed
in these cells,18 and we intitiated our validation by evaluating
the presence of these proteins (figure 1). dinr was identiﬁed
based on the detection of multiple distinct peptides and the
presence of rna using dna microarrays, and dinr antigen is
present in salivary gland cells. the actin-binding protein kel
and the cell polarity protein crb were both detected using
antibodies as expected based on the identiﬁcation of multiple
distinct peptides from each of these proteins, as well as
detection of their rnas in previous microarray studies. we
only detected a single peptide from the ikb protein cact, and
the presence of this nuclear factor kappa b regulator was
validated using antibodies as expected based on the
presence of cact rna in microarray studies. we then
addressed if the actin binding protein qua was present in
these cells, as quail rna was present at low levels in dna
microarray studies,18 and we only detected a single qua
peptide in our proteomic studies. the presence of qua
antigen in salivary glands provided greater conﬁdence that the
detection of single peptides using this approach can lead to
the identiﬁcation of proteins.
the identiﬁcation of low abundance proteins, and proteins
that may not be regulated at the level of rna transcription,
provides one of the greatest incentives for the development of
sensitive high-throughput proteomics technologies. to test
if we could detect proteins that were absent in our whole-
genome microarray studies,18 but were present
in our
proteomics data, we stained salivary glands with antibodies
against hiw and osa (figure 1). hiw encodes a putative
cell death and differentiation

several new proteins in this category including dhr96,
cactus, bunched, hsf and the mediator/trap proteins
med1, med14, and med17 (table 1) reﬂect the importance
of the regulation of rna levels in these dying cells. little is
known about the transcription coactivators and corepressors
that are involved in programmed cell death, and the
identiﬁcation of several proteins in these categories, including
hcf, nej, tai, brm, gug, h, hira, and smarter (smr), provides
a starting point for investigating their function in autophagic
programmed cell death (table 1).
salivary glands rapidly degrade during autophagic pro-
grammed cell death,6 and we hypothesize that many
categories of proteins may contribute to this process.
supporting this idea, we identiﬁed proteins involved in
apoptosis,
the ubiquitin proteasome system, autophagy,
lysosome biogenesis, and noncaspase proteases (table 2,
table s2). several proteins that function during apoptosis
were detected including the bcl-2 family members debcl and
buffy, the ubiquitin ligase morgue, the caspase activator ark,
and the caspases dream/strica and nc/dronc. the ubiquitin
proteasome system serves an important role in the degrada-
tion of short-lived proteins including caspase regulators. in
addition to the identiﬁcation of several proteasome compo-
nents (table s2), numerous proteins that are involved in the
regulation of ubiquitination were detected including bruce and
ago, as well as many others (table 2). autophagic vacuoles
form following the initiation of salivary gland cell death.
although the mechanism(s) by which autophagy is regulated
is not fully understood in these cells, the presence of the
autophagy proteins atg1, atg2, atg4, atg6, atg9, and the
atg18-like protein cg8678 are consistent with this catabolic
process being involved in salivary gland cell death (table 2).
autophagy requires lysosomes for the degradation of cargo,
and it is intriguing that several proteins involved in lysosome
biogenesis and organization, such as orange, ruby, and
garnet that were originally isolated based on defects in eye
pigmentation, were identiﬁed (table 2). given this result, we
tested if lysosomes are more abundant in later stages of
salivary gland cell death by using a fusion between the
lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (lamp1) and
horse radish peroxidase (hrp) that has been previously used
to detect lysosomes in drosophila.36. salivary glands isolated
from animals 12 h after puparium formation have large
vacuoles in every cell and little lamp1–hrp staining
(figure 2). by contrast, salivary glands dissected 14 h after
puparium formation possess increased lamp1-hrp staining

(figure 2). these results are consistent with the timing of
the induction of autophagy, and atg rna and proteins, that
immediately precede cell degradation6,18 (table 2), and

lysosome biogenesis may be important

that
dying salivary glands exhibit dynamic changes in structure
including the loss and formation of different types of vacuoles6
(figure 2), and the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized
independent of caspase activation.7 although some of these
changes could be caused by the cleavage of proteins by
proteases, other mechanisms may regulate reorganization of
the cytoskeleton and movement of structures during auto-
phagic cell death. consistent with this hypothesis, we
figure 1 veriﬁcation of proteome results by immunohistochemistry. salivary
glands of staged wild-type canton s animals were stained with antibodies against
either dinr (green) and nuclear lamin dmo (red), or a - spectrin (green) and
experimental antibodies (in red) against kel, crb, cact, qua, hiw, osa
ubiquitin ligase that regulates synaptic growth,34 and the
identiﬁcation of multiple distinct peptides was validated based
on hiw localization in the cytoplasm of salivary gland cells.
similar to hiw,
the transcription regulator osa was not
detected in our previous dna microarray studies, but osa
protein was present in the nuclei of salivary gland cells as
expected based on the identiﬁcation of multiple osa peptides.
although our previous use of this proteomics approach to
identify yeast proteins indicated the robust nature of this
technology,35 these data provide further evidence of
its
strength by identiﬁcation of numerous proteins from a
complex animal with a larger genome.
we identiﬁed many interesting proteins using this novel
high-throughput technology (table s1), thus our next interest
was to investigate what signaling pathways and cell
processes may be involved in the autophagic cell death of
salivary glands. transcription is known to play an important
role in this steroid-triggered cell death, and the identiﬁcation of
cell death and differentiation

an intricate relationship exists between cell growth and
proliferation, and programmed cell death during animal
development. growth and proliferation arrest are often
associated with the activation of apoptosis, but the relation-
ship between growth and autophagic cell death is unclear.
the insulin receptor (inr) signaling pathway is an important
mechanism for the regulation of growth. inr signaling may be
relevant to autophagic cell death, as autophagy is inﬂuenced
by the activity of several proteins within this pathway.37 we
identiﬁed many components of this pathway including inr, the
class i phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3 k) pi3k92e, the
tuberous sclerosis protein tsc1, the target of rapamycin
(tor), as well as 2 other inr-like proteins (table 3). in addition
to our identiﬁcation of the class i pi3 k, we also identiﬁed a
protein encoding the class ii pi3k68d (table 3).
wts functions in salivary gland cell death. mutations in
the serine/threonine kinase warts (wts) result in overgrowth
of adult tissues,38 and it was of interest that we identiﬁed two
distinct wts peptides in 13 h salivary glands (table s1). wts
is among the novel proteins identiﬁed in this study that were
not identiﬁed using dna microarrays.18 as wts has been
previously linked to the regulation of cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis, and encodes a tumor suppressor, we tested if wts
function is required for autophagic cell death of salivary
glands.
strong loss-of-function wts mutants are lethal before
puparium formation. therefore, we analyzed the weak wtsp2
allele for defects in salivary gland cell death.38 homozygous
wtsp2 and wtsp2 /wild-type control pupae were aged 12 h after
future adult head eversion which is 8 h after larval salivary
gland cell death is complete in wild-type ﬂies.6 these pupae
were embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained for
examination of cell death defects. in sections of control wtsp2
/wild-type, salivary glands are destroyed (figure 3). by
contrast, 100% of homozygous wts pupae had defects in
salivary gland destruction (figure 3), with 32% having intact
salivary glands and 68% having fragmented salivary glands
that are not properly degraded. although homozygous wts
pupae often exhibited over growth of imaginal tissues, this did
not prevent either head eversion or the normal development of
other structures. as wts functions in a pathway with hippo
(hpo), we also tested if expression of a previously studied

discussion
although much is known about the mechanisms that regulate
apoptosis,
little is known about alternative morphological
forms of cell killing including autophagic cell death. here we
have used a high-throughput approach to identify proteins in
dying salivary glands. this resulted in the identiﬁcation of
numerous factors that we expected based on previous whole-
genome microarray and sage studies,18,21 but we also
identiﬁed proteins that were not previously known to be
expressed in dying salivary glands. these data indicate that it
is important to combine proteomic approaches with genomic
technologies designed to detect rnas to get a complete
overview of the possible players involved in a cellular process.
the presence of a protein within a dying cell is not evidence
that this factor functions in cell death, and caution should be
taken before implicating innocent bystanders as being guilty
by association. therefore, such genomic approaches will be
most powerful when they are combined with genetic
approaches, and we now have a list of cellular processes
and signaling pathways that need to be investigated by
analyses of mutants.
previous studies have shown that a rise in the steroid
ecdysone triggers a transcription cascade that activates a
caspase-dependent autophagic cell death of salivary glands.9
this model has strong support, because mutations in primary
ecdysone-response transcription regulators prevent salivary
gland cell death,6 and these mutants also possess decreased
levels of caspases and caspase regulators.7 however, the
inhibition of caspases and caspase mutants do not prevent all
of the cellular changes associated with the death of salivary
glands,6,7,19,40 and suggest
that additional noncaspase
degradation mechanisms may be involved in the physiological
destruction of these cells. consistent with this hypothesis, our
genomic studies indicate that multiple noncaspase degrada-
tion systems, including autophagy, the ubiquitin proteasome,
and the lysosome, may be involved in the death of salivary
glands. furthermore, the presence and requirement for wts
that is not ecdysone-regulated indicates that post-transla-
tional mechanisms also contribute to the death of salivary
glands.
analyses of wts and hpo indicate that at least some of the
mechanisms that regulate tissue growth control also function
during autophagic cell death, but additional studies are
needed to determine the relationship between cell growth
and autophagic cell death. many growth regulators, including
several proteins in the wts and pi3k pathways, depend on
phosphorylation to modulate their activities, and studies of
post-translational modiﬁcation of proteins in dying salivary
glands should provide insights into the mechanisms that
mediate their cell death. the relationship between different

using regenerated cellulose membrane ﬁlters (millipore, billerica, ma, usa) with a
5000 molecular weight cutoff. trypsin (1:50, w/w, promega modiﬁed sequencing
grade, madison, wi, usa) was added and the mixture was incubated at 371c for
overnight.
independent samples of
trypsin-digested protein from each sample were
separated by capillary isoelectric focusing . twelve different ief fractions were
separated further by capillary reverse phase liquid chromatography, and analyzed
using a thermofinigan lcq ion trap ms. three ms/ms scans were performed on
the top three ions from the preceding ms scan. these data were processed using
distiller (matrix science) and submitted for database analyses using mascot
(matrix science). the database that was searched was a non-redundant
compilation of the swiss-plot and trembl drosophila melanogaster data sets
available from ebi.
immunohistochemistry. wild-type canton s salivary glands were dissected
from animals staged 6 and 13 h after puparium formation at 251c, ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde/heptane for 20 min at room temperature, blocked in phosphate-
buffered saline containing 1% bsa and 0.1%. triton-x (pbsbt), and incubated with
primary antibodies for 16 h at 41c. salivary glands were washed for 2 h in pbsbt,
incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for two hours at room temperature
and washed for another 2 h in pbsbt at room temperature. salivary glands were
mounted in vectashield (vector laboratories) and examined using a zeiss axiovert
100m confocal microscope.
histology. uas-hrp-lamp1 transgenic
ﬂies were kindly provided by
h. kramer.36 salivary glands were dissected from fkh-gal4; uas-hrp-
lamp1animals at speciﬁc stages during cell death. salivary glands were ﬁxed for
10 min in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in pbs, and incubated in 0.5 mg/ml dab and
0.03% hydrogen peroxide. staining of 12 and 14-h salivary glands in dab was done
for the same period of time so that these samples could be compared. for whole
mount analyses, salivary glands were then dehydrated, mounted in methyl
salicylate, and examined by light microscopy. for examination of thin sections by
transmission electron microscopy, dab-stained salivary glands were ﬁxed for an
additional hour in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, postﬁxed in 4% osmium tetroxide for 1 h,
embedded in spurr’s resin, sectioned, and analyzed using a zeiss em 10
transmission electron microscope.
for parafﬁn sections, control (either wtsp2/cantons, uas-hpoir/cantons, or
fkh-gal4/cantons) and experimental (either wtsp2/ wtsp2or fkh-gal4; uas-hpoir)
animals were maintained at 251c and aged to 12 h after head eversion. whole
pupae were ﬁxed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde and 5% acetic acid in
80% ethanol at 41c. fixed pupae were dehydrated through an ethanol series,
cleared in xylenes and inﬁltrated with parafﬁn. sections were cut at 7 mm, stained
with weigert’s hematoxylin and pollak trichrome and examined and photographed
using a zeiss axiophot ii microscope.
