juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is caused by mutation
of a novel, endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein encoded by
cln3. the observation that the mitochondrial atpase subunit
c protein accumulates in this disease suggests that autophagy, a
pathway that regulates mitochondrial turnover, may be dis-
rupted. to test this hypothesis, we examined the autophagic
pathway in cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice and cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebel-
lar cells, accurate genetic models of juvenile neuronal ceroid
lipofuscinosis. in homozygous knock-in mice, we found that the
autophagy marker lc3-ii was increased, and mammalian target
of rapamycin was down-regulated. moreover, isolated autoph-
agic vacuoles and lysosomes from homozygous knock-in mice
were less mature in their ultrastructural morphology than the
wild-type organelles, and subunit c accumulated in autophagic
vacuoles. intriguingly, we also observed subunit c accumulation
in autophagic vacuoles in normal aging mice. upon further
investigation of
the autophagic pathway in homozygous
knock-in cerebellar cells, we found that lc3-positive vesicles
were altered and overlap of endocytic and lysosomal dyes was
reduced when autophagy was stimulated, compared with wild-
type cells. surprisingly, however, stimulation of autophagy did
not significantly impact cell survival, but inhibition of autoph-
agy led to cell death. together these observations suggest that
autophagy is disrupted in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscino-
sis, likely at the level of autophagic vacuolar maturation, and
that activation of autophagy may be a prosurvival feedback
response in the disease process.
macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a non-
selective process by which cytoplasmic constituents are turned
over (reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). elegant work in yeast has led to
the genetic dissection of many of the proteins involved in this
pathway (3, 4), which are mostly conserved in mammals (5, 6).

the pathway is initiated at times of stress or nutritional depri-
vation to generate metabolites for cellular survival, but autoph-
agy is also responsible for normal housekeeping. although the
regulatory control of autophagy remains to be fully elucidated,
the general process from engulfment to degradation has been
delineated (2). initiation of the pathway involves de novo for-
mation of an isolation membrane that expands to engulf cyto-
plasmic constituents, including organelles, and encloses to
form a double membrane autophagic vacuole. this formed
autophagic vacuole is then increasingly acidified, and proteases
are delivered through fusion with late endosomes and lyso-
somes. the inner membrane is degraded to form a single mem-
brane autolysosome, where constituents are finally completely
degraded for recycling of metabolites to the cell.
autophagy is emerging as a major pathway involved in a
number of neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson
disease (7, 8), huntington disease (9–11), and alzheimer dis-
ease (12, 13). in each case, autophagic vacuoles accumulate,
suggesting that activation of autophagy is a common feature of
neurodegeneration. however, the events leading to autophagic
activation and how these impact any given disease process is
not yet understood, and it is likely that autophagic involvement
will differ in each case, since the diseases are clinically and
pathologically distinct.
the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls)3 are the most
common cause of neurodegeneration among children. these
recessively inherited disorders typically manifest with blind-
ness, seizures, progressive cognitive and motor failure, and the
ncls are always fatal (14). although heterogeneous in genetic
origin and some disease features, including age at onset, nearly
all of the ncls lead to lysosomal accumulation of subunit c of
the mitochondrial atpase f0 complex (15), implicating defects
in the turnover of this protein via the autophagic pathway. at
least seven distinct genetic loci cause ncl with subunit c accu-
mulation (reviewed in ref. 16). juvenile onset ncl (jncl;
batten disease; mim204200), the most common form of ncl,
results from recessive inheritance of cln3 mutations (17). a

disruption of autophagy in jncl
cln3 gene accounts for the majority of jncl disease alleles
(17). this mutation eliminates exons 7 and 8 and the surround-
ing intronic dna, giving rise to multiple stably produced
mutant cln3 mrna species encoding multiple mutant pro-
tein isoforms, which are presumably nonfunctional (17, 18).
the full-length cln3-encoded protein, battenin (also called
cln3 and cln3p), is a novel multipass transmembrane pro-
tein that localizes to the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane,
where it has been implicated in ph and amino acid homeostasis
(19, 20) and vesicle trafficking (21, 22).
we have established knock-in mouse (cln3⌬ex7/8 mice) (18)
and cerebellar culture models (cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells) (22) that
faithfully replicate the common jncl mutation in the murine
cln3 gene. as in jncl, central nervous system neurons and
noncentral nervous system cells in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
mice exhibit progressive accumulation of subunit c that begins
embryonically (18), and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar
cells accumulate subunit c when induced by aging at confluency
(22). in the studies described herein, we test the hypothesis that
autophagy is involved in the jncl disease process and the hall-
mark subunit c accumulation characteristic of ncl. these
results provide strong evidence supporting disruption of auto-
phagy in jncl and a direct role for the cln3-encoded protein,
battenin, in normal autophagy.

anti-lc3 antibodies (ap1802a; abgent, inc., and a generous gift
from dr. noboru mizushima), anti-mcln3p (23) and anti-sub-
unit c (24) antibodies (generous gifts from dr. junji ezaki and
dr. eiki kominami), anti-lamp 1 (1d4b; developmental stud-
ies hybridoma bank), anti-grp94 (c-19) and anti-cathepsin d

and anti-p70 s6 kinase antibodies (cell signaling technolo-
gies). other reagents were as follows: dextran-bodipy威 fl,

brain
from
10-month cln3⌬ex7/8 homozygotes and heterozygote and wild-
type littermates were processed and stained as previously
described (18).
immunohistochemistry—paraffin
cellular subfractionation and analysis of autophagic
vacuoles—autophagic vacuoles were isolated from freshly dis-
sected mouse livers by centrifugation in discontinuous density
gradients,
following an isolation protocol modified from
marzella et al. (25), as previously described (13). livers from
four individual littermates were pooled by genotype for the
fractionation procedure for each preparation. genotyping was
as previously described (22). the total volume of the starting
homogenate and the protein concentrations in the homogenate
and each fraction were tracked for subsequent determination of
the total protein in the fractions and normalization of densito-
metric data. for ultrastructural analyses, an aliquot of the puri-
sections
fied fractions was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glut-
araldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (ph 7.2),
supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose for maintenance of osmolar-
ity. fractions were subsequently processed for transmission
electron microscopy, as previously described (18). for immu-
noblot analyses, 10 ␮g of each fraction were run on standard
tris-glycine sds-page, except for immunoblots detecting
subunit c and lc3, which were run on tris-tricine sds-page.
for battenin immunoblot analyses, 10 ␮g of each fraction were
run on the 10% bistris nupage gel system (invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. all blots
were processed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second-
ary antibody incubation (amersham biosciences), followed
by chemiluminescence development
(western lightning,
perkinelmer life sciences). x-ray film detected the chemilumi-
nescent signal over increasing exposure times ranging from 10 s
to 10 min. for densitometric analyses, immunoblots were
scanned using a gs-800 calibrated densitometer and quantity
one software (bio-rad). the intensity of bands was quantified
with the volume rectangle tool, using local background deter-
mination. multiple exposure times were scanned, and values
were plotted to determine linearity. densitometric values used
for further analysis were taken from within the linear range.
notably, subunit c migrates in monomeric and sds-resistant
multimeric forms on sds-page, in a concentration-depend-
ent manner (26); therefore, the signal from both forms was used
for determination of “total subunit c” in the fractions. total
subunit c is defined as the densitometric measure of multimeric
and monomeric subunit c, determined from immunoblots, nor-
malized to the total protein content in the fraction.
em morphometric analyses—four to five images from ran-
dom fields were digitally captured at a magnification of ⫻6800
on a jeol 1200ex-80kv electron microscope. field size at this
magnification was ⬃46 mm2. digital images were scored for the
number of vesicles of the following subtypes: double mem-
brane, multivesicular, multilamellar, and multidense body.
double membrane structures were defined as those vesicles
with a discernable double outer membrane. multivesicular
structures were defined as vesicles of heterogeneous contents,
with two or more vesicles inside of a double outer membrane.
multilamellar structures were defined as heterogeneous vesi-
cles containing stacks of membrane contained within a single or
double outer membrane. multidense bodies were defined as
those vesicles containing heterogeneous contents, including
electron-dense spots contained within a single membrane. for
each category, an unpaired, two-tailed student’s t test was per-
formed to determine whether the means per frame for wild-
type versus homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 were significantly different.
lymphoblastoid and cerebellar cell culture—control and
jncl patient (homozygous 1.02-kb deletion) lymphoblastoid
cell lines were previously collected (17) and were grown for
these studies as previously described (27). cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cere-
bellar precursor cell lines have also been previously described
(22). cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells were transiently transfected
with the pcag-egfp-lc3 expression plasmid using lipo-
fectamine 2000 (invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. for drug studies, cells were plated on cov-
erslips in 12-well plates or 60-mm dishes at the appropriate

and this band is highly enriched in the autophagic vacuole fractions (av15 and av20) and in the lysosomal (lys)
fraction. this band is not seen in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 fractions, although a faint smear in that region is
present in the av20 fraction. faint, novel, low molecular weight bands (⬃30 kda, arrows) are detected on
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 immunoblots in the e, av15, av20, and lysosomal fractions. a longer exposure (av15*,
av20*, and lys*) is shown, for better visualization of these faintly detected bands. this antibody also detects
prominent bands at ⬃28 and ⬃42 kda that fractionate predominantly with the cytosol and a cross-reactive
band at ⬃50 kda that fractionates with mitochondria (mito). the identity of these bands is unknown, but they
do not differ between wild-type (cln3⫹/⫹) and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 immunoblots.

results
activation of autophagy in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice—
to first test the hypothesis that autophagy is involved in the
pathophysiology of jncl, we exam-
ined the state of autophagy in
cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice. lc3 is a
microtubule-associated protein that
is lipidated upon activation of auto-
phagy (lc3-i, unlipidated; lc3-ii,
lipidated). lc3-ii tightly associates
with the preautophagosomal and
autophagosomal membrane and thus
is considered a marker of autophagy
(28). we first probed brain sections
with an lc3 antibody that detects
bothformsoflc3(see“experimental
procedures”). whereas only occa-
sional lc3 immunopositive puncta
were observed in brain sections from
control mice (wild-type or heterozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 littermates), strong
lc3 immunopositive puncta were
observed in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8

represent results from morphometric analyses of micrograph images (mean per frame ⫾ s.d.). double membrane (dm) vesicles, typical of avs, are most
abundant in the av fractions, and the recovered lysosomal fraction is enriched in lysosomes (l), as expected. double membrane structures are distributed
similarly for wild-type (blue bars) and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in (red bars) fractions, although a slight elevation in these structures is seen in the
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 av20 fraction (*, p ⬍ 0.05). the abundance of double membrane multivesicular bodies (mv) is the same across all of the fractions,
although a slight reduction of multivesicular bodies is observed in the lysosomal fraction from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver (**, p ⬍ 0.01). multilamellar (ml)
structures are abundant throughout the av and lysosomal fractions from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver, but these are only occasionally observed in the
wild-type fractions (***, p ⬍ 0.001). multidense bodies (md; white asterisk) are often seen in wild-type av fractions, but these are reduced in the av fractions
from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver (av15 did not reach significance, p ⫽ 0.08; av20, **, p ⬍ 0.01). note that multidense bodies are not typical of the lysosomal
fraction. in the micrograph images, the arrows indicate multilamellar structures, and the arrowhead points to a large av filled with membranes. scale bar for all

brain, in regions known to exhibit significant mitochondrial
atpase subunit c accumulations, including the purkinje cells of
the cerebellum, ca2/3 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus,
and periventricular cells (18) (fig. 1a). to more specifically deter-
mine the proportion of lc3 that was in the lc3-ii form, which
migrates faster than lc3-i on sds-page and is the form associ-
atedwiththeautophagosomalstructures,weperformedimmuno-
blot analyses and densitometry of lc3-i and lc3-ii in wild-type
(cln3⫹/⫹) and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 whole brain extracts. ele-
vated lc3-ii/lc3-i ratios in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in
brain, relative to wild-type brain, were observed at each age exam-
ined. these observations are consistent with an increased activa-
tion of autophagy in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice.
battenin is highly enriched in purified autophagic vacuoles—
to more closely examine the autophagic pathway, we per-
formed a previously established fractionation procedure (13)
to isolate high purity autophagic vacuoles (av) from wild-
type and cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in liver for subsequent immuno-
blotting and structural studies. this procedure allows the iso-
lation of autophagic vacuoles of two different densities, a light
fraction (av15) particularly enriched in autophagosomes and a
heavy fraction (av20) predominantly consisting of autoph-

dria (23), were not different on wild-
type and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
blots.
ultrastructural abnormalities of
purified autophagic vacuoles from
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice—
during the fractionation of avs
from wild-type and homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 liver, we noted an in-
triguing trend of reduced protein
content in the av15, av20, and ly-
sosomal fractions from homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver, compared
with the wild-type fractions, which
worsened with age (data not
shown). these observations sug-
gested abnormalities in the av and
lysosomal organelles from homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver. therefore, we
sought to examine further the ultra-
structural morphology of the puri-
fied av and lysosomal fractions.
comparison of the av15, av20,
and lysosomal fractions from wild-
type (cln3⫹/⫹) mice revealed an ap-
parent progressive maturation and
degradation of contents with in-
creasing sedimentation, where the
engulfed components were no lon-
ger evident in the vesicles recovered
in the lysosomal fraction (fig. 3),
consistent with previous observa-
tions (12, 13). in contrast, this trend
was not observed in the fractions
from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver.
instead, vesicles in both av frac-
tions and in the lysosomal fraction from homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 liver were full of multilamellar membranes, consist-
ent in appearance with the “fingerprint-like” storage material
observed in jncl. moreover, avs with dense cores were seen
in the av fractions from wild-type (cln3⫹/⫹) mice, but these
structures were not often observed in the homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 av fractions (fig. 3).
subunit c accumulates in autophagic vacuoles in homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 and aged wild-type mouse liver—the hall-
mark storage of mitochondrial atp synthase subunit c in jncl
is thought to occur at the level of the lysosome (15). however,
given that the subunit c protein is predicted to traffic to the
lysosome via the autophagic pathway (29), we sought to more
precisely pinpoint the organelle in which subunit c predomi-
nantly accumulates. utilizing the purified av and lysosomal
fractions from wild-type and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in
liver, we performed a semiquantitative analysis of subunit c
distribution by
immunoblotting and densitometry. as
expected, immunoblots of subunit c revealed enrichment of
this protein in mitochondrial fractions (fig. 4a). moreover,
consistent with autophagic-lysosomal turnover of mitochon-

agolysosomes. given the hypothesized role of autophagy in
jncl and the observed changes in autophagosomal-like struc-
tures in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice (18), we examined the
two av fractions separately.
to first determine whether the cln3-encoded protein, bat-
tenin, was present in the different av fractions, which might
suggest a direct role for battenin in the autophagic pathway, we
probed immunoblots of wild-type (cln3⫹/⫹) and homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 fractions using a previously characterized anti-bat-
tenin antibody (23). on wild-type immunoblots, we observed a
faint ⬃60–65-kda smear (asterisk in fig. 2) in the homogenate
and tubulovesicular fraction (e; mostly consists of er), which
was remarkably enriched in the av15, av20, and lysosomal
fractions, and this band was missing on homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
blots, as expected. consistent with stable mutant mrnas and
low abundance mutant battenin species in homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 mouse tissues (18), a novel faint smear at ⬃25–30
kda fractionating with avs and lysosomes was detected on
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 blots (arrows in fig. 2). additional uni-

both wild-type and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver. also note that the subunit c distribution pattern for homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice consistently displays more enrichment in the av15 and lysosomal fractions, whereas the

immunoblots
confirmed the purity of the frac-
tions, and no major differences in
distribution of these markers were
observed between the wild-type and
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver frac-
tions (fig. 4b). however, lc3-ii
recovery was higher (⬃2–3-fold) in
the av15 fraction from homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver, compared
with wild type (fig. 4a), consistent
with our previous observations in whole brain extracts (fig. 1b).
notably, lamp 1 and cathepsin d recovery were also increased
(⬃2–3-fold) in the av15 fraction from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
liver, compared with wild type (fig. 4b and data not shown).
fractions
given the progressive nature of subunit c accumulations in
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 mice and jncl patients (18, 30), the
accumulation of subunit c in the purified avs was assessed at
different ages. as expected, subunit c recovery from purified
in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
av and lysosomal
knock-in liver increased from 4 to 12 months (fig. 5). surpris-
ingly, however, an age-related increase in subunit c recovery
from purified av and lysosomal fractions was also observed for
wild-type liver. unlike the subunit c accumulation in homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in fractions, which occurs largely in the
av15 fraction, subunit c was particularly increased in the av20
fraction from wild-type aged mouse liver. moreover, total sub-
unit c recovery in both wild-type and homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
knock-in av and lysosomal fractions was surprisingly high.
down-regulation of mtor in jncl—our observations at the
level of lc3 suggest that autophagy may be activated in both
brain and liver from homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice,
although the maturation of the formed vesicles may be
impaired. the mtor pathway is known to negatively regulate
autophagy (31, 32). to examine the involvement of the mtor
pathway in jncl pathophysiology, we probed the state of
mtor activation in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice. as
shown in fig. 6a, we found significantly reduced levels of phos-
pho-mtor in 6-month homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 brain, com-
pared with cln3⌬ex7/8 heterozygous and wild-type littermates.
to determine whether our observations in homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 mice were also reflected in cell culture, we expanded
the analysis of mtor activation to include jncl patient lym-
phoblastoid cells and cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells, which we
previously established from cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice (22). as
shown in fig. 6b, the phosphorylation levels of the immediate
downstream target of mtor, p70 s6 kinase, were significantly
reduced relative to those observed in control lymphoblast cell
figure 6. mtor down-regulation in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 brain and

immunoblots of wild-type (cln3⫹/⫹), heterozygous (cln3⫹/⌬ex7/8), and
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 (cln3⌬ex7/8/⌬ex7/8) brain extracts are shown, probed to
determine the activation state of mtor. a triplet of bands at ⬃290 kda is
more faintly labeled with an antibody directed against phosphorylated
ser2448 (phospho-mtor), relative to total mtor, in homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
brain extracts compared with wild-type or heterozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 brain
extracts. densitometry showed a ⬃1.4-fold reduction in phospho-mtor, in
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 extracts (p ⬍ 0.05). b, representative immunoblots of
control and jncl patient lymphoblast extracts and wild-type (cbcln3⫹/⫹)
and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 (cbcln3⌬ex/8/⌬ex7/8) cerebellar cell extracts are
shown, probed to determine the activation state of the immediate down-
stream target of mtor, p70 s6 kinase (p70 s6k). a ⬃70-kda band is more
faintly labeled with an antibody directed against phosphorylated thr389
(phospho-p70 s6k) in jncl patient and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 extracts,
relative to total p70 s6 kinase, compared with control lymphoblast and wild-
type cerebellar cell extracts. densitometry showed this reduction to be
⬃2-fold (p ⬍ 0.05) and ⬃3-fold (p ⬍ 0.05), respectively.
dria, undegraded subunit c protein was also readily detectable
in av fractions and lysosomes from both wild-type and
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in liver. densitometric semi-
quantitative analyses of total subunit c, determined by normal-
ization of densitometric units to total protein content in each
fraction (see “experimental procedures”), revealed a markedly
enhanced recovery of subunit c in the homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8
knock-in av15 fractions, relative to wild-type av15 fractions

respectively), consistent with activation of autophagy. the lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio for homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cell extracts is consistently higher than the ratio
observed in wild-type extracts (3.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively; p ⬍ 0.05). b, the bar graph depicts results of a typical subunit c inclusion assay, following 48-h
rapamycin treatment (25 nm). untreated (me2so only) wild-type (blue bars) and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells (red bars) display ⬃2 subunit c immunopositive
inclusions per frame (⫻60 magnification). rapamycin treatment does not increase subunit c inclusions in wild-type cells but approximately doubles subunit c
immunopositive inclusions to ⬃5 per frame in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells (***, p ⬍ 0.001). c, representative micrographs are shown for wild-type
and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells, transiently transfected with plasmid expressing gfp-lc3 to mark autophagic vacuoles. the typical large, mature
gfp-lc3-positive autophagic vacuoles in the perinuclear region of the wild-type micrograph are not frequently observed in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells.
numerous smaller gfp-lc3-positive autophagic vacuoles are commonly observed in the perinuclear region and in the cytoplasm of homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8
cerebellar cells. d, representative micrographs are shown for a combined endocytic uptake (green) and lysotracker (red) assay. a reduction in lysotracker stain
and endocytic uptake is observed in untreated homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells (cbcln3⌬ex7/8/⌬ex7/8), compared with wild-type cells (cbcln3⫹/⫹).
rapamycin treatment (100 nm, 4 h) up-regulates both endocytic uptake and lysotracker stain in wild-type and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells. note that
rapamycin treatment also enhances the overlap of the endocytic stain and lysotracker in the wild-type cells, but less overlap is observed in the homozygous

also down-regulated (data not shown).
impaired autophagic trafficking in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8
cerebellar cells—although autophagy may be up-regulated in
our genetic models of jncl, the formed avs may not mature
normally, leading us to consider a possible defect in av clear-
ance. this prompted a more detailed examination of autoph-
agic trafficking in jncl utilizing cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells.
we have previously demonstrated that homozygous
cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells do not exhibit detectable subunit c accumula-
tion under normal growth conditions, although subunit c inclu-
sionswereinducedbyagingcellsatconfluency,whichmayup-reg-
ulate autophagy (22). to directly test whether stimulation of
autophagy leads to subunit c accumulation in homozygous
cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells, we treated cells with the mtor
inhibitor, rapamycin, and followed subunit c inclusion formation.
the ability of rapamycin to up-regulate autophagy was first con-
firmed in our cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cell lines by following lc3-ii levels.
consistent with our in vivo observations (fig. 1b), untreated
homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cell extracts exhibited more
lc3-ii, relative to lc3-i, than wild-type cells, and rapamycin up-
regulated the lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio in both wild-type and homozy-
gous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells (fig. 7a). likewise, stimulation of autoph-
agybyrapamycintreatmentledtosubunitcinclusionformationin

ther evidence that subunit c accumulation in jncl occurs via the
autophagic pathway.
we also examined lc3 by transfection with a plasmid
expressing gfp-lc3. in wild-type cerebellar cells, we observed
scattered, small avs and large, perinuclear vesicles that were
consistent in appearance with maturing avs (33) (fig. 7c).
however, homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells infre-
quently contained the large, perinuclear structures but con-
tained numerous small avs (fig. 7c), consistent with a defi-
ciency in av maturation.
av maturation requires fusion with late endosomes and
lysosomes, which leads to acidification and proteolytic acti-
vation for degradation of the av cargo (5, 6). we have pre-

cerebellar cell survival. representative graphs of cerebellar cell survival are
shown, following rapamycin treatment or 3-ma treatment to induce or

halts cell division but does not significantly (p ⬎ 0.05 for all) impact wild-type
(blue diamonds) or homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 (red squares) cell survival. con-
versely, 3-ma treatment (0.5–10 mm) reduced cell survival (did not reach sig-
nificance for wild type, p ⫽ 0.08; homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cell loss was
significant at 2.5, 5, and 10 mm, p ⬍ 0.05). homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells
were more severely affected by 3-ma than wild-type cells, at all doses
tested (p ⬍ 0.05).
viously shown that both endosomes and lysosomes exhibit
abnormalities in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells
(22), leading us to hypothesize that the steps in av matura-
tion that require endosomal and lysosomal function are dis-
rupted in jncl. as a first step in examining trafficking and
fusion between endocytic and lysosomal compartments in
homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells, we performed a combined
endocytic uptake and lysotracker staining assay, with or
without the induction of autophagy by rapamycin. as we
have previously reported (22), the endocytic and lysotracker
(labels lysosomes and autophagolysosomes) dyes were
reduced in untreated homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar
cells, relative to untreated wild-type cerebellar cells (fig.
7d). upon rapamycin treatment in both wild-type and
homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells, the endocytic and lyso-
tracker stains were increased, and overlap of the two dyes
was more evident (fig. 7d). comparison of the rapamycin-
treated homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells with the
rapamycin-treated wild-type cells revealed a similar reduc-
tion in stain to that observed for untreated cells, but we also
observed ⬃4-fold reduction in the co-localization rate of
these two markers in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells, rela-
tive to the wild-type cells (wild type ⫽ 17 ⫾ 10.5% versus
4.6 ⫾ 2.6%; p ⬍ 0.01) (fig. 7d). these observations support
the hypothesis that trafficking between endocytic and auto-
phagolysosomal/lysosomal compartments, which involves
vesicle fusion, is abnormal in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cer-
ebellar cells.
inhibition of autophagy reduces cell viability—autoph-
agy is both a prosurvival pathway and an important pathway
leading to programmed cell death (34). to dissect the rela-
tionship of autophagy and cell death in wild-type and
homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells, we assessed cell survival fol-
lowing treatment with rapamycin or 3-ma, a broad phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor widely recognized as an
inhibitor of autophagy (13, 35). as shown in fig. 8, doses of
rapamycin that induce autophagy (20 and 50 nm) halted cell
growth but did not lead to significant cell loss in either wild-
type (cln3⫹/⫹) or homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells. higher
rapamycin doses (0.25 and 1 ␮m) led to slightly reduced cell
survival (⬃90%) in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells over the
48-h treatment period, but these levels of cell loss never
reached significance (p ⬎ 0.05). by contrast, 3-ma treat-
ment, at doses commonly used to inhibit autophagy (5–10
mm) (35), resulted in significant cell loss in both wild-type
and homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells, but more markedly in
the latter. survival of homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells was
significantly reduced, compared with wild-type cerebellar
cell survival at all 3-ma doses tested (fig. 8). similar studies
with control and jncl patient lymphoblasts supported these
observations, where significant cell loss was only observed
following 3-ma treatment (data not shown).
discussion
these studies utilizing jncl patient cells and genetically accu-
ratemouseandcerebellarcellculturemodels,whichfaithfullyrep-
licate the common jncl mutation, demonstrate an important
role for autophagy in the turnover of atpase subunit c and in
jncl disease phenotypes. furthermore, surprising properties of
atpase subunit c distribution in membrane organelles and in
aging were revealed. most importantly, our studies implicate dis-
ruption of autophagy in cells homozygous for the common jncl
mutation, including patient lymphoblastoid cells, as depicted in
the hypothetical model in fig. 9.
the observation that subunit c accumulation in homozy-
gous cln3⌬ex7/8 liver is not restricted to the lysosome but is
most evident in the light av fraction suggests that there is a
delay in the maturation of avs to fully degradative autolyso-
somes in jncl. the ultrastructural studies showing marked
changes in the degradation of the av contents support this
hypothesis. although the different properties of the two av
populations are not yet entirely understood, the light av15
fraction exhibits properties consistent with autophago-
somes, whereas the denser av20 fraction is more autoph-
agolysosomal, with acidifying ph and proteolytic enzymatic
activity (36). indeed, the ultrastructure of the purified
organelles in this study supports this distinction between the
two av populations. thus, our observations of predominant
accumulation of subunit c in the light av15 fraction are
consistent with a delay in maturation of avs in jncl. a
similar expansion of the autophagic intermediates has been
described previously in other conditions, such as alzhei-

disruption of autophagy in jncl
figure 9. hypothetical model of the disrupted autophagic pathway in jncl. a hypothetical feedback cycle that regulates autophagy is depicted for a
normal cell and a jncl cell. in both cases, the initiation of autophagy is negatively regulated by mtor (gray); phosphorylated (p) mtor inhibits initiation of the
pathway, and dephosphorylation of mtor leads to up-regulation of autophagy. lc3-ii (yellow circles) coats the membrane of the forming avs (light blue) and
remains associated with the avs as they mature to become autolysosomes (orange). the forming avs engulf mitochondria and the subunit c protein, which are
then matured through fusion with late endosomes (le; green) and lysosomes (l; red). in the normal cell, full-length cln3/battenin (dark blue triangles) likely sits
on the membrane of late endosomes, lysosomes, intermediate avs, and autolysosomes, where it may function to regulate av maturation via modulating
trafficking, vesicle fission/fusion, and/or endosomal/lysosomal/av function. in jncl, full-length, functional cln3/battenin is absent from these membranes,
which likely leads to deficient av maturation and a build-up of av intermediates, which contain subunit c and the membranous material observed by
transmission electron microscopy. a failure to efficiently turn over this av cargo in the jncl cell may lead to nutrient deprivation and a cellular response to
down-regulate mtor and up-regulate autophagy. this up-regulation of autophagy in the jncl cell, which may also arise via atp depletion, may further
contribute to the build-up of av intermediates containing undegraded cargo, such as subunit c. the solid lines depict membrane trafficking pathways, and

mer’s disease, where autophagic clearance through to the
lysosome is thought to be impaired (12, 13). the specific
defect that leads to the accumulation in jncl may involve
fission and/or fusion defects between the formed avs and
late endosomes and lysosomes, leading to a reduction in avs
containing mitochondria and subunit c, which normally sed-
iment in the av20 fraction. this notion is supported by our
cell biological studies in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebel-
lar cells in which trafficking between endosomal and lysoso-
mal compartments is altered. moreover, the observation
that battenin is highly enriched in the membranes of avs is
suggestive for the first time that battenin plays a direct role
in av organelle maturation toward the lysosome. the spe-
cific battenin function that contributes to av maturation
could involve trafficking of the avs, endosomes, and/or
lysosomes, or it may be that battenin helps guide fission/
fusion via membrane protein interactions or by directly reg-
ulating organelle properties, such as membrane dynamics,
enzyme activation, ph, and/or ion homeostasis. consistent
with these hypotheses, endosomal and lysosomal trafficking
defects (21, 22) and lysosomal ph alterations (19, 37) are
common findings in jncl.
that subunit c was also highly enriched in av and lysosomal
fractions from wild-type mice was a remarkable finding. this
suggests that subunit c accumulation may not be specific to
ncl, although the precise mechanisms underlying this phe-
nomena may be different in aging, compared with jncl, given
the distinct profiles of subunit c accumulation in the av and
lysosomal compartments from wild-type aged liver and
homozygous cln3⌬ex7/8 knock-in mice. consistent with this
hypothesis, declining autophagic-lysosomal
function is an
established occurrence in normal aging (38), and subunit c
accumulation is observed in other lysosomal disorders, such as
mucolipidosis type 1 and 2 (30). moreover, knock-out mice
deficient for cathepsins (including cathepsins d, b, and l)
exhibit significant autophagy-mediated subunit c accumula-
tion (39). however, we previously reported that cathepsin d
enzymatic activity is not significantly altered in homozygous
cln3⌬ex7/8 mice and cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cerebellar cells, although
cathepsin d trafficking may be altered (22). these observations
argue that subunit c accumulation in jncl does not arise from
cathepsin d deficiency but more likely occurs via mechanisms
distinct from those giving rise to subunit c accumulation in
cathepsin d knock-out mice. therefore, further study of the
autophagic pathway in other lysosomal disorders and in aging,
to elucidate the distinct mechanisms and consequences of sub-
unit c accumulation in avs, is warranted.
the events that lead to down-regulation of mtor signaling
and up-regulation of autophagy in jncl are not yet clear, but
our results suggest that this may be a prosurvival response dur-
ing the jncl disease process (see fig. 9), since further up-reg-
ulation of autophagy fails to significantly impact cell survival,
but inhibition of autophagy leads to cell death, most likely by
apoptotic mechanisms (35, 40). mtor-mediated autophagy is
known to be stimulated by cellular stress, energy depletion, and
nutrient deprivation (2). these are all established phenotypes in
jncl cells. for example, we and others have reported reduced
atp and increased sensitivity to cellular stressors in the pres-
ence of the common jncl mutation (22, 41), and amino acid
transport defects lead to reduced cytoplasmic levels of the

amino acid arginine in jncl (20). moreover, utilization of
extracellular nutrients requires endocytosis, and intracellular
nutrients are generated by autophagic turnover of organelles
and long lived proteins, both pathways that are compromised in
jncl (21, 22). however, the up-regulation of autophagy in
jncl is unlikely to produce long term benefits for the cell, given
that our data strongly suggest that autophagy may be deficient
at the level of av maturation due to the lack of normal battenin
function.
aging is likely to further aggravate the disruption of autoph-
agy in jncl, and indeed the disease is progressive over several
decades, culminating in massive neuronal loss and death. auto-
phagy exhibits a functional decline with age, both at the level of
activation of the pathway and in fusion of avs with lysosomes
(38). intriguingly, undigested material in avs, in the form of
lipofuscin, may further disrupt the fusion process (38). there-
fore, although the primary defect in av maturation may be due
to loss of normal battenin function at the av/lysosomal mem-
brane, given that we observe maturation defects in the absence
of subunit c accumulation in homozygous cbcln3⌬ex7/8 cells
(this study) (22), the accumulation of subunit c could worsen
this critical step in the pathway. moreover, it has been proposed
that neurons and cardiac myocytes are most vulnerable to the
age-related changes in autophagy and that this may lead to the
accumulation of damaged mitochondria (42, 43). it is therefore
tempting to speculate that the defect in autophagy, resulting
from the loss of normal battenin function, may explain the clin-
ical specificity of the symptoms of jncl, which are predomi-
nantly to the nervous system (44) but also have been shown to
include the myocardium (45).
finally, the results of our studies suggest that the accurate
genetic mouse and cellular models of jncl, the most common
neurodegenerative disease afflicting children, will be useful sys-
tems for study of other disorders with altered autophagic-lyso-
somal trafficking or turnover of mitochondria through this
pathway. further investigation of the biology of battenin and
the subunit c protein in this pathway will not only advance ncl
research but will also contribute to a greater understanding of
neurodegenerative disease and aging.
