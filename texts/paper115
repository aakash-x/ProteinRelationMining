gene expression proﬁling identiﬁes fkbp39 as an
inhibitor of autophagy in larval drosophila fat body
g juha´sz*,1,2, lg puska´s3, o komonyi4, b e´ rdi1, p maro´ y4, tp neufeld2 and m sass1
in drosophila, the fat body undergoes a massive burst of autophagy at the end of larval development in preparation for the pupal
transition. to identify genes involved in this process, we carried out a microarray analysis. we found that mrna levels of the
homologs of atg8, the coat protein of early autophagic structures, and lysosomal hydrolases were upregulated, consistent with
previous results. genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and many chaperones were downregulated, including the inhibitor of
eif2alpha kinases and the peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase fk506-binding protein of 39 kda (fkbp39). genetic manipulation
of fkbp39 expression had a signiﬁcant effect on autophagy, potentially through modulation of the transcription factor foxo.
accordingly, we found that foxo mutants cannot properly undergo autophagy in response to starvation, and that overexpression
of foxo induces autophagy.

autophagy is the degradation of self material by lysosomes.
as a primary cellular defense response, it is activated by
nitrogen or amino-acid starvation from yeast to mammals, and
promotes the survival of the cell or organism by recycling
dispensable cellular constituents for
re-use in synthetic
processes. the morphology of the major pathway is well
known for decades by electron microscopical studies.1 in
response to starvation or other stimuli, a membranous sac
called isolation membrane forms and engulfs portions of
the cytosol. after sealing of its edges, the emerging double-
membrane organelle is referred to as an autophagosome.
upon fusion with a lysosome an autolysosome is formed,
where degradation of
takes
place. the process of autophagy is remarkably similar in
all eukaryotic organisms, suggesting the involvement of
an evolutionary conserved set of genes. indeed, functional
homologs of most atg (autophagy-related) genes required
for autophagy in yeast were found in multiple species
including plants, worms, ﬂies, and mammals.2 despite
the conservation of
there must be
changes in the regulation of autophagy among different phyla,
as it is involved in various cellular processes in multicellular
animals.
in addition to its fundamental role in starvation
survival, autophagy is thought to be involved in cell death,
neurodegeneration diseases, aging, immunity, growth, and
cancer.1,3,4
the sequestered material
the core mechanism,
in drosophila and other
insects undergoing complete
metamorphosis, the larval fat body acts as a store of proteins
and other materials, which are released through autophagy to
provide energy and nutrients during metamorphosis and early
adulthood.5–8 the fat body, an analog of the human liver, is a
polytenic tissue that grows in mass approximately 200-fold in
feeding drosophila larvae during the larval stages. after
reaching an optimal mass, mature larvae stop eating and
wander away from the food to ﬁnd a suitable place for
pupariation. at this time, the fat body undergoes a massive
induction of autophagy, known as developmental autophagy.
these changes are induced by the insect molting hormone
ecdysone at a low concentration of juvenile hormone.9 recent
results showed that ecdysone induces autophagy through
downregulation of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (pi3k)
signaling.10
a central regulator of cell growth and autophagy is target of
rapamycin (tor) kinase. inhibition of tor activity rapidly results
in growth arrest and induction of autophagy, which involves
multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.11–13
in yeast, the phosphorylation state of a number of atg proteins
is rapamycin-sensitive, and the activity of the kinase atg1 is
regulated by tor signaling.14 another regulatory mechanism
is the induction of genes necessary for autophagy, or
repression of genes that normally inhibit the process. it is
known that the gene encoding atg8, a ubiquitin-like coat
protein for autophagosomes, is upregulated in starved yeast
cells15 and drosophila larvae.16
to search for genes regulated during developmental
autophagy, we carried out a microarray analysis by comparing
the transcriptional proﬁles of fat bodies dissected from feeding
and wandering third instar larvae. this analysis both demon-
strated evolutionary conservation and identiﬁed additional
genes with previously unknown roles in autophagy. further

fkbp39 inhibits autophagy
g juha´sz et al
characterization of a selected subset of genes in transgenic
animals identiﬁed fk506-binding protein of 39 kda (fkbp39)
as an inhibitor of autophagy, which effect is likely mediated
through modulation of the transcription factor foxo.

transmembrane protein, also strongly decreased (table 2).
results
microarray analysis of transcriptional changes during
developmental autophagy. to assess gene expression
changes during developmental autophagy in drosophila
larvae, we manually dissected fat bodies before and after
the developmental induction of autophagy from feeding (60 h
after hatching from the egg, figure 1a) and wandering (84 h
after hatching from the egg, figure1b and e) larvae.6,7
samples were processed and cdnas were hybridized
to a microarray containing 3200 annotated drosophila
cdnas.17 about 1941 of
the 3200 genes investigated
were expressed in the fat body. table 1 shows the 57
genes induced by 1.65-fold or greater (estimated p-value
o0.025) during autophagy. the mrna level of
the eye
pigment biosynthesis gene hn was increased, consistent
with the known role of the fat body in that process during
the wandering stage.18 a gene encoding fbp2, a storage
protein, was also induced; together these results provide a
control for the proper developmental timing of our sample
collection. genes encoding putative lysosomal hydrolases
(a-est2, cathd, cg5932, cg1827, cg10992, cg1774)
were upregulated, consistent with the expansion of
the
lysosomal compartment during autophagy. ten of the 16 ﬂy
atg gene homologs were represented on our chip, and only
cg32672/atg8a was induced signiﬁcantly,
in accordance
with yeast and previous ﬂy data.1,16 a gene encoding another
ubiquitin-like protein of unknown function (cg7224) was also
upregulated.
the expression of 39 genes was signiﬁcantly downregu-
lated. among them, two main subgroups could be identiﬁed:
genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (cg17896, cg9140,
nd42, cg6459, trap1, cg10664, hsc70-5, cg2249,
quantitation of expressional changes for a selected
subset of genes. a subset of genes potentially involved in
autophagy was selected for further analysis by quantitative
real-time polymerase-chain reaction (qrt-pcr) to conﬁrm
and more precisely quantitate the changes in mrna
expression levels. we also analyzed expression of a few
genes not represented on our chip, including tor, cg12334/
atg8b, and cg15283, which encodes a ubiquitin-like protein
highly similar to cg7224.
as shown in table 3, these data well correlated with the
results of the microarray analysis, and further conﬁrmed the
strong upregulation of both atg8 homologs (cg32672/atg8a:
6.96 and cg12334/atg8b: 3.53 ) and cathepsin d
(cg1548: 2.14 ), a well-known lysosomal hydrolase. the
two ubiquitin-related genes we tested were also induced
(cg7224: 3.73 and cg15283: 4.62 ). tor mrna level did
not change, whereas genes encoding the cellular chaperones
fkbp39,19 cg8286/dipk,20 and baldspot21 were strongly
repressed (fkbp39: 6.73 , cg8286/dipk: 4.92 , and
baldspot: 9.91 repression).
analysis of candidate autophagy-related genes in
transgenic animals identiﬁed fkbp39 as an inhibitor of
autophagy. to establish the role of selected genes
regulated in autophagy, we carried out overexpression
studies using the gal4-uas system. overexpression of
most genes we tested (cathd, atg8a, baldspot, and dipk)
produced various phenotypes with different gal4 drivers
(supplementary table 1), but neither induced nor inhibited
autophagy (not shown).
in contrast to these results, fat body-speciﬁc overexpres-
sion of fkbp39, a peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase
(ppiase) had a dramatic effect on developmental autophagy.
figure 1 overexpression of fkbp39 inhibits developmental and starvation-induced autophagy, whereas loss of fkbp39 function leads to higher than wild-type induction
of autophagy. (a–c) lysotracker staining of fat bodies. no lysotracker staining is seen in feeding early third instar larvae (a), whereas lysotracker-positive granules (shown in
red) accumulate in fat body cells of wandering late third instars (b). overexpression of fkbp39 in the fat body inhibits the formation of lysotracker-positive granules (c), and
leads to an inhibition of cell growth. this effect is best seen by cortical actin staining (red) of fat bodies clonally overexpressing fkbp39, marked by co-overexpression of
nuclear gfp (green) (d, top panel). lower panel shows dna staining. note that the nuclei of fkbp39-overexpressing cells (green arrows) are of the same size but contain less
dna than surrounding wild-type cells (blue arrows). (e and f) electron microscopic images show fat body cells of late third instar larvae. developmental autophagy results in
the accumulation of large autolysosomes in wild-type larvae (arrow in e; cytoplasmic dark blue granules in the inset), whereas only small autolysosomes are seen in fkbp39-
overexpressing fat body cells of the same age (arrows in f). note the greatly enlarged nucleolus (asterisk) in the nucleus (n) in f, also caused by the overexpression of fkbp39.
insets show toluidine blue staining of semi-thick sections. again, note the greatly enlarged nucleoli (dark blue) in nuclei (arrowheads) in (f). (g) quantitation of lysotracker data
on developmental autophagy is shown. asterisk marks a signiﬁcant change (po0.001). (h–j) lysotracker staining of fat bodies. autophagy in fat body cells of early third instar
larvae, induced by a 4-h starvation (h, compare to a). fat body-speciﬁc overexpression of fkbp39 also blocks this starvation response (i). co-overexpression of pten
restores autophagy inhibited by fkbp39 (j). (k) quantitation of lysotracker data is shown. asterisk and double asterisks mark signiﬁcant differences (po0.001 for columns 1-
2, 2-3, 1-3). (l) rt-pcr of fat body samples dissected from control feeding larvae (lane 1), fkbp395-ha 2440 mutants (lane 2), and a precise excision line fkbp39exa3 (lane 3).
fkbp39 expression is reduced in larval fat bodies of the mutants, but precise excision of the p-element restores wild-type mrna expression (top panel). bottom panel shows
rt-pcr for actin as a control. (m–o) lysotracker staining of fat bodies. short, 80-min starvation induces higher levels of autophagy in fat bodies of fkbp395-ha 2440 mutant
larvae than in wild-type controls (n, compare with m). starvation response is restored to wild-type levels in the precise excision line fkbp39exa3 (o). (p) quantitation of the
results is shown. asterisk marks a signiﬁcant change (p¼ 0.006 for columns 1 and 2, po0.001 for columns 2 and 3, p¼ 0.27 for columns 1–3). panels a–d, h–j and m–o are
of the same magniﬁcation ( 200). panels e and f are of the same magniﬁcation and bars equal 1 mm for electron microscopical images, 10 mm for insets. error bars represent
standard deviation in panels g, k and p. genotypes: uasfkbp39/þ (a, b, e, h), cggal4/uasfkbp39 (c, f, i), hsflp; uasfkbp39/þ ; act4cd24gal4, uasgfpnls/þ

listed as in flybase (21); second column shows fold induction relative to early third instars (before the onset of autophagy); and third column shows the function, family

very few autolysosomes were observed in fat body cells of
wandering larvae overexpressing fkbp39, and these were
also smaller than in wild-type animals (figure 1c, f and g).
interestingly, fkbp39 overexpression also inhibited cell
growth. the average size of fat body cells overexpressing
fkbp39 was 43721% of wild-type neighboring cells
(figure 1d). the overexpressing cells also had a lower dna
content, suggesting a delay in endoreduplication. the fact that
nuclei were about the same size as nuclei of wild-type cells is
probably owing to the greatly enlarged nucleolus (figure 1d
and f).
we next tested if overexpression of fkbp39 had an effect
on starvation-induced autophagy. starving feeding larvae for
4 h in sucrose solution results in strong accumulation of
lysotracker-positive autolysosomes in larval fat body cells13

inhibited the induction of autophagy in starved animals (figure
1i and k), similar to the case of developmental autophagy.
as a ﬁnal veriﬁcation, we then tested how loss of fkbp39
function inﬂuences autophagy using the hypomorphic mutant
lines fkbp395-ha 2440 and fkbp395-ha 2590, isolated in the
drosdel project.22 both lines harbor a p-element insertion 49
nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon, in the 50
non-translated region of fkbp39.21 as expected from the
insertion data, these two mutant lines behaved indistinguish-
able in all of our tests, therefore only data on fkbp395-ha 2440
is shown here (see supplementary figure 1 for data on
fkbp395-ha 2590 ). mutant larvae exhibited a strong reduction
of fkbp39 expression, as analyzed by reverse transcription-
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in dissected larval fat
bodies (figure 1l) and in whole adult ﬂies (supplementary
figure 1a). the mutants are viable and fertile, and show no
obvious developmental abnormality or delay. although we
were unable to observe ectopic induction of autophagy in
different larval tissues of these animals (not shown), we found
that mutant larvae displayed a signiﬁcantly higher level of
autophagy than wild-type controls in response to a short, 80-
min starvation (figure 1m, n and p). precise excision of the p-
element (fkbp39exa3) restored wild-type mrna levels in
larval
fat bodies (figure 1l) and in whole adult ﬂies
(supplementary figure 1a), and reverted the autophagy
phenotype seen in the mutants (figure 1o).

in fkbp39-overexpressing fat bodies, as
analyzed by lysotracker staining (not shown). as ras
signaling was suggested to be involved in the induction of
autophagy in other systems, and fkbp39 inhibited the ras-
mediated activation of mapk (supplementary figure 2a), we
analyzed autophagy by generating loss of function somatic
clones of a ras null mutation in the fat body. although
slightly smaller than surrounding wild-type cells, these cells
showed normal
induction of developmental autophagy
(supplementary figure 2b), proving that ras itself is not
required for autophagy in this tissue.
in contrast to the above results, overexpression of pten,
a phosphatase that antagonizes class i pi3k signaling,
partially restored starvation-induced autophagy in fkbp39-
expressing fat body cells (figure 1j and k). unfortunately, we
could not test developmental autophagy in this case, as
simultaneous expression of these two genes in the fat body
led to a prolonged third instar stage and ultimately lethality,
potentially owing to the cumulative growth-inhibiting effects of
the two proteins.
the autophagy-inhibiting effect of fkbp39 is likely
mediated by inhibition of foxo, a novel regulator of
autophagy. the above results suggested that fkbp39 may
inhibit autophagy through activation of pi3k, a potent
inhibitor of both starvation-induced and developmental
autophagy.10,13 to test this, we analyzed the level of pi3k
signaling in fkbp39-overexpressing clones. gfp-pleckstrin
homology (ph) domain fusion proteins are well-established
markers of pi3k activity.25 in cells with high levels of
pi3k activity, accumulation of
the membrane lipid phos-
phatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate results in localization of the
gfp-ph marker
to the cell membrane. we found that
fkbp39 overexpression led to a reduction of membrane
versus cytoplasmic ratio of
the signal compared to
surrounding wild-type cells (figure 2a). this result indicates
that pi3k activity is reduced in fkbp39-overexpressing cells,
thus discounting the possibility that fkbp39 inhibits
autophagy by upregulating pi3k signaling.
as another potential measure of pi3k signaling, we also
examined the localization of the transcription factor foxo in
fkbp39 overexpressing clones. elevated pi3k signaling
results in phosphorylation of foxo by the serine/threonine
kinase akt.26 in response to this phosphorylation event, foxo
changes its intracellular localization: the nuclear pool translo-
cates to the cytoplasm.26 wild-type mid-third instar
fat
body cells displayed a moderate level of nuclear foxo.
figure 2 the autophagy-inhibiting effect of fkbp39 overexpression is potentially mediated by inhibition of foxo. (a) the membrane localization of a probe used as an
indicator of pi3k activity (gfp-ph, green) is greatly reduced compared to the cytoplasmic signal in fat body cells of feeding larvae that clonally overexpress fkbp39 (marked
by punctate myrrfp expression, red). (a0) shows the green channel separately. (b) foxo staining (red) in fat bodies of wild-type mid-third instar larvae shows both nuclear and
cytoplasmic labeling. in cells overexpressing fkbp39 (and gfp, green), the nuclear pool of foxo is completely abolished, and only cytoplasmic signal is seen. (b0) shows the
red channel separately. (c) null mutation of foxo (foxo21/foxo25) strongly decreases starvation-induced autophagy in the larval fat body, as shown by lysotracker staining
(red) (compare to figure 1h). (d) overexpression of fkbp39 in a foxo null mutant background results in a reduction similar to that seen in case of foxo mutation or fkbp39
overexpression alone, also shown by quantitation of lysotracker data in panel e. asterisks mark signiﬁcant changes (po0.001 for columns 1–2, 1–3, 1–4, p40.2 for columns

fkbp39 inhibits autophagy
g juha´sz et al
1187
overexpression of fkbp39 led to nearly complete exclusion
of foxo from the nucleus (figure 2b), despite the reduced
level of pi3k signaling in these cells, suggesting that the
autophagy-inhibiting effect of fkbp39 may be mediated
through inhibition of foxo.
to test this hypothesis, we carried out overexpression of
fkbp39 in a foxo null mutant background. null mutation of
foxo alone strongly interfered with starvation-induced autop-
hagy, indicating for the ﬁrst time a role for foxo in this process
(figure 2c and e). overexpression of fkbp39 in a foxo null
mutant background failed to further suppress autophagy
compared to mutation of foxo or overexpression of fkbp39
alone (figure 2d and e), suggesting that the autophagy-
inhibiting effect of fkbp39 is at least partly mediated by
inhibition of foxo.
further conﬁrming the important
finally, we also expressed an activated version of foxo
(foxot)26 in fat body cells of feeding larvae. we found that
foxot expression was sufﬁcient to strongly induce autop-
hagy,
role of foxo in
regulating autophagy (figure 2f). together, our
results
indicate that foxo is necessary and sufﬁcient for proper
induction of autophagy, and they identify foxo as a relevant
target of fkbp39 action.
discussion
we have used microarrays to identify genes that are regulated
at the time of developmental autophagy in the larval fat body.
upregulated genes whose protein products likely function in
developmental autophagy included various lysosomal hydro-
lases like cathepsin d and cathepsin b, and the ubiquitin-like
coat proteins for autophagosomes, atg8a and atg8b. expan-
sion of the lysosomal system is usually observed during
autophagy, and the upregulation of hydrolase genes is
consistent with the demand for increased degrading capacity
during massive induction of autophagy. of the ﬂy homologs of
yeast autophagy genes, atg8a and atg8b showed induction,
similarly to starved yeast cells or drosophila larvae.1,16 genes
of two additional small ubiquitin-like proteins, cg7224 and
cg15283, were also strongly upregulated. although the
potential role of these genes in autophagy requires further
studies, it is interesting to note that they share a strongly
conserved human homolog, loc135154.
genes encoding various mitochondrial proteins were
downregulated, which is consistent with the observation that
a large number of mitochondria are degraded during devel-
opmental autophagy.5–7 mrna levels of many cellular
chaperones also decreased, as reported earlier (see below).
gene expression proﬁling analyses under a variety of
experimental conditions or developmental transitions in which
induction of autophagy is observed have been reported
previously.16,27,28 although it is impossible to isolate autop-
hagy from the numerous other cellular processes with which
cells respond to environmental or developmental conditions
that also induce autophagy, careful comparison of our results
and the results from these studies enabled us to identify the
most promising candidate genes that may play a common role
during autophagy. of
the genes we identiﬁed as being
induced during developmental autophagy in the larval fat
body, several were previously found to be also upregulated in
response to sucrose or no-sugar starvation, conditions that
provoke a strong autophagic response in most polyploid
larval tissues. these included cg7224, cg15309, cg13603,
paip2, atg8a and cg10992/cathepsin b.16 moreover, all but
one of these genes were also identiﬁed as upregulated during
salivary gland cell death that likely involves autophagy.27,28
the expression of atg8, the coat protein for autophagosomes,
which was identiﬁed as a rate-limiting factor for the main
pathway of autophagy in yeast,15 showed only a slight
induction in these studies. it may suggest that apart from
the main pathway of autophagy, other forms of lysosomal
degradation are potentially involved in salivary gland cell
death. in fact, studies of drosophila null mutants for dark, the
ﬂy homolog of
that
autophagy is not affected in mutant salivary glands that fail to
undergo histolysis,29 similar to hypomorphic hid mutants or to
ﬂies overexpressing the caspase inhibitor p35.30
the apoptosis gene apaf-1, suggest
the expression of
the genes nop56, cg8286/dipk,
cg4164/hsp40, cg6459, hsc70-5, cg3902, his2av and
fkbp39 was also reduced both during developmental
autophagy and in response to sucrose or no-sugar
starvation.16 three of these, cg8286/dipk, cg4164/hsp40
and hsc70-5 were also downregulated in dying salivary
glands.27,28
in this work, we chose three downregulated genes for
detailed analysis. overexpression of dipk, a cellular chaper-
one, and baldspot, a transmembrane protein, did not inhibit
autophagy in our tests. however, it is important to note that
overexpression of atg8a or cathd had no effect on autophagy
either, despite their well-established role during autophagy.
indeed, the hypomorphic baldspot mutation l(3)02281 results
in darker than usual body color.21 as pigment granules are
lysosome-related organelles, it may suggest that baldspot
normally inhibits the biogenesis of these pigment granules,
and its mutation results in generation of more granules.
cg8286/dipk is a cellular chaperone containing a heat
shock protein dnaj domain, a tetratricopeptide repeat that
mediates protein–protein interactions, and a protein prenyl-
transferase domain. the human ortholog of dipk is the 58 kda
inhibitor of protein kinases (p58ipk), which strongly inhibits
eif2alpha protein kinases pkr and perk.31,32 these
kinases function in mediating various stress signals such as
the presence of double-stranded rna viruses,
interferon
gamma, endoplasmic reticulum stress or starvation.33,34
p58ipk was shown to inhibit virus- or tnfa-induced cell
death by both eif2alpha kinase-dependent and independent
mechanisms.35 the yeast eif2alpha kinase gcn2 is required
for starvation-induced autophagy, and pkr null or non-
phosphorylatable eif2alpha mutant murine embryonic ﬁbro-
blasts are defective in virus-induced autophagy.36 in our
system, overexpression of dipk did not
interfere with
autophagy, suggesting that eif2alpha kinase signaling is
not the major pathway functioning during this process in
drosophila. co-overexpression of dipk partially rescued the
phenotypes caused by expression of the proapoptotic protein
reaper or the caspase dronc (g.j. unpublished), proving the
evolutionary conserved anti-apoptotic function of dipk.
fkbp39 belongs to the family of ppiases with 21 members
in drosophila.21 ppiases catalyze the isomerization of the
peptide bond between a proline and a bulky residue like
cell death and differentiation

phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. this motif is generated
through the action of proline-directed kinases,
the best
characterized examples of which are kinases downstream of
ras. fkbps are also the intracellular
the
immunosuppressive drugs rapamycin and fk506. the
fkbp12-rapamycin complex binds to tor and inhibits cell
growth and induces autophagy. physiological roles of fkbps
are diverse and not fully characterized yet, but fkbp12 is
known to bind to various receptor kinases and the phospha-
tase calcineurin and inhibit their activity. fkbp12 also binds to
er-resident calcium channels, modulating calcium release
regulation by protein kinase a and calcineurin.23
receptors of
we identiﬁed fkbp39 as a downregulated gene during
developmental autophagy in drosophila, suggesting that
fkbp39 is an inhibitor of autophagy. indeed, overexpression
of fkbp39 led to a strong inhibition of both developmental and
starvation-induced autophagy in the larval fat body, whereas
loss of fkbp39 function resulted in a higher than wild-type
induction of autophagy in response to a short starvation.
pi3k signaling is a major regulator of cell growth and
autophagy, and it was recently shown that during develop-
mental reprogramming of
the fat body preceding meta-
morphosis, ecdysone induces autophagy in part by
downregulating pi3k signaling.10 in that study, expression
of a dominant-negative ecdysone receptor inhibited develop-
mental autophagy, and co-overexpression of pten,
the
phosphatase that antagonizes pi3k activity, reversed this
effect. we identiﬁed fkbp39 as a potential physiological
inhibitor of autophagy, its overexpression causing effects
similar to inhibition of ecdysone signaling. co-overexpression
of pten also reversed the inhibitory effect of fkbp39
overexpression on autophagy. however, in a more direct test
of pi3k activity, we found that overexpression of fkbp39
decreased the membrane localization of a probe that reﬂects
pi3k activity. these results indicate that autophagy is
inhibited in fkbp39-overexpressing cells despite a reduction
in pi3k signaling. further, they suggest that the small size of
these cells may be due in part to decreased pi3k activity.
interestingly, overexpression of fkbp39 resulted in nuclear
exclusion of foxo, suggesting that fkbp39 may inhibit
autophagy through inhibition of foxo. foxo is a forkhead
family transcription factor activated by decreased pi3k or
increased stress signaling, and has been shown to be
required for growth inhibition, increased stress resistance,
and lifespan extension provoked by modulation of
these
respectively.37,38 mutation of foxo
signaling pathways,
caused a similar reduction of starvation-induced autophagy
as overexpression of fkbp39, and overexpression of
activated foxo was sufﬁcient to induce autophagy in feeding
larvae, demonstrating that foxo is indeed involved in the
regulation of autophagy. overexpression of fkbp39 in a foxo
mutant background did not signiﬁcantly decrease autophagy
compared to cells in which foxo was mutated or fkbp39 was
overexpressed alone. this result suggests that at least part of
the effect of fkbp39 overexpression on autophagy is
mediated by its inhibition of foxo, as one would expect
additive effects of autophagy inhibition in case of independent
signaling pathways. other effects caused by overexpression
of fkbp39 (enlarged nucleolus and larval-prepupal lethality)
were not affected by the foxo mutant background.
cell death and differentiation
given the known targets of ppiases, the effect of fkbp39
on foxo localization is probably indirect. in drosophila, foxo
localization and activity has been shown to be regulated
through phosphorylation by pi3k/akt and jun n-terminal
kinase (jnk) signaling.26,38 on the basis of our results, pi3k
signaling is unlikely to mediate the effects of fkbp39
overexpression on foxo localization, although it remains
possible that fkbp39 may affect akt independently of pi3k.
therefore, jnk signaling is a promising candidate for
mediating at least some of the effects of fkbp39 over-
expression,24 especially considering the strong effect of
fkbp39 overexpression on kinases downstream of ras that
are closely related to jnk family kinases. this issue clearly
warrants future studies.
in summary, we have identiﬁed numerous genes regulated
during developmental autophagy in larval drosophila fat body,
and we have shown that fkbp39, a gene downregulated
during the process, encodes a relevant physiological inhibitor
of autophagy. we have also identiﬁed foxo as a novel
regulator of autophagy, potentially mediating the inhibitory
effect of fkbp39 on autophagy.

were sequenced and injected into fruit ﬂy embryos using standard microinjection
techniques. multiple transgenic lines were established and analyzed for each
construct with similar results.
microarrays, probe preparations, hybridizations, scanning, data

ampliﬁed by a linear antisense rna ampliﬁcation method, and labeled with cy3 or
cy5 ﬂuorescent dye during reverse transcription as described previously.40 probes
were mixed, reconstituted in 12 ml hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 ssc,
0.1% sds, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm dna) and applied onto the array after
denaturation by heating for 1 min at 901c. the slide was covered and incubated at

(660 nm) (for cy5 labeling) by using a scanarray lite (gsi lumonics, uk) scanning
confocal ﬂuorescent scanner with 10 mm resolution. scanned output ﬁles were
analyzed using the genepix pro 3.0 software (axon instruments inc, foster city,

the image. the average and median pixel
intensity ratios calculated from both
