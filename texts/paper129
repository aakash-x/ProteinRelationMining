cd34+ bone marrow blasts from high-risk myelodysplas-
tic syndrome (mds) patients as well as mds patient-
derived cell
lines (p39 and molm13) constitutively
activate the nuclear factor-jb (nf-jb) pathway and
undergo apoptosis when nf-jb is inhibited. here, we
show that the combination of conventional chemothera-
peutic agents (daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, 5-azacytidine
or camptothecin) with the nf-jb inhibitor bay11-7082
did not yield a synergistic cytotoxicity. in contrast,
bay11-7082 (which targets the nf-jb-activating i-jb
kinase (ikk) complex) or knockdown of essential compo-
nents of the nf-jb system (such as the ikk1 and ikk2
subunits of the ikk complex and the p65 subunit of
nf-jb), by small interfering rnas sensitized mds cell
lines to starvation-induced apoptosis. the combination
of bay11-7082 and nutrient depletion synergistically
killed the acute myeloid leukemia (aml) cell line u937
as well as primary cd34+ bone marrow blasts from aml
and high-risk mds patients. the synergistic killing by
bay11-7082, combined with nutrient depletion, led to cell
death accompanied by all hallmarks of apoptosis, includ-
ing an early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane
potential, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-
inducing factor (aif) from mitochondria, activation of
caspase-3, phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma
membrane surface and nuclear chromatin condensation.
transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence
of numerous autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm before
cells underwent nuclear apoptosis. nonetheless, cell
death was neither inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-vad-fmk nor by knockdown of aif or of essential
components of the autophagy pathway (atg5, atg6/
beclin-1, atg10, atg12). in contrast, external supply of
glucose, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-i could retard
the cell death induced by bay11-7082 combined with
starvation. these results suggest that in mds cells,
nf-jb inhibition can precipitate a bioenergetic crisis

introduction
the molecular control of cell death constitutes a dual
conundrum for oncology. on the one hand, cancer cells
develop resistance against cell death induced by adverse
conditions such as hypoxia, acidosis, the absence of
trophic support or the presence of inhibitory factors
(hanahan and weinberg, 2000). on the other hand,
most of the weapons in the oncologist’s armamentarium
are designed to induce cancer cell death, meaning that
the acquired resistance of tumor cells against lethal
stimuli eventually seals the patient’s fate (igney and
krammer, 2002).
cell death can result from distinct processes, namely
type 1 cell death (apoptosis) and type 2 cell death
(autophagy) (kroemer et al., 2005). apoptosis is deﬁned
as cell death accompanied by a stereotyped pattern of
morphological alterations,
in particular nuclear con-
densation (pyknosis) and fragmentation (karyorhexis).
although caspases are required for the acquisition of the
full-blown apoptotic phenotype, their contribution to
lethal signaling is debated, and most dead cells that
cumulate in apoptosis are not prevented when caspase
activation is suppressed by addition of chemical caspase
inhibitors (chipuk and green, 2005; kroemer and
martin, 2005). caspase-independent death effectors,
including apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), have been
accused of mediating so-called caspase-independent cell
death (modjtahedi et al., 2006). type 2 cell death is
characterized by the accumulation of autophagic va-
cuoles in the cytoplasm surrounding a normal nucleus
(kroemer and jaattela, 2005). although there are a few
examples in which autophagy contributes to cell death
4072
nf-jb-dependent sensitization to starvation
c fabre et al
(shimizu et al., 2004; yu et al., 2004), in most cases
interventions designed to suppress autophagy do not
prevent type 2 cell death, suggesting that this death
modality occurs with, but not
through, autophagy
(kroemer and jaattela, 2005). in many paradigms,
autophagy actually constitutes a mechanism of adapta-
tion to nutrient stress (in which case autophagy allows
macromolecules to catabolize, to generate atp and
other building blocks of biogenesis) or to organelle
stress (in which damaged organelles are removed by the
autophagic machinery) (shintani and klionsky, 2004;
levine and yuan, 2005). moreover, cell death that has
initially adopted a type 2 morphology may switch to
type 1 at a late stage of the process,
in a caspase-
fashion (martin and baehrecke, 2004;
dependent
gonzalez-polo et al., 2005).
nuclear factor-kb (nf-kb) is a prominent transcrip-
tion factor that is frequently upregulated in cancer and
that inhibits cell death (karin et al., 2004; israel and
kroemer, 2006). although little is known about the
impact of nf-kb on autophagy, it is clear that nf-kb
can upregulate a plethora of apoptosis-inhibitory gene
products. recently, we have found that nf-kb may
play an important role in the switch of myelodysplastic
syndrome (mds) from a pre-neoplastic to a neoplastic
condition. indeed, low-risk mds is characterized by the
expansion of mutated hematopoietic stem cells (which
are cd34 þ) in the bone marrow that fail to differentiate
correctly and rather undergo premature apoptosis
(fenaux, 2005). these low-risk mds cd34 þ bone
marrow cells show no signs of nf-kb activation.
however, cd34 þ bone marrow cells from high-risk
mds (which eventually transform into acute myeloid
leukemia (aml)), combine a blockage in differentiation
with a resistance against apoptosis. such high-risk
mds cd34 þ bone marrow cells not only exhibit a

constitutive nf-kb activation but, moreover, critically
depend on this nf-kb activation, as demonstrated by
the fact
its inhibition causes their immediate
apoptosis (carvalho et al., 2006; braun et al., 2006b).
very similar data have been reported on aml,
irrespective of the etiology of the disease (which may
be primary, post-mds or secondary to chemotherapy of
other malignancies). cd34 þ cells from aml patients
exhibit constitutive nf-kb activation and die when
nf-kb is inhibited (guzman et al., 2001; birkenkamp
et al., 2004).
the nf-kb pathway can be targeted indirectly by
agents that inhibit the proteasome (such as bortezomib)
(mani and gelmann, 2005; rajkumar et al., 2005) and
that increase the cytosolic concentration of the inhibitor
of nf-kb (i-kb), or more speciﬁcally by antagonists of
the nf-kb activating kinase complex (the so-called i-kb
kinase, ikk) (karin et al., 2004). using a speciﬁc
inhibitor of ikk, bay11-7082, we addressed the
question as to whether nf-kb inhibition may be
used to sensitize mds cells to cell death induction.
nf-jb-dependent sensitization to starvation
c fabre et al
as shown here, bay11-7082 enhances cell death of
mds cells that are depleted from nutrients, and this cell
death pathway exhibits characteristics of type 1 and type
2 cell death.

nf-jb-dependent sensitization to starvation
c fabre et al
bay11-7082 had little effect on the survival of the p39
population (causing b30% of cell death at 5 mm), and
starvation did not compromise the survival of p39 cells
at all. however, the combination of bay11-7082 and
starvation killed most, if not all, p39 cells, exhibiting a
clear synergism. this synergistic cytotoxic effect was
observed using three different experimental criteria,
namely dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (dcm measured by staining with diaminidino-
2-phenylindole (dioc6(3)), figure 1a and b), exposure
of phosphatidylserine residues on the plasma membrane
(detected by staining with annexin v-ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (fitc) conjugates, figure 2a and b)
or plasma membrane permeabilization (measured by
staining with the vital dye propidium iodide (pi);
figures 1 and 2). the cooperative killing by bay11-
7082 and starvation was observed for another mds/
line (molm13, figure 3), as well as for
aml cell
the aml cell
line u937 (see below), and was not
affected by addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-val-
ala-aza-ﬂuoromethylketone (z-vad-fmk) (figures 1–3),
indicating that it occurred in a caspase-independent
fashion. however, cell death induced by the combina-
tion of bay11-7082 and starvation exhibited typical
features of apoptosis (kroemer et al., 2005) with
advanced chromatin condensation and karyorhexis,
as determined by transmission electron microscopy
(figure 4a). in spite of the fact that z-vad-fmk pre-
vented full-blown chromatin condensation (figure 4b),
it failed to preserve the plasma membrane integrity of
cells succumbing to the combination of bay11-7082
plus starvation (figures 1–3). this indicates that the
apoptotic morphology depended on caspase activation,
whereas cell death occurred in a caspase-independent
fashion. the combination of bay11-7082 and nutrient
depletion also exerted synergistic cytotoxic effects on
primary cd34 þ bone marrow cells from high-risk mds
and aml patients, yet had much less effects on cd34 þ
bone marrow cells from control patients, as exempliﬁed

in figure 5. again, this combined cytotoxic effect was
not inhibited by z-vad-fmk (figure 5).
in view of the possibility that the kinase inhibitor
bay11-7082 might exert nonspeciﬁc or off-target
effects, we performed a series of experiments in which
the nf-kb system was inhibited by small interfering
rnas (sirnas) targeting the nf-kb subunit p65 or the
catalytic subunit of the ikk complex, ikk1 and/or
ikk2. shortly (24 h) after transfection with these
sirnas (but not with a sirna that
targets the
functionally irrelevant emerin mrna), p39 cells were
more susceptible to starvation-induced death than
control cells (note the effect on the delta between
culture in rich medium versus starvation for the different
transfectants in figure 6a). however, inhibition of the
nf-kb pathway killed p39 cells alone, especially at later
(48 h) time points (figure 6b), in line with our published
results (braun et al., 2006a).

and were analyzed 24 (a) or 48 h (b) post-transfection. twelve

and analyzed by cytoﬂuorometry. mean results of

braun et al., 2006b). therefore, we investigated the
possibility of sensitizing p39 cells to chemotherapeutic
agents by inhibiting ikk with bay11-7082. p39 cells
were
incubated with increasing concentrations of
daunorubicin, mitoxantrone (figure 7a), 5-azacytidine
or camptothecin (figure 7b), alone or in combination
with 5 mm bay11-7082. this dose of bay11-7082
strongly sensitized to starvation-induced apoptosis in
parallel experiments (figures 1–3), and was sufﬁcient to
kill 20–40% of the cells (figure 7a and b). however,
there was no synergism between chemotherapy and ikk
inhibition at any of the time points investigated (6–48 h).
thus, the cooperative killing effect for nf-kb inhibition
plus starvation (figures 1–6) is unique thus far in that
it cannot be extrapolated to standard chemotherapy
regimens.
oncogene
mechanisms of starvation-induced death of
nf-kb-inhibited cells
to obtain some mechanistic insights into the synergistic
killing induced by bay11-7082 plus starvation, we
investigated the culture conditions required for this
effect. addition of
fetal calf serum (fcs) greatly
attenuated the effect of the otherwise lethal combination
(bay11-7082 plus starvation). this death-inhibitory
effect of fcs was further enhanced by addition of
insulin-like growth factor-i and insulin. this result was
obtained both in p39 mds cells (figure 8a) and in u937
aml cells (figure 8b). these data suggest that the
absence of trophic factors is co-responsible for cell death
induction by starvation plus bay11-7082. we also
wondered whether the absence of energy supply might
seal the cell’s fate in this system, in particular because
dialysed serum lost its capacity to antagonize the lethal
effects of bay11-7082 (not shown). supplementation of
cultures maintained in bay11-7082 plus earle’s ba-
lanced salt solution (ebss) (starvation medium) with
glucose partially reduced cell killing.
in contrast,
supplementation with high doses (5 mm) of pyruvate
or methylpyruvate (a plasma membrane-permeable
pyruvate derivative) had little,
if any, cytoprotective
effect on the system (figure 8c). these data suggest that
a combination of energy depletion and lack of trophic
factors account for the cytocidal activity of starvation
plus bay11-7082. as energy depletion is counteracted
by autophagy (which allows for the catabolic generation
of atp), we investigated the impact of starvation, alone
or together with bay11-7082, on autophagy in p39
cells. in this cell line, transfection with the gfp-lc3
chimera (mizushima et al., 2004) was lethal (not shown),
meaning that we had to rely on electron microscopy to
quantify autophagic vacuolization. as expected, starva-
tion alone induced autophagic vacuolization, whereas
bay11-7082 had little or no effect on autophagy.
however, the combination of starvation and bay11-
7082 induced accelerated autophagic vacuolization,
inducing the presence of both immature and mature
autophagic vesicles (figure 9). this enhanced autopha-
gic vacuolization was observed in cells that bear non-
apoptotic nuclei (figure 9a). in contrast, when cells
acquire the apoptotic morphology, they are devoid of
autophagic vacuoles, perhaps as a result of general
cytoplasmic shrinkage (see above, figure 4a).
cell death induced by the combination of bay11-
7082 plus starvation was accompanied by the activation
of caspase-3, because a fraction of the cells stained
positively with an antibody that recognizes active
caspase-3 (figure 10). however, cell death proceeded
in a caspase-independent fashion (figures 1–3). we,

cell death process. the mitochondrial intermembrane

figure 7 failure of bay11-7082 to sensitize to cell death induction by cytotoxic agents. p39 cells were cultured in the presence of the
indicated cytotoxic agents, namely daunorubicin, mitoxantrone (a), 5-azacytidine or camptothecin (b) in the absence or presence of
5 mm bay11-7082. after 12 h of culture, p39 cells were stained with an annexin v–fitc conjugate plus dapi to determine the

panels, figure 10b), meaning that
they had been
released from mitochondria. thus, mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (figure 10) and loss of the
dcm (figure 1) accompany cell death induced by
starvation plus bay11-7082.
next, we determined whether
the inhibition of
autophagy by targeting essential autophagy genes
(atg6/beclin-1, atg5, atg10, atg12) with small
interfering rnas (sirna) would reduce cell killing by
bay11-7082 plus starvation. transfection of cells with
sirnas that inhibit autophagy (boya et al., 2005;
gonzalez-polo et al., 2005; lum et al., 2005) and the
depletion of essential atg proteins (as shown for
atg6/beclin-1, figure 11a) had no protective effect on
cell death induction by bay11-7082 plus starvation,
even in the presence of z-vad-fmk (figure 11b).
similarly, the knockdown of aif (figure 12a) failed
to abolish cell killing induced by bay11-7082 plus
starvation (figure 12b). these data suggest that cell
induced by nf-kb inhibition plus starvation,
death,
cannot be explained by one single effector mechanism
(such as aif and/or caspase activation) and that it does
not result from autophagy.
concluding remarks
mds continues
to constitute a medical problem,
especially for the aging population, with an incidence
of >50/100 000 among individuals over 70 years.
unfortunately, there is no cure for mds apart from
allotransplantation, which is not a feasible therapeutic
option in this age group, and the search for therapeutic
agents is still in progress. the lack of synergistic death-
inducing effects in mds cell lines suggest that it would
not be of advantage to combine chemotherapeutic
agents that are already used in the treatment of mds
with nf-kb inhibitors (figure 7). such inhibitors might,
however, be used in monotherapy, and the results
contained in this paper give some insights into the
death-inducing action of nf-kb inhibitors. starvation
from nutrients sensitized mds cells to the induction of
apoptosis by nf-kb inhibitors such as bay11-7082
(figures 1–5) or sirna-mediated depletion of ikk1,
ikk2 or p65 (figure 6). this cell death was apoptotic
because it displayed chromatin condensation (figure 4)
as well as biochemical changes that classically accom-
pany apoptosis (dcm dissipation in figures 1 and 3),

figure 8 action of nutrients and serum factors on the bay11-

p39 cells were cultured for 12 h in the presence of the indicated
combinations of agents, namely bay11-7082 (5 mm), igf-i (10 ng/
ml), insulin (500 ng/ml) and/or fcs (10%), complete medium or
starvation medium. (b) u937 aml cells were cultured as in (a)
with the sole difference that the experiment was stopped at 24 h
rather than at 12 h. (c) p39 cells were cultured in the presence of
bay11-7082 (5 mm), glucose (5 mm), pyruvate (5 mm) and methyl-
pyruvate (5 mm). cells were stained with fitc–labeled annexin v
(a–c) and pi (a–c) to determine the percentage of dying and dead
cells by cytoﬂuorometry. the indicated parameters of cell death
were measured in triplicate.
(figure 12) did not prevent cell death induction by
bay11-7082 plus starvation.
the combination of starvation and ikk inhibition by
bay11-7082 produced an atypical result, namely the
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (figure 9). this
accumulation was clearly seen before the cells mani-
fested the ultrastructural features of apoptosis (figure 9,
figure 4). a similar phenomenon, namely accumulation
of autophagic vacuoles before the onset of apoptosis,
has been described in other systems, particularly in cell
death induction systems such as the salivary gland of
the developing drosophila melanogaster (martin and
baehrecke, 2004; akdemir et al., 2006) or the death of
lamp2-deﬁcient human cancer cells and mouse ﬁbro-
blasts (gonzalez-polo et al., 2005). however, autophagy
did not contribute to cell death because depletion of
proteins that are essential for autophagy such as atg5,
atg6/beclin-1, atg10 or atg12 did not prevent
cell death induced by bay11-7082 plus starvation
(figure 11). these results indicate that autophagy is
not required for the induction of apoptosis and cell
death in this system, in line with the general notion that
autophagy is a stress response designed to maintain
cellular homeostasis (and,
in particular, atp levels)
in conditions of nutrient stress (boya et al., 2005;
gonzalez-polo et al., 2005; kroemer and jaattela, 2005;
levine and yuan, 2005; lum et al., 2005). apparently,
inhibition of nf-kb did not prevent autophagic
vacuolization but rather enhanced this phenomenon
(figure 9), perhaps correlating with enhanced energetic
demands or expenditure. glucose and agents that
enhance glucose transport (such as insulin and insulin-
like growth factor) protect against cell death induced in
these conditions,
idea that
cellular bioenergetics determine the elevated autophagic
response and subsequent cell death. to our knowledge,
this is the ﬁst time that nf-kb is involved in the
regulation of energy metabolism. future studies must
address this link as well as its putative implication
in mds.
in line with the general
materials and methods
primary bone marrow cells
the diagnosis of mds and aml was based on peripheral
blood counts, as well as cytology of peripheral blood and bone
marrow, according to the who classiﬁcation. bone marrow
aspirates were obtained after informed consent using syringes
containing media supplemented with ethylenediaminetetraace-
tic acid. the mononuclear cell fraction was isolated by density
gradient centrifugation using ficoll-paque plus (amersham
biosciences, sunnyvale, ca, usa). cd34 þ cells were then
isolated by positive selection with the minimacss system
