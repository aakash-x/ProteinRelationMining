telomere 3ⴕ overhang-speciﬁc dna oli-
abstract
gonucleotides (t-oligos) induce cell death in cancer
cells, presumably by mimicking telomere loop disrup-
tion. therefore, t-oligos are considered an exciting
new therapeutic strategy. the purpose of this study was
to elucidate how t-oligos exert antitumor effects on
human malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. we
demonstrated that t-oligos inhibited the proliferation
of malignant glioma cells through induction of non-
apoptotic cell death and mitochondria hyperpolariza-
tion, whereas normal astrocytes were resistant to t-
oligos. tumor cells treated with t-oligos developed
features compatible with autophagy, with development
of autophagic vacuoles and conversion of an autoph-
agy-related protein, microtubule-associated protein 1
light chain 3 from type i (cytoplasmic form) to type ii
(membrane form of autophagic vacuoles). a reverse-
phase protein microarray analysis and western blotting
revealed that treatment with t-oligos inhibited the
mammalian target of the rapamycin (mtor) and the
signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3
(stat3). moreover, pretreatment with t-oligos signif-
icantly prolonged the survival time of mice inoculated
intracranially with malignant glioma cells compared
with that of untreated mice and those treated with
control oligonucleotides (pⴝ0.0065 and pⴝ0.043, re-
spectively). these results indicate that t-oligos stimu-
late the induction of nonapoptotic autophagic also
known as type ii programmed cell death and are thus
promising in the treatment of malignant glioma.—aoki,

malignant gliomas are the most common primary
brain tumors in adults. the disease has one of the worst
prognoses of all cancers, with a median survival of 12
months despite remarkable advances in surgery, radio-
therapy, and chemotherapy (1, 2). thus, novel treat-
ment strategies for malignant gliomas are needed.
telomeres are tandem repeats of a speciﬁc 5⬘-
ttaggg-3⬘ nucleotide sequence at the ends of chro-
mosomes (3, 4). telomerase, a ribonucleic acid-protein
complex, adds telomeric repeats to the ends of telo-
meres to compensate for the progressive loss (5, 6).
the essential role of telomeres in protecting chromo-
some ends from fusion or from being recognized as
dna damage is mediated by a cap of telomere-associ-
ated proteins [telomere repeat factors 1 and 2 (trf1
and 2) (7–9)]. the 3⬘ end of each telomere consists of
a single-stranded g-rich overhang that inserts into the
proximal double-stranded telomere and stabilizes a
loop structure at the chromosome ends (8).
when the telomere loop structure is disrupted by
expression of dominant-negative trf2, the telomere 3⬘
overhang is exposed and degraded, and cell death is
triggered in certain cell types (9). exposure of the
telomere 3⬘ overhang due to the opening of the normal
telomere loop structure may be a physiological signal
inducing dna damage responses. therefore, dna
oligonucleotides homologous to the telomere 3⬘ over-
hang (t-oligos) may mimic this signal in the absence of
dna damage or telomere disruption. indeed, treat-
ment with t-oligos induced apoptosis in lymphocytic
leukemia (10), melanoma cells (11), and breast carci-
noma cells (unpublished data), whereas a senescent
phenotype or an early response to dna damage such as
the phosphorylation of
the histone variant h2ax,
yielding ␥-h2ax, was induced in ﬁbroblasts or ﬁbrosar-
coma cells (12–15). these observations indicate that

t-oligos may be useful
in the treatment of various
cancers. however, whether t-oligos are effective against
malignant gliomas is unknown. therefore, in this study,
we determined the effect of t-oligos on malignant
glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. treatment with t-oligos
inhibited the proliferation of malignant glioma cells,
but not normal human astrocytes (nhas), through
induction of nonapoptotic autophagy. pretreatment
with t-oligos markedly suppressed the growth of intra-
cranial tumors in nude mice. our ﬁndings provide a
strong basis for treating malignant gliomas with t-
oligos as a tumor-selective approach.
materials and methods
oligonucleotides
two dna oligonucleotides were designed as described pre-
viously (10 –15) and purchased from the midland certiﬁed
reagent company (midland, tx, usa). one was homolo-
gous to the telomere overhang [11 mer test (t)-oligo: pgt-
tagggttag], and the other was complementary to this
sequence [11 mer control (c)-oligo: pctaaccctaac]. oli-
gonucleotides were resuspended in h2o to provide a 2 mm
stock solution. for use in experiments, the stock solution was
diluted into culture medium, ﬁlter-sterilized, and added to
culture dishes. in all experiments, cells were placed in
medium containing oligonucleotides at a concentration of
10 – 80 ␮m. on the basis of previous experiments (10 –15),
this medium was added only once.
reagents
3-methyladenine (3-ma), rapamycin, ag490, and an antibody
against ␤-actin were purchased from sigma chemical (st.
louis, mo, usa). antibodies against akt, phospho-akt
(thr308 and ser473), phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3
(gsk3) (ser21/9), mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor),
phospho-mtor (ser2448), p38, phospho-p38 (thr180/
tyr182), src, phospho-src (tyr416), and phospho-signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) (ser727) were
purchased from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma,
usa). anti-gsk3 antibody was purchased from santa cruz
biotechnology (santa cruz, ca, usa). an antibody against
stat3 was purchased from upstate (charlottesville, va,
usa). an antibody against the microtubule-associated pro-
tein 1 light chain 3 (lc3) was kindly provided by dr. tamotsu
yoshimori (national institute of genetics, mishima, japan).
cell culture
human malignant glioma u87-mg and u373-mg cells were
purchased from american type culture collection (manas-
sas, va, usa). nhas were kindly provided by dr. kenneth
aldape (the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer
center, houston, tx, usa) (16). cells were cultured in
dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (invitro-
gen, carlsbad, ca), 100 u/ml penicillin (invitrogen), and 2.5
␮g/ml fungizone (invitrogen) at 37°c in 5% co2. doubling
times of u87-mg, u373-mg, and nhas were 25.5, 25.2, and
29.6 h, respectively, indicating that these cells have similar
proliferative rates in cell culture.
cell viability assay
the cytotoxic effect of t-oligos or c-oligos on cultured cells
was determined using cell proliferation reagent wst-1
(roche applied science, indianapolis, in, usa), as described
previously (17). cells were seeded at 2 ⫻ 103 cells/well in a
96-well plate and incubated at 37°c overnight. the cells were
treated with 10 – 80 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 3, 5, or 7 days
and exposed to 10 ␮l of wst-1 reagent for 1 h at 37°c. the
absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader.
the viability of cells treated with vehicle alone was considered
to be 100%.
apoptosis detection assay
to determine whether treatment with t-oligos induces apo-
ptosis, we used an annexin v-fitc apoptosis detection kit
(bd biosciences pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa), accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. at 72 h after exposure
to 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos, the cells were trypsinized and
incubated with annexin v-fitc and propidium iodide for 15
min at room temperature in the dark, followed by cytoﬂuoro-
metric analysis with a facs calibur ﬂow cytometer using
cellquest software (becton dickinson, san jose, ca, usa).
at least 10,000 cells were analyzed from each sample. to
detect apoptosis morphologically, we treated tumor cells with
10 – 80 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 3 to 7 days, ﬁxed them with
4% paraformaldehyde, and stained them with hoechst 33258
(0.5 ␮g/ml) for 15 min, as described previously (18). two
hundred cells were counted and scored for the incidence of
apoptotic chromatin changes under a ﬂuorescence micro-
scope. paclitaxel (4 nm) was used as a positive control to
induce apoptosis (19).
electron microscopy
cells were grown on glass coverslips, treated with c-oligos or
t-oligos at 40 ␮m for 72 h as described above, and ﬁxed with
a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformal-
dehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, ph 7.3, for 1 h. the
samples were postﬁxed in 1% oso4 in the same buffer for 1 h
and then subjected to electron microscopic analysis as de-
scribed previously (18). representative areas were chosen for
ultrathin sectioning and viewed with a jem 1010 transmission
electron microscope (jeol, peabody, ma, usa) at an accel-
erating voltage of 80 kv. digital images were obtained with the
amt imaging system (advanced microscopy techniques,
danvers, ma, usa).
detection and quantiﬁcation of acidic vesicular organelles
with acridine orange staining
autophagy is the process of sequestering cytoplasmic proteins
into the lytic component and is characterized by the forma-
tion and promotion of acidic vesicular organelles (avos), as
described previously (20). to detect the development of
avos, we treated cells with 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for
72 h as described above and then performed vital staining
with acridine orange as described previously (18). to quantify
the development of avos, the cells were stained with 1 ␮g/ml
acridine orange for 15 min, removed from the plate with
trypsin-edta (invitrogen), and analyzed using the facscan
ﬂow cytometer and cellquest software (becton dickinson).
assessment of the involvement of lc3
lc3, a mammalian homologue of the yeast autophagy-related
(atg) gene atg8, is recruited to the autophagosome mem-
autophagy and telomere 3⬘ overhang dna
2919
brane during autophagy (21). green ﬂuorescent protein
(gfp)-tagged lc3-expressing cells can be used to demon-
strate induction of autophagy (18, 21–23). gfp-lc3 cells
exhibit diffuse gfp ﬂuorescence under control conditions,
whereas a punctate pattern of gfp-lc3 ﬂuorescence (gfp-
lc3 dots) was observed during autophagy. therefore, using
the gfp-lc3 expression vector kindly provided by dr.
noboru mizushima (tokyo metropolitan institute of medical
science, tokyo, japan), we determined the involvement of
lc3 in cells treated with c-oligos or t-oligos. cells were
transiently transfected with the gfp-lc3 expression vector
using fugene 6 transfection reagent (roche). after being
cultured overnight, cells were treated with 40 ␮m t-oligo or
c-oligo for 72 h as described above, ﬁxed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde, and examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope.
to quantify autophagic cells after treatment, we counted the
number of autophagic cells (ⱖ5 gfp-lc3 dots per cell)
among 200 gfp-positive cells.
western blotting
soluble proteins were isolated from untreated cells and cells
treated with 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for the indicated
periods for western blotting, as described previously (18).
equal amounts of protein (40 ␮g) were separated by 10% or
15% sds-page gel (bio-rad, richmond, ca, usa) and
transferred to a hybond-p membrane (amersham, piscat-
away, nj, usa). the membranes were treated with primary
antibodies (diluted 1:1000) overnight at 4°c and incubated
for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution, amer-
sham) at room temperature for 1 h. bound antibody com-
plexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent (amersham) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions.
reverse-phase protein microarray analysis
the protein microarray was processed as described previously
(24). cells treated with 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 15, 30,
or 60 min were lysed with reverse-phase protein microarray
(rppm) lysis buffer (150 mm nacl; 50 mm hepes, ph 7.4;
1.5 mm mgcl2; 1 mm egta; 100 mm naf; 10 mm nappi;
10% glycerol; and 1% triton x-100) supplemented with
complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (roche ap-
plied science, indianapolis, in, usa). after being centri-
fuged, supernatants containing postnuclear lysates were col-
lected. samples were then denatured by the addition of one
part 4⫻ sds sample buffer (0.25 m tris ph 6.8, 35% glycerol,
8% sds, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) to three parts lysate
and boiling for 5 min. samples were serially diluted with
dilution buffer (3 parts rppm lysis buffer⫹1 part 4⫻ sds
sample buffer) and transferred to 384-well plates for spotting
onto nitrocellulose-coated fast slides (whatman, florham
park, nj, usa) using a genetac g3 arrayer (genomic
solutions, ann arbor, mi, usa). an array consisting of 4 ⫻ 4
grids (2 samples with 82-fold serial dilutions/grid) arranged
in 4 rows and 12 columns with 8 or 9 touches per spot was
programmed for printing. slides not immediately stained
were stored in desiccant at ⫺20°c.
slides were precleared by being washed in re-blot plus
mild antibody stripping solution (chemicon international,
temecula, ca, usa) for 15 min and washed with rppm
tbs-t (0.3 m nacl; 0.05 m tris, ph 7.6; and 0.1% tween-20).
slides were then blocked with 0.2% i-block (applied biosys-
tems, foster city, ca, usa) in pbs ⫹ 0.1% tween-20, either
for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4°c. after a
tbs-t rinse, slides were stained using a tyramide-based signal
ampliﬁcation assay (catalyzed signal ampliﬁcation system,
dako, carpintiria, ca, usa) and a colorimetric substrate
(diaminobenzidine). speciﬁcally, slides were further blocked
for peroxidases, avidin, biotin, and proteins (5 min per
reagent followed by 3 min. washes with rppm tbs-t) and
incubated for 45 min with the primary antibodies. after
rppm tbs-t washes, a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate
biotinylated antibody (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca,
usa) was added and incubated for 30 min. antibodies were
diluted in background-reducing antibody diluent (dako).
the slides were washed, and the three ampliﬁcation reagents
from the dako csa kit (streptavidin-biotin complex, ampliﬁ-
cation reagent, and streptavidin-hrp) were added for 15 min
each, followed by rppm tbs-t washes. for signal detection,
diaminobenzidine was added to the slides and incubated for
3–5 min; the reaction was stopped by immersing the slides in
ddh20 and then air-drying them.
for sample quantiﬁcation, slides were scanned on an hp
scanjet 8200 scanner at 600 dpi in grayscale and saved as a
16-bit tiff ﬁle. the images were analyzed using microvigene
version 2.2 (vigene tech, north billerica, ma, usa), which
contains spot-ﬁnding and curve-ﬁtting programs. protein
levels of samples were determined by converting ln (y0)
values (set at mean net and total curve mean) to linear values.
the protein phosphorylation level was standardized by the
equivalent total protein level, and each value was expressed as
an intensity showing the ratio of the standardized expression
in cells treated with c-oligos or t-oligos to that in untreated
cells.
flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial
membrane potential
to detect changes in mitochondrial membrane potential,
rhodamine 123 (molecular probe, eugene, or) was added as
described previously (18). tumor cells were treated with 40
␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 72 h, collected by trypsinization,
washed with pbs, and stained with 1 ␮m rhodamine 123 in
pbs in the dark at 37°c for 1 h. samples were washed,
resuspended in pbs, and then subjected to facscan using
cellquest software.
measurement of telomere length
u373-mg cells were treated with 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos
or diluent alone for 3 or 5 days, and genomic dna was
isolated using the dneasy tissue kit (qiagen, valencia, ca,
usa). telomere length was determined using the telo
ttaggg telomere length assay (roche) following the pro-
tocol supplied by the manufacturer. in brief, 1 ␮g of puriﬁed
genomic dna was digested with hinfi/rsai. the dna frag-
ments were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a
nylon membrane for southern blotting, hybridized to a
digoxigenin-labeled probe speciﬁc for telomeric repeats, and
incubated with antidigoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase. termi-
nal restriction fragments were detected by chemilumines-
cence. the mean telomere length (mtl) was determined by
scanning the exposed x-ray ﬁlm with a densitometer and
calculated as described previously (25).
animal studies
to determine the therapeutic efﬁcacy of t-oligos for malig-
nant gliomas, the 8- to 12-wk-old female nude mice (experi-
mental radiation oncology at m. d. anderson cancer cen-
ter; 5 or 6 mice in each treatment group) were anesthetized
with ketamine and xylazine as described previously (26). a
0.9-mm burr hole was then drilled in the mouse skulls 1.0 mm

anterior and 2.5 mm lateral to the bregma to expose the dura.
a screw guide with a 0.5-mm central hole and a stylet were
placed into the burr hole as described previously (27). three
days after the screw guide was set in the skull, a 10 ␮l syringe
(hamilton, reno, nv, usa) ﬁtted with a 26-gauge needle was
connected to a microinfusion pump (harvard apparatus,
cambridge, ma, usa). through the screw guide, at a depth
of 3.5 mm from the skull (corresponding to the region of the
caudate nucleus), 10 ␮l aliquots of 5 ⫻ 104 u87-mg cells
(untreated or pretreated with 40 ␮m t-oligos or c-oligos for
24 h in serum-free dmem) were inoculated at a rate of 1.0
␮l/min. mice were then observed until they became mori-
bund, lethargic, anorexic, dehydrated, or distressed, at which
point they were deeply anesthetized and then euthanized by
intracardiac perfusion-ﬁxation. for histological analysis, the
brains were removed, sliced coronally into ﬁve, blocks and
snap-frozen. coronal sections (8 –10 ␮m) were then made. all
animal studies were performed in the veterinary facilities of
the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center in
accordance with institutional, state, federal, and ethical reg-
ulations for experimental animal care.
statistical analysis
data are mean ⫾ sd. the signiﬁcance of the in vitro experi-
ments was determined using the student’s t test (2-tailed).
the kaplan-meier product-limit method was used to estimate
the survival curves (27). the signiﬁcance of differences in
survival time between treatment groups was assessed using
the cox-mantel log-rank test as described previously (27).
p values of ⬍0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
results
t-oligos decrease the viability of malignant glioma
cells but not nhas
to determine the cytotoxic effects of t-oligos on ma-
lignant glioma cells and their normal counterparts,
nhas, we treated two malignant glioma cell
lines
(u87-mg and u373-mg) and nhas with 40 ␮m t-
oligos or c-oligos for 3 or 5 days and assessed cell
viability using a wst-1 cell proliferation assay. as shown
in fig. 1a, treatment with t-oligos remarkably sup-
pressed the cell viability of u87-mg and u373-mg cells
compared with c-oligos (60 vs. 81% viability and 82 vs.
94% viability on day 3 and 62 vs. 94% viability and 55 vs.
97% viability on day 5, respectively). the inhibition was
signiﬁcant in u87-mg and u373-mg cells (p⬍0.001 on
days 3 and 5). in contrast, treatments with t-oligos only
slightly diminished the viability of nha cells (88 vs.
91% viability on day 3 and 80 vs. 85% viability on day 5).
the differences in cell viability were not signiﬁcant.
when u373-mg cells were treated with t-oligos at
10 – 80 ␮m for 3–7 days, the viability was reduced in
dose- and time-dependent manners (fig. 1b). treat-
ment with t-oligos at 80 ␮m for 7 days inhibited the
viability of u373-mg cells to 23% (p⬍0.001, compared
with c-oligos). these results indicate that t-oligos have
a tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxicity for malignant glioma cells.
t-oligos do not signiﬁcantly affect apoptosis in
malignant glioma cells
to determine whether u87-mg and u373-mg cells
treated with t-oligos undergo increased apoptosis, we
performed apoptosis detection assays. the annexin
v-fitc apoptosis detection assay revealed no signiﬁ-
cant increase in apoptotic u373-mg cells treated with
40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 72 h compared with
control (vehicle alone; fig. 2a). a 4 nm concentration
of paclitaxel, which was used as a positive control to
induce apoptosis in malignant glioma cells, induced
apoptosis in 15% of u373-mg cells. similar results were
observed in u87-mg cells treated with 40 ␮m t-oligos
and c-oligos for 72 h (data not shown). to determine
the incidence of apoptosis morphologically, we stained
the nuclei of treated tumor cells with hoechst 33258.
as shown in fig. 2b, apoptotic morphological charac-
teristics such as chromatin condensation and nuclear
fragmentation were detected in u373-mg cells treated
with 4 nm paclitaxel but not in those treated with 40
␮m c-oligos or t-oligos. to quantify the incidence of
apoptosis, we counted 200 cells and scored for the
incidence of apoptosis. treatment with paclitaxel at 4
nm for 72 h induced apoptosis in 15% of u87-mg cells
and 11% of u373-mg cells (p⬍0.01 compared with
control; fig. 2c). on the other hand, treatments with
t-oligos at 40 ␮m for 72 h induced apoptosis in 5.5% of
u87-mg cells and 3.4% of u373-mg cells. compared
with control or c-oligos treatment, t-oligos treatment
did not signiﬁcantly increase apoptotic cells. even when
u373-mg cells were treated with t-oligos at 80 ␮m for
7 days, ⬍10% of u373-mg cells were apoptotic (fig.
2d). paclitaxel at 4 nm for 7 days induced apoptosis in
30% of u373-mg cells. these results indicate that the
main growth inhibition induced by t-oligos in these
malignant glioma cells is not due to induction of
apoptosis, although apoptotic pathway was activated to
some extent by t-oligos, particularly at late time points
and high concentrations.
t-oligos induce autophagy in malignant glioma cells
malignant glioma cells treated with various anticancer
agents undergo autophagy rather than apoptosis (28).
we used electron microscopic analysis to determine
whether t-oligos induce autophagy in malignant gli-
oma cells. as shown in fig. 3a, numerous autophagic
vacuoles were observed in u373-mg cells treated with
40 ␮m t-oligos for 72 h, whereas untreated u373-mg
cells or u373-mg cells treated with 40 ␮m c-oligos for
72 h exhibited few autophagic features. in u373-mg
cells incubated with 4 nm paclitaxel for 72 h, we
observed fewer autophagic vacuoles with clear chroma-
tin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, which is
characteristic of apoptosis. as expected based on the
data of the annexin v assay and hoechst 33258 stain-
ing, we found no evidence of apoptosis in u373-mg
cells treated with 40 ␮m c-oligos or t-oligos for 72 h.

development of avos by t-oligos
to detect and quantify the t-oligo-induced increase in
fractional volume and acidity of avos, we stained
treated tumor cells with acridine orange for ﬂow cyto-
metric analysis. as shown in fig. 3b, 40 ␮m t-oligos for
72 h increased the amount and frequency of red
ﬂuorescence (y axis) in u373-mg and u87-mg cells,
indicating development of avos from 3.7 to 60.9% and
from 2.6 to 30.1%, respectively. in contrast, treatment
with 40 ␮m c-oligos for 72 h induced only a modest
increase in avos (7.2% in u373-mg cells and 2.7% in
u87-mg cells).
induction of gfp-lc3 dots by t-oligos
we also assessed the presence of a punctate pattern of
gfp-lc3 expression (gfp-lc3 dots) to determine
whether lc3 is concentrated in autophagic vacuoles in
malignant glioma cells by t-oligos. u373-mg and
u87-mg cells were transiently transfected with gfp-
lc3 expression vector for 24 h and then treated with
c-oligos or t-oligos at 40 ␮m for an additional 72 h, as
described previously (18, 23). the gfp-lc3-transfected
cells showed diffuse distribution of gfp-lc3 under
untreated conditions or in the presence of c-oligos,
whereas t-oligo-treated u373-mg and u87-mg cells
showed a marked increase in number and frequency of

lc3 dots, whereas these autophagic features were de-
tected in only 5.2% of untreated u373-mg cells and

expressing gfp-lc3 in a punctate pattern was signiﬁ-
cantly increased in u373-mg and u 87-mg cells treated
with t-oligos compared those treated with c-oligos
(p⬍0.01).
increase in lc3-ii expression by t-oligos
a recent investigation showed that there are two forms
of the lc3 proteins in cells; lc3-i and lc3-ii (21).
lc3-i is the cytoplasmic form of lc3 and is processed
into lc3-ii, which is associated with the autophagoso-
mal membrane. therefore, the amount of lc3-ii is
associated with autophagy induction. western blotting
with anti-lc3 antibody revealed that the expression of
lc3-i and lc3-ii proteins markedly increased in
u373-mg cells treated with 40 ␮m t-oligos for 48 h
compared with that in cells treated with c-oligos under
the same treatment conditions (fig. 3d), suggesting
that t-oligos induce the synthesis of lc3 protein and
the conversion of a substantial fraction of lc3-i into
lc3-ii. these results together indicate that t-oligos but
not c-oligos induce autophagy in malignant glioma
cells.
effect of inhibition of t-oligo-induced autophagy on
malignant glioma cells
whether anticancer treatments-induced autophagy is a
protective response or nonapoptotic cell death is still
debatable (28). therefore, we used 3-ma to inhibit
t-oligo-induced autophagy as described previously
(27). treatment with 3-ma (2.0 mm) in the presence of
40 ␮m t-oligos for 72 h suppressed the development of
avos in u87-mg cells (down to 11.7%) and u373-mg
cells (down to 0.9%). as shown in fig. 3e, the de-
creased viability of u87-mg and u373-mg cells was
signiﬁcantly reversed by addition of 3-ma (p⬍0.01
each). these results indicate that t-oligo-induced au-
tophagy mediates cell killing effect rather than protec-
tive reaction.

compared with c-oligos,
the phosphorylation of
stat3 at ser727, which is associated with cell death
(32), was suppressed in both tumor cells 30 and 60 min
after exposure to t-oligos. t-oligos increased the phos-
phorylation level of gsk3 at ser21/9, which is recog-
nized as a key component of cell growth and death
(33), in u373-mg cells at 15 min and in u87-mg cells
later. on the other hand, the phosphorylation of the
intracellular proto-oncogene src at tyr416, which is
related to the akt pathway (34), was increased in
u87-mg cells 30 min after treatment with t-oligos but
was not affected in u373-mg cells. these results indi-
cate that phosphorylations of signaling molecules in
several pathways are altered differently and/or op-
posed each other in u87-mg and u373-mg cells.
assay for signaling through the pi3k/akt/mtor, the
ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) path-
way, cell cycle, pkc, src, jak/stat, and apoptosis
pathways. tor kinase—mtor in mammalian cells—is
located upstream of autophagy-associated genes and
regulates the autophagic pathway (29). in addition, not
only the mtor and its upstream molecule akt but also
mapks play a key role in regulating autophagy (28, 30,
31). therefore, we focused on these molecules. as
shown in supplemental fig. 1, the phosphorylation of
akt at thr308 and ser473 was increased in u87-mg cells
15 and 30 min after exposure to t-oligos, whereas it was
suppressed in u373-mg cells 15 min after the addition
of t-oligos. t-oligos inhibited the phosphorylation of
mtor at ser2448 in both tumor cell lines at 15 min but
stimulated the phosphorylation in u373-mg cells at 30
and 60 min. the phosphorylation of p38 at thr180/
tyr182, one of mapks, was increased in u87-mg but not
u373-mg cells by c-oligos compared with t-oligos.
to conﬁrm the data of rppm, we conducted western
blotting at the same treatment conditions. as shown in
fig. 4a, western blotting was consistent with some
results of rppm but not with others. in particular, the
phosphorylation of akt was not affected in both tumor
cells by t-oligos, but the phosphorylation of mtor was
inhibited in u87-mg cells but not u373-mg cells 60
min after t-oligo treatment. t-oligos suppressed the
phosphorylation of stat3 but not p38 in both tumor
cells 60 min after the treatment. one explanation for
the discrepancy between rppm and western blotting
may be that antibodies are not absolutely mono-speciﬁc
and that rppm cumulates speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc
labeling, although mono-speciﬁc bands can be chosen
in western blotting. to analyze the data of western
blotting statistically, we repeated the same experiments
three times. as shown in fig. 4b, there was no signiﬁ-
cant change in the phosphorylation of akt and p38. in
u87-mg cells, the phosphorylation of mtor was sig-
niﬁcantly decreased after 60 min of exposure to t-
oligos (p⬍0.05). because mtor is located downstream
of akt, the inhibitory effect of t-oligos on mtor in
u87-mg cells may be akt independent. moreover,
t-oligos signiﬁcantly inhibited the phosphorylation of
stat3 in u87-mg cells (p⬍0.05, 60 min) and in
u373-mg cells (p⬍0.05, 30 min; p⬍0.01, 60 min).
to assess the involvement of mtor and stat3 in
cytotoxicity of t-oligo, we used an inhibitor of each
pathway and determined whether inhibition of mtor
or stat3 affects the effect of t-oligos. to inhibit the
mtor pathway, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mtor, was
used as described previously (35). as shown in fig. 4c,
the addition of rapamycin (1 nm) signiﬁcantly en-
hanced the effect of t-oligos on the viability of u87-mg
cells (p⬍0.001). on the other hand, we used ag490, an
inhibitor of stat3, as described previously (36). as
shown in fig. 4d, the addition of ag490 (50 ␮m)
signiﬁcantly increased the sensitivity of u87-mg cells
(p⬍0.001) and u373-mg cells (p⬍0.001) to t-oligos.
these results indicate that inhibition of the mtor or
stat3 pathway plays a key role in cytotoxicity of
t-oligo in malignant glioma cells.
to clarify the relationship between autophagy and
the effects of rapamycin and ag490, we determined
whether these inhibitors affect t-oligo-induced autoph-
agy in u87-mg and u373-mg cells by using gfp-lc3
dot assay. as shown in fig. 4e, the addition of rapamy-
cin increased the percentage of t-oligo-induced auto-
phagic cells with gfp-lc3 dots compared with c-oligo
treatment (31– 48% in u87-mg cells and 35–57% in
u373-mg cells, p⬍0.01). in addition, ag490 aug-
mented the incidence of autophagic cells caused by
t-oligos compared with c-oligos (21–37% in u87-mg
cells and 38 –58% in u373-mg cells, p⬍0.01). these
results indicate that
the effects of rapamycin and
ag490 are positively implicated in t-oligo-induced
autophagy.
t-oligos hyperpolarize mitochondria
a recent study showed that radiation and rapamycin
lead to hyperpolarization of mitochondria and subse-
quently induce autophagy in breast cancer cells (37).
therefore, to determine whether t-oligos cause hyper-
polarization of mitochondria in malignant glioma cells,
we measured the mitochondria membrane potential
with rhodamine 123. as shown in fig. 5, compared with
c-oligos, treatment with 40 ␮m t-oligo for 72 h in-
duced an increase in membrane potential from 0.1 to
38.8% in u373-mg cells and 0.7 to 31.2% in u87-mg
cells,
indicating mitochondrial hyperpolarization by
t-oligos.
t-oligos do not affect telomere length
to rule out the possibility that t-oligos promote accel-
erated telomere shortening contributing to autophagy
in malignant glioma cells, we determined the mtl
after treating u373-mg cells with 40 ␮m c-oligos or
t-oligos for 3 or 5 days. treatment with t-oligos for 3 or
5 days did not alter the mtl (5.72 or 5.92 kb with
t-oligos treatment; 5.75 or 5.69 kb without treatment;
and 5.76 or 5.71 kb with c-oligos treatment), respec-
tively (fig. 6). these results, together with those of
recent studies (12, 14), indicate that t-oligos do not

undetectable. those two mice showed no weight loss or

these results indicate that t-oligos reduce tumorigen-
esis in vivo, suggesting that they have the potential to

the duplex region (8). disruption of this loop structure
leads to exposure and degradation of the 3⬘ overhang
and eventually to the induction of dna damage re-
sponses (9). accumulating evidence shows that t-oli-
gos, which we hypothesize mimic telomere loop disrup-
tion and overhang exposure,
induce apoptosis or
senescence in malignant cells from multiple cell lin-
eages (10 –15) but have far less effect on the normal
counterparts of these cells (11, 14). another study
demonstrated that t-oligos pretreatment reduced the
mutation rate and photocarcinogenesis in uv-irradi-
ated mice (38) and decreased the expression of cyclo-
oxygenase-2 in human skin explants (39), suggesting
additional anticancer mechanisms of action for t-
oligos. in the present study, t-oligos induced autoph-
agy instead of apoptosis in malignant glioma cells. both
autophagy and apoptosis represent
forms of pro-
grammed cell death; however, the molecular mecha-
nisms are markedly different in both cases. this dis-
crepancy might be due to the cancer cell type tested
because malignant glioma cells have a tendency to
undergo autophagy rather than apoptosis after antican-
cer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy
(23, 40 – 44).
autophagy is a process in which intracellular mem-
brane structures sequester proteins and organelles to
degrade and recycle these materials (45). these re-
sponses are dominated by the appearance and accumu-
lation of avos (20). induction of autophagy has been
seen in various cell conditions,
including nutrient
deprivation, differentiation, aging, and cancer therapy
(28, 30, 31, 46). in lower organisms, autophagy allows
survival during stress by generating energy from intra-
cellular sources. however, prolonged autophagy results
in cell death. thus, autophagy is best thought of as a
temporary stress survival process that eventuates into
cell death. thus, autophagy could both increase or
decrease tumor development depending on the con-
text. autophagy has been frequently compared with
apoptosis as a response of cancer cells to treatments on
the basis of
its morphological appearances; pro-
grammed cell death type i (apoptosis) and type ii
(autophagic cell death) (47). apoptosis has typical
morphological and biochemical characteristics such as
nuclear condensation and fragmentation and is associ-
ated with caspase activation. in this study, ⬍10% of
apoptosis was observed in t-oligo-treated u373-mg
cells, although paclitaxel induced apoptosis in 30% of
the same cell line. on the other hand, autophagic cell
death is generally caspase independent (48) but also
associated with typical morphological changes includ-
ing induction of multilamellar vesicles. it appears likely
that crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy exists
with the balance determining why some tumor cells die
from apoptosis and others from autophagy.
the rppm is best used under these circumstances to
determine which signaling molecules and pathways
warrant further exploration. thus, we used these to
direct western blotting studies and perform statistical
analysis on multiple samples. our data indicated the
figure 7. effect of t-oligos on growth of intracranial u87-mg

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that t-oligos inhibited
the growth of malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo
without decreases in the viability of nhas, suggesting
the existence of a favorable therapeutic index. treat-
ment with t-oligos induced nonapoptotic autophagy
associated with down-regulation of
the mtor or
stat3 signaling pathway in malignant glioma cells.
mitochondrial hyperpolarization, which occurs in radi-
ation-induced autophagy (37), was observed in malig-
nant glioma cells undergoing autophagy. these ﬁnd-
ings suggest that t-oligos are a promising therapeutic
agent for managing malignant gliomas exhibiting a
novel mechanism of induction of cell death.

involvement of mtor or stat3 signaling pathway in
the cytotoxicity of t-oligo for u87-mg and u373-mg
cells. in mammalian cells, mtor is well established as
a signaling system that contributes to the control of the
autophagic pathway (31, 45). because rapamycin,
which causes autophagy in malignant glioma cells (35,
44), enhanced the antitumor effect of t-oligos, mtor
may be one of key molecules regulating the cytotoxicity
of t-oligo for at least u87-mg cells. on the other hand,
our ﬁndings indicated that stat3 is involved in the
efﬁcacy of t-oligo, although there is no study demon-
strating the relationship between autophagy and
stat3. thus, the predictions from the rppm data,
particularly when concordance is observed between the
cell lines analyzed, are highly predictive of functional
importance. however, those effects that are observed in
only one cell line are likely related to the pathogenic
rewiring of
the signaling pathways by underlying
genomic aberrations. more importantly, the signaling
pathway is extremely complex with a number of feed
forward and feed back loops as well as crosstalk with
multiple other signaling networks. therefore, further
study is needed to determine which molecule is more
important or associated with autophagy.
our ﬁndings suggest that t-oligos have the potential
to suppress the proliferation of malignant glioma cells
in vitro and in vivo. pretreatment of malignant glioma
cells, as was done in this study, is not equivalent to
treating tumor cells already established in the brain.
however, in a similar mouse model of melanoma (11),
the selective inability of t-oligo-pretreated melanoma
cells to produce metastases when injected intravenously
predicted their ability to reduce tumor burden in vivo.
in any case, our data show that relatively brief exposure
to t-oligos has a long-lasting effect on malignant gli-
oma cells that is not reversed by the tissue environment.
therefore, we will further assess whether treatment
with t-oligos prolongs the survival of mice carrying
established intracranial tumors and determine the util-
ity of t-oligos in therapy.
