summary
the immune response-deﬁcient 1 (ird1) gene was iden-
tiﬁed in a forward genetic screen as a novel regulator
for the activation of imd nfkb immune signalling
pathway in drosophila. ird1 animals are also more
susceptible to escherichia coli and micrococcus
luteus bacterial infection. ird1 encodes the drosophila
homologue of the vps15/p150 serine/threonine kinase
that regulates a class iii phosphoinositide 3-kinase
and is necessary for phagosome maturation and
starvation-induced autophagy in yeast and mamma-
lian cells. to gain insight into the role of ird1 in the
immune response, we examine how amino acid star-
vation affects the immune signalling pathways in
drosophila. starvation, in the absence of infection,
leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (amp)
genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and
the imd immune signalling pathway. starvation, in
addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the amp
response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability
to survive m. luteus infection. our results suggest that
starvation and innate immune signalling may be inti-
mately linked processes.
introduction
insects induce a battery of antimicrobial peptides (amps)
in response to infection. infection of drosophila melano-
gaster with either bacterial or fungal pathogens induces
expression of select amp genes, indicating that there is
speciﬁcity in the immune response (lemaitre et al., 1997).
two signalling pathways, named imd and toll, have been
shown to regulate a majority of the humoral (secreted)
immune response in drosophila (de gregorio et al.,
2002). these signalling pathways are highly conserved
with mammalian innate immune pathways, as both are
mediated by toll-like receptors, peptidoglycan recognition

proteins (pgrps) and nfkb/rel
(hoffmann, 2003).
transcription factors
the imd pathway is characterized as being activated in
response to gram– bacterial infection, and results in the
expression of several antibacterial peptide genes includ-
ing diptericin (hoffmann, 2003). upon infection with
gram– bacteria, the gram– diaminopimelic acid-type pep-
tidoglycan is recognized by pgrp-lc (choe et al., 2002;
gottar et al., 2002; takehana et al., 2002; leulier et al.,
2003; kaneko et al., 2004) and pgrp-le (takehana
et al., 2002; 2004). these receptors transduce the signal
via the death domain containing adaptor, imd (georgel
et al., 2001), and the kinases, dtak, a mapkkk (vidal
et al., 2001; silverman et al., 2003; park et al., 2004), and
the ikb kinase (ikk) complex of ird5 (dmikkb) (silverman
et al., 2000; lu et al., 2001) and kenny (the ikkc homo-
logue) (rutschmann et al., 2000a). dtak is important for
activation of both nfkb and jnk pathways (silverman
et al., 2003) and plays a key role in cross-talk between
these two pathways (park et al., 2004). ikk leads to phos-
phorylation of relish (silverman et al., 2000), a bipartite
protein with rel homology domains and an inhibitory
ankyrin repeat domain, similar to mammalian p100 and
p105 (hedengren et al., 1999). phosphorylated relish is
believed to become a substrate for the caspase dredd
that cleaves between the rel domains and the inhibitory
ankyrin repeat domains (stoven et al., 2003). the
n-terminal rel portion of relish is freed of its inhibition
and retention in the cytoplasm, and translocates to the
nucleus to activate transcription of antibacterial peptide
genes.
the toll pathway has been demonstrated to respond to
fungal and gram+ bacterial
infection and results in the
expression of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin
(lemaitre et al., 1996; meng et al., 1999; rutschmann
et al., 2000b). fungi and gram+ bacteria are recognized
by two different pathways that converge to activate the
toll ligand, spätzle (levashina et al., 1999; ligoxygakis
et al., 2002; gobert et al., 2003). the processed form of
spätzle activates the receptor toll (weber et al., 2003; hu
et al., 2004). downstream of toll activation, the adaptors
myd88 (krapfen)
(tauszig-delamasure et al., 2002;
charatsi et al., 2003) and tube activate pelle, a serine/
threonine kinase homologous to mammalian irak
(letsou et al., 1991; shelton and wasserman, 1993;
grosshans et al., 1994). cactus, the ikb homologue, is
1074 j. wu, k. e. randle and l. p. wu
then phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and targeted for
degradation (belvin et al., 1995; bergmann et al., 1996;
reach et al., 1996). upon degradation, cactus can no
longer inhibit the two nfkb transcription factors, dorsal
and dif, and they translocate to the nucleus and regulate
expression of immune target genes like the antifungal
peptide gene, drosomycin (lemaitre et al., 1995; meng
et al., 1999; rutschmann et al., 2000b).
antimicrobial peptides were originally identiﬁed as
haemolymph proteins that were induced in response to
infection and had direct antimicrobial function (boman,
2000). more recently, genome-wide microarray studies in
drosophila have indicated that the amp genes are also
induced in response to ageing, oxidative stress, auto-
phagic cell death and starvation (pletcher et al., 2002;
zinke et al., 2002; lee et al., 2003; landis et al., 2004).
as these are conditions not normally associated with
microbial
infection, it suggests that the amp signalling
pathways are activated by other conditions, and amps
may have a larger role in the physiology of the animal.
the ability to respond to infection requires energy and
an immune response is tied to a concomitant activation
of metabolic pathways (lochmiller and deerenberg,
2000). in mammals, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines or sepsis
can trigger hypermetabolism which is important for the
function of nutrient-demanding macrophages and for the
large production of acute-phase proteins. similarly, the
adaptive immune response which involves clonal expan-
sion of lymphocytes is also energy-expensive; mounting
an antibody response comes with a signiﬁcant energy
cost
(demas et al., 1997) and activating a cellular
response is dependent on the ability to mobilize glyco-
lytic energy stores (frauwirth et al., 2002). because of
the substantial energy cost
required to sustain an
the magnitude of an animal’s
immune response,
response can ultimately be limited by insufficient energy
resources. human populations with higher incidence of
malnutrition tend to be more susceptible to infectious dis-
eases (chandra, 1996). mice subjected to starvation are
less likely to survive endotoxic shock (faggioni et al.,
2000) or chronic infections like tuberculosis (chan et al.,
1996).
pathways
and
nutrient-sensing
the evidence indicates that
there are interactions
between
immune
responses (matarese and la cava, 2004). to date, not
much is known about the molecular mechanisms linking
nutrient levels to immune signalling – the evidence to this
point has been largely correlative. in drosophila, nutrient
sensing occurs through the insulin and the target of rapa-
mycin (tor) pathways (britton et al., 2002; scott et al.,
2004). these pathways are highly conserved in animals
and have been primarily studied for their effects on
growth.
insulin signalling is a hormone-based system
which regulates cellular and organismal growth (britton
et al., 2002). the tor pathway responds to nutrient
levels to regulate protein synthesis and cell growth
(oldham et al., 2000; zhang et al., 2000). during starva-
tion, inhibition of the tor pathway can induce autophagy,
a process by which the cell recycles unwanted proteins
and organelles to generate amino acids for other pur-
poses (scott et al., 2004). downstream of tor signalling,
a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) complex consisting of
the class iii pi3k, vps34 and its regulatory partner/
subunit, vps15 or p150, a serine-threonine kinase (stack
et al., 1995), are important components of
the cell
machinery to initiate autophagy (petiot et al., 2000). this
pi3k complex is also important for later events in endocy-
tosis and phagocytosis in mammalian cells (fratti et al.,
2001; futter et al., 2001; vieira et al., 2001), and for the
sorting of proteins and vesicles to the vacuole (lysosome
equivalent) in yeast (stack et al., 1995), so it is likely that
the complex acts at a common key regulatory point for
several cellular trafficking events.
we have identiﬁed the immune response deﬁcient 1
(ird1) gene as a novel regulator affecting both the imd and
toll pathways. ird1 mutants are unable to activate the imd
pathway, but have phenotypes that resemble constitutive
activation of the toll pathway. ird1 encodes the drosophila
homologue of
the saccharomyces cerevisiae vps15
serine/threonine kinase known for its role in endocytosis,
phagocytosis and starvation-induced autophagy in yeast
and mammalian cells (petiot et al., 2000; fratti et al.,
2001; futter et al., 2001; vieira et al., 2001). in exploring
how a defect in one of these cellular processes might
impact an innate immune response, we conﬁrm the obser-
vation that amino acid starvation in the absence of infec-
tion induces amp responses (zinke et al., 2002). the
starvation-triggered induction of these amp responses
requires ird1 and the imd signalling pathway. the use of
shared signalling pathways in both starvation and immune
responses may provide a molecular mechanism for the
regulation of innate immune responses in the context of
nutrient control.
results
ird1 is important for antibacterial immune responses
in an effort to identify novel components of the imd anti-
bacterial pathway, we screened for ethylmethane
sulfonate-induced mutations on the third chromosome
that impaired the induction of a diptericin–lacz reporter
gene in third-instar larvae upon infection with escherichia
coli (wu and anderson, 1998; wu et al., 2001). two
mutant alleles of ird1 were identiﬁed in the original screen.
five more ird1 alleles were identiﬁed in subsequent
genetic screens for mutations that failed to complement
the lethality of the original alleles. these ﬁve ird1 alleles

fig. 1. ird1 affects antimicrobial peptide (amp) gene expression. shown are the expression levels in wild type (or), ird11, ird12 and cact
(cacta2/cact255) in uninfected or infected with e. coli for 2 h larvae as measured by quantitative real-time pcr (q-rt-pcr). diptericin
expression is reduced in ird11 and ird12 as compared with wild type (or) in response to e. coli infection for 2 h. drosomycin was constitutively
expressed in the mutants. we see variability in the expression of the other amps in the ird1 alleles, ranging from low (attacin, defensin,
drosocin) to wild-type (cecropin a, metchnikowin) expression levels. the data suggest that the regulation of some of these other amps may
be impaired. in contrast to the diptericin and drosomycin amp genes, the combinatorial contributions of the imd and toll pathways in the
regulation of the other amps are not as well characterized. cactus (cacta2/cact255) mutants which also constitutively express drosomycin were
examined for comparison. the expression levels have been normalized to rp49 levels and wild type uninfected has been set at 1 for
comparison between experiments. the experiments were performed in triplicate and the error bars indicate standard deviation. one-tail t-tests
were used to compare wild type infected and uninfected to the corresponding amp levels in the ird1 or cactus mutants. p-values < 0.05 were
deemed signiﬁcant and marked with asterisks.
also fail to complement the original alleles for the induc-
tion of the diptericin–lacz reporter gene. we chose to
study ird1 from among the 14 genes identiﬁed in the
screen because the mutation appeared to affect both the
imd and toll signalling pathways. quantitative real-time
pcr analysis demonstrated that ird1 mutants failed to
induce the antibacterial peptide gene diptericin, which
conﬁrms the diptericin–lacz result
from the screen
(fig. 1). diptericin is considered to be a speciﬁc target
gene of the imd pathway, because its induction is not
affected by toll pathway mutations (hedengren et al.,
1999; meng et al., 1999; rutschmann et al., 2000b). our
result therefore suggests that ird1 is acting in the imd
pathway (fig. 1). we found that drosomycin, the target
gene speciﬁcally activated by the toll pathway, was con-
stitutively expressed at a high level in ird1 mutants. this is
the opposite phenotype to that seen for diptericin. con-
stitutive drosomycin expression has been observed in
mutants that activate the toll pathway, such as toll10b
(gain of function) mutants and cactus (loss of function)
mutants (lemaitre et al., 1996).
we were interested in assaying other amp genes
because they are regulated to some degree by both the
imd and toll pathways. the opposing effects ird1 has on
the two pathways appeared to affect the expression levels
of attacin, defensin and drosocin. we saw differences in
the ird1 alleles’ effects on these amps making it difficult to
draw conclusions. in ird11 animals, the induction of these
amps in response to infection is less than that of wild
type, similar to the effect of ird1 on diptericin. but the
uninduced level of these amps is also higher than wild-
type uninduced levels, suggestive of the effect of ird1 on

drosomycin. in general, the effect the ird1 mutation had
on these amp genes appeared to be more dramatic than
the phenotype seen in cactus mutants. we found that the
amps metchnikowin and cecropin were still inducible to
near wild-type levels in ird1 mutants, indicating that ird1
does not have a non-speciﬁc effect on the induction of all
the amp genes. this amp phenotype differed from other
mutations identiﬁed from the original genetic screen that
had non-speciﬁc effects on the fat body tissue, e.g.
scribble/ird15, and resulted in decreased expression of all
the amps examined (wu et al., 2001).
to determine where ird1 acts in the imd signalling
pathway, we used genetic epistasis analyses. the imd
pathway can be activated in the absence of infection by
ectopic expression of
the imd pathway components;
these gain-of-function mutations are placed in combina-
tion with loss-of-function mutations affecting the pathway,
and this can be used to determine the order of
the
components. the uas-gal4 expression system from
yeast has been used as a heterologous expression
system in drosophila, and transgenic ﬂy lines that express
the gal4 transactivator in different tissues are widely
available (brand and perrimon, 1993). we conﬁrmed that
the c564-gal4 driver [that drives expression of uas-
promoted genes in the fat body, lymph glands and other
tissues (harrison et al., 1995)] can lead to constitutive
expression of diptericin, when placed in combination with
uas lines of the imd pathway components, pgrp-le,
imd, dredd or dtak (georgel et al., 2001; vidal et al.,
2001; takehana et al., 2002). we found that ird1 was able
to suppress ectopic expression of diptericin in the c564-
gal4-driven uas-pgrp-le, uas-imd or uas-dredd
ﬂies, but not in the uas-dtak ﬂies (fig. 2). in sum, our
results suggest that ird1 may be acting downstream of
pgrp-le, imd and dredd, but upstream of dtak in the
imd pathway. presumably, ird1 is acting in the same cells

than the oregon r (or) wild-type stock. shown are survival curves over a 6 h period for oregon r and ird1 third-instar larvae injected with
e. coli, m. luteus or pbs. survival after e. coli injection differed signiﬁcantly between wild type and ird1 (p = 0.03), as did survival after
m. luteus infection (p = 0.0027). there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in survival after pbs injection between wild type and ird1
(p = 0.29), or between wild-type survival in response to pbs compared with infection with e. coli or m. luteus (p = 0.28 and p = 0.32
respectively).
in which the imd signalling is occurring. a formal alterna-
tive is that ird1 may be acting in a pathway parallel to the
imd pathway in a complex manner.
to examine where ird1 was acting in the toll pathway,
we determined whether toll pathway mutations could sup-
press the constitutive drosomycin expression in ird1
mutants. a mutation in spätzle (spz) was able to suppress
the drosomycin expression. as spätzle is the ligand for
toll (weber et al., 2003; hu et al., 2004), it suggests that
ird1’s effect on the toll signalling pathway may be
upstream of the fat body amp response. we next exam-
ined the epistasis of ird1 relative to dif. dif is downstream
in the toll pathway and important for the regulation of
drosomycin expression in larvae. we found that a muta-
tion in dif was able to suppress the constitutive expres-
sion of drosomycin in ird1 animals (fig. 2). this suggests
that the constitutive drosomycin expression seen in ird1
animals is due to activation of the toll pathway.
the amp signalling pathways are often used to assess
activation of the immune response, but a more meaningful
measure of a functional immune response is the animal’s
ability to withstand bacterial infection. the effects of an
ird1 mutation on survival of a bacterial challenge was
tested using the gram– bacteria, e. coli and the gram+
bacteria, micrococcus luteus. these bacteria are not
pathogenic to wild-type oregon r ﬂies (fig. 3) and are
often used to assay alterations in the imd and toll path-
ways respectively. we ﬁnd that ird1 animals are signiﬁ-
cantly more susceptible than wild type to both e. coli
(p = 0.03) and m. luteus (p = 0.0027)
infection. the
e. coli effect is consistent with the loss of imd pathway
function. the m. luteus susceptibility is counterintuitive as
the toll pathway is believed to be important for ﬁghting a
gram+ bacterial
infection. however, our results indicate
that constitutive activation of the toll pathway is not pro-
tective against gram+ bacteria, and instead makes the
animals more susceptible to infection.
the ird1 gene encodes the drosophila homologue
of the vps15 kinase
recombination and deﬁciency mapping localized the ird1
gene to the 85c1;85d8 interval on the third chromosome.
using male recombination mapping relative to p-elements
in the region, ird1 mapped to the right of ep473 that was
inserted in the d1 gene (fig. 4a). from sequencing the
candidate genes in the region in the ird1 alleles, we iden-
tiﬁed cg9746, a serine/threonine kinase with wd40
repeats as a good candidate for ird1. five out of the seven
ird1 alleles have mutations that result in premature stop
codons in cg9746 that would lead to truncated proteins
(fig. 4b).
to verify that mutations in cg9746 were the cause of
ird1 phenotypes, we generated transgenic ﬂies express-
ing the ird1 gene under the control of an inducible pro-
moter (brand and perrimon, 1993). expression of this
gene (p[w+, uas-ird1]) in the ird1 mutant animals was
sufficient to rescue the lethality and the amp phenotype,
conﬁrming that cg9746 is the ird1 gene. the p[w+, uas-
ird1 pa10-68] insertion line in the absence of a gal4
driver resulted in sufficient expression of the transgene for
rescue of the ird1 phenotypes so this was used for the
rescue experiments (fig. 4c).
ird1 encodes the drosophila protein most similar to
yeast vps15, a gene necessary for targeting proteins to
the vacuole,

a. ird1 was mapped to the 85c1;85d8 interval using meiotic recombination and deﬁciency mapping. from male recombination mapping, it
was determined that ird1 was distal to ep473. genes coding left to right are shown as blocks above the line and genes coding right to left are
blocks below the line. the gene names shown were the ird1 candidate genes examined by complementation if mutations were available or
sequence analysis.
b. mutations in cg9746, a serine/threonine kinase with wd40 repeats, were identiﬁed in the ird1 alleles. the ird1 lethality was used in
secondary genetic screens to identify ﬁve ird1 alleles, designated as ird13, ird14, ird15, ird16 and ird17. no changes in the open reading frame
were detected in the ird17 allele. ird11 and ird12 are the result of stop codons that would truncate the protein after the kinase domain. ird13 and
ird16 mutations result in premature stop codons in the wd40 region. ird14 results in two amino acid (a.a.) changes in the wd40 region, a
glycine to aspartic acid change at a.a. 986 and a valine to isoleucine change at a.a. 1337. the latter change is highly conservative and is
seen in the mouse and human ird1 homologues (fig. s1 in supplementary material), so it is likely that the mutant phenotype arises from the
glycine-986 to aspartic acid change. the ird15 mutation arises from a c to t substitution that introduces a stop codon at a.a. 144, leading to a
protein truncated within the kinase domain and lacking the last 1199 amino acids. we were unable to detect any sequence changes in the
cg9746 open reading frame in the ird17 allele, so it may be a regulatory mutation. ird1/cg9746 sequence and its alignment to homologues in
other species are shown in fig. s1.
c. expression of uas-ird1 in ird1 mutant ﬂies rescues the ird1 immune defects. the p[w+uas-ird1 pa10-68] insertion line in the absence of a
gal4 driver resulted in sufficient expression of the transgene for rescue of the ird1 phenotypes. shown is the rescue of the ird12 amp
phenotype with recovery of diptericin expression in infected larvae and reduction of the constitutive drosomycin expression.

fig. 5. effects of amino acid starvation on antimicrobial peptide immune phenotypes.
a. in wild-type (or) larvae, starvation (s) in the absence of infection (–) signiﬁcantly induces the expression of diptericin, drosocin,
drosomycin and metchnikowin as measured by q-rt-pcr; shown are wild-type larvae either not starved (ns), starved (s) for 3 h, and
uninfected (–) or infected with e. coli (+) for an additional 3 h. the induction of attacin, cecropin, defensin and drosocin is signiﬁcantly
lowered if the animals have been starved before infection.
b. both ird1 and the imd pathway are required for the starvation-induced expression of diptericin and metchnikowin. drosomycin expression
was largely unaffected by loss of the imd and toll pathways. oregon r, not starved or starved (indicated with the line), and ird1, toll
(tl9qrx/df(3r)roxb3); relish (rele20); imd, spzrm7 (double mutant for imd and toll pathways) mutants all subjected to starvation.
in second-instar larvae subjected to amino acid and sugar
starvation (zinke et al., 2002). for our experiments, we
used an amino acid starvation paradigm that had been
demonstrated to affect the nutrient-sensing tor pathway
in the fat body of third-instar larvae (scott et al., 2004).
this starvation response has been better characterized
and occurs in the same stage and tissue that we use for
observing the ird1 immune phenotypes. we conﬁrmed the
initial microarray results by observing that a drosomycin-
green ﬂuorescent protein (gfp)
is strongly
reporter
induced at 3 h in amino acid-starved l3 animals (data not
shown). the induction of
the drosomycin-gfp after
amino acid starvation was more consistent from animal to
animal, than the induction we typically observe with bac-
terial infection. we next examined the effect of amino acid
starvation on the expression of the other known amp
genes by quantitative real-time pcr. amino acid starva-
tion signiﬁcantly induced diptericin, drosocin, drosomycin
and metchnikowin independent of
infection (fig. 5a).

ferent from that normally induced by bacterial infection.
the induction of amps under conditions not usually asso-
ciated with an immune response raises questions as to
both the role of amps in those processes, and how star-
vation might
impact amp expression for the immune
response. we ﬁnd if animals are subjected to amino acid
starvation, the expression of all the amps are lowered
compared with that seen with infection alone. the differ-
ence is signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) for all but metchnikowin. in
particular, the expression of the amps, attacin, cecropin,
defensin and drosocin is dramatically lowered in
response to infection (fig. 5a). in general, the effects of
starvation appear
the infection-
induced response, as addition of infection shows a similar
effect to that of starvation alone. there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the expression of cecropin, drosocin, dip-
tericin and drosomycin upon infection in the starved
animals. for attacin and defensin, there was a signiﬁcant
difference upon infection in the starved animals, but the
overall level of expression was more similar to that seen in
starved uninfected animals than that of well-fed infected
animals.
to be epistatic over
we performed an epistasis experiment to determine
where the starvation signal ﬁt relative to the immune
signalling pathways (fig. 5b). we examined whether
mutants affecting the imd pathway (relish and ird1), the
toll pathway (toll) or both pathways (imd spätzle double
mutant) could still
induce diptericin, drosomycin and
metchnikowin in response to starvation. starvation-
induced expression of diptericin and metchnikowin was
dependent on ird1 and the imd pathway. this suggests
that ird1 and the imd pathway are downstream of the
starvation signal and that the starvation signal either acts
through the imd pathway or works as a co-signal
in
parallel to the imd pathway. the starvation induction of
drosomycin appeared to be largely independent of both
imd and toll pathway function. this suggests that droso-
mycin is regulated by a parallel signalling process in
starved ﬂies and may be more complex than the toll
pathway-dependent induction of drosomycin observed in
the ird1 mutants.
to determine how the starvation-induced expression of
amps correlated with a response to bacterial infection, we
next examined the ability of starved wild-type larvae to
survive bacterial challenge (fig. 6). we ﬁnd that starved
wild-type larvae are not signiﬁcantly impaired with respect
to surviving an e. coli
infection as compared with not
starved animals (p = 0.26), but are signiﬁcantly impaired
in their ability to survive m. luteus infection (p = 0.014).
the results are surprising based on the known speciﬁcity
of action of the amps on gram– and gram+ bacteria
from in vitro and in vivo studies (lemaitre et al., 1997;
tzou et al., 2002; hoffmann, 2003). the amps (attacin,
cecropin, drosocin, diptericin) that are supposed to ﬁght
gram– bacteria are largely downregulated with starvation,
yet the larvae are still resistant to e. coli infection. the
amps induced by the toll pathway (drosomycin, metch-
nikowin) are still expressed during starvation, yet
the
animals are more susceptible to m. luteus infection. this
increased susceptibility to gram+ bacterial
infection
despite activation of the toll pathway is similar to what
was seen in the ird1 mutants. these experiments suggest
that a robust amp expression in response to starvation
may be deleterious for survival during a bacterial
infection.
discussion
the unexpected discovery that ird1, a vps15 kinase, is
important
for the innate immune response is a good
example of how forward genetic screens can uncover new
functions for known genes. this kinase has been primarily
© 2006 the authors
journal compilation © 2006 blackwell publishing ltd, cellular microbiology, 9, 1073–1085
studied for its roles in endocytosis and autophagy (petiot
et al., 2000; fratti et al., 2001; futter et al., 2001; vieira
et al., 2001) because the yeast mutant phenotype indi-
cated its importance in cellular trafficking events (herman
et al., 1991; stack et al., 1995). an examination of the
mutant phenotype in a multicellular organism indicates
that this kinase also plays a key role in regulating speciﬁc
nfkb signalling pathways in the drosophila immune
response. in ird1 mutants, the imd pathway is not acti-
vated in response to bacterial infection, whereas the toll
pathway appears to be constitutively activated. this indi-
cates that ird1 may act at a nexus point for the regulation
of both pathways.
the imd and toll signalling pathways are often pre-
sented as distinct, independent pathways but this is an
oversimpliﬁed view. examinations of mutations in the
pathways indicate that the two pathways interact. muta-
tions in the toll pathway (spätzle) show higher levels of
diptericin induction (vidal et al., 2001); this suggests that
the toll pathway is negatively regulating the imd pathway
and that loss of toll signalling may result in a compensa-
tory, higher activation of the imd pathway. ird1 mutants
show a complementary effect with loss of imd pathway
and constitutive activation of the toll pathway. this may
be unique to ird1, as other imd pathway mutants do not
show constitutive activation of
the toll pathway. our
results suggest that despite the appearance of constitu-
tive signalling via the toll pathway in ird1 mutants, or
during starvation, this is actually deleterious for the ﬂy’s
immune response to bacterial
infection. recent papers
also indicate that a constitutive toll response is harmful
and causes ﬂies to be more susceptible to drosophila x
virus or listeria monocytogenes infection (gordon et al.,
2005; zambon et al., 2005). not much is known about
how the immune signalling pathways are shut off, but this
appears to be as important as activation, for the animal’s
overall immune competence.
activation and maintenance of an immune response
involves a metabolic cost to the organism. this phenom-
enon is most apparent when the immune response is
always on. in arabidopsis, mutations that constitutively
activate systemic acquired resistance (sar) result
in
much smaller plants that have reduced ﬁtness (heidel
et al., 2004). in humans, a chronic inﬂammatory response
results in metabolic adaptations to produce acute-phase
proteins at the expense of skeletal muscle (kotler, 2000).
hence, organisms need to ﬁnd a balance between using
available energy resources and mounting an adequate
immune response. in drosophila, the fat body serves both
as the primary nutrient responsive tissue and as the
primary site for amp production. the requirement for ird1
for starvation-induced amp responses and the functional
studies of its yeast and mammalian homologues indicate
that it is positioned in a nutrient-sensing pathway. our
vps15 homologue important for drosophila immunity 1081
ﬁnding that ird1 is also necessary to activate the imd
pathway and to keep the toll pathway in check indicates
that ird1 can affect both the known amp immune signal-
ling pathways. having a gene, ird1, necessary for both
nutrient sensing and immune signalling would provide a
means for the organism to quickly integrate signals from
these pathways and modulate the strength of its immune
response relative to the available energy sources. in the
future, it will be important to determine if other compo-
nents of nutrient sensing pathways can also inﬂuence the
immune signalling pathways, and whether the mamma-
lian homologue of ird1, p150, can affect nfkb immune
signalling pathways.

the
p-elements were tested for complementation of ird1 phenotypes.
all the lethal p-elements complemented the ird1 lethality. all the
non-lethal p-elements complemented the ird1 diptericin-lacz
defect. plasmid rescue or inverse pcr was used to map the
p-element insertion sites to genomic sequence (huang et al.,
2000), if the ﬂanking sequence was not known or posted by the
berkeley drosophila genome project. concurrent with the
mapping,
the following genes in the region (relish, nmdmc,
mst85c, cg11033, cg11994, cg18005, cg11990, d1,
cg9746) were sequenced in the ird1 alleles to determine
whether they might be candidates for ird1. in subsequent genetic
screens for mutations that fail to complement the lethality of ird1,
ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis was used to recover the
ird13, ird14, ird15 and ird16 alleles and hexamethylphosphoramide
mutagenesis was used to recover ird17. for epistasis analyses,
double mutants were generated by standard genetic crosses.
immune assays
l3 larvae were placed with ﬁlter paper moistened with 1%
sucrose in a sylgard-coated well of a 24-well plate. an overnight
e. coli culture was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and injected into the larvae using a microinjection needle
and holder attached to a syringe as described previously (wu
et al., 2001). for the diptericin-lacz assays, 2.5 h after e. coli
infection, larvae were dissected in 1% glutaraldehyde in pbs and
stained with b-galactosidase stain solution {0.2% x-gal in 0.01 m

at 37°c overnight.
amino acid starvation
the amino acid starvation was essentially performed as
described (scott et al., 2004). ten to 20 l3 larvae were placed
in vials with fresh yeast paste for 24 h to ensure they were well
fed before starvation. for starvation,
larvae were placed in
the sylgard-coated wells of a 24-well tissue culture dish, with
whatman ﬁlter paper soaked with 20% sucrose for 3 h. for the
reverse transcription and quantitative pcr, total rna was made
from either well-fed or starved larvae.
reverse transcription and quantitative real-time pcr
rna was isolated from l3 larvae by homogenizing larvae in
stat-60 buffer according to the manufacturer’s protocol (isotex
diagnostics). the rna was digested with rnase-free dnase,
then subjected to reverse transcription using superscript ii (invit-
rogen) and quantitative real-time pcr using either lux probes
(invitrogen) on an abi 5700 following manufacturers’ protocols.
probe sequences are available upon request. amp gene expres-
sion was normalized to rp49 levels. the different experiments
are normalized with the or+ (infected) expression set at 100% or
or uninfected set at 1. experiments were performed in triplicate
and error bars show standard deviation. one-tail t-tests were
used to assess signiﬁcant differences between samples with
p-values < 0.05 deemed signiﬁcant.
survival curves
the larvae were grown on ﬂy food, then either injected immedi-
ately with bacteria, or ﬁrst well fed with excess yeast for 24 h and
subsequently starved for 3 h in a 2% sucrose solution. for each
experiment 20 l3 larvae were injected using a pneumatic
picopump (wpi) with either pbs or a 10% washed mid-log
culture of either m. luteus or e. coli in pbs. the experiment was
performed in triplicate. larvae were placed on apple juice agar
plates to assess survival for 6 h following injection. log-rank
analyses were used to assess differences in survival curves and
p-values < 0.05 were deemed signiﬁcant.
generation of ird1 transgenic rescue ﬂies
the ird1 cdna was reconstructed from three fragments; the 5′
end was reverse transcribed from wild-type rna in two fragments
(0.7 kb, 0.9 kb) and ligated to a cdna gh20665 (2.4 kb) repre-
senting the 3′ end and inserted into puast, a transformation
vector (brand and perrimon, 1993). transgenic ﬂies expressing
the uas-ird1 were generated using p-element-mediated trans-
formation and the insertions were mapped to chromosomes
using standard drosophila crosses. uas-ird1 insertions on the
second chromosome were crossed into lines carrying either the
ird12 or ird15 mutation. the c564 gal4 driver expressing gal4 in
various immune tissues (fat body and/or lymph glands and other
tissues) (harrison et al., 1995) was crossed into either the ird12 or
ird15 genetic background so that these lines could be crossed to
the uas-ird1; ird1 lines to generate ﬂies expressing uas-ird1/
gal4 driver; ird12/ird15. the p[w+uas-ird1 pa10-68] insertion
line in the absence of a gal4 driver resulted in sufficient expres-
sion of the transgene for rescue of the ird1 phenotypes so this
was used for the rescue experiments.

fig. s1. sequence alignment of
ird1 with homologues from
other species. the ird1/vps15 gene is highly conserved through
evolution and has been identiﬁed in most eukaryotic genomes to
date. the consensus is shown on the bottom line with the kinase
region underlined and the wd40 repeat region underlined with a
wavy line. mutations identiﬁed in ird1 alleles are noted above the
aligned sequence. the alignment was performed using multalin
and the editing and shading was performed using boxshade.
some of the ird1 homologues that show intervening sequences in
highly homologous regions may be misannotated introns. ag:
