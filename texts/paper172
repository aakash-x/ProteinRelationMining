abstract—there is increasing evidence that the release of s100b protein, which is an acknowledged marker of brain
injury, is also induced by other causes including hemorrhagic shock. the aim of this study was to investigate the serum
concentration of s100b in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with various degrees of organ dysfunction but
without evidence of brain injury or any other neurological disorder and its possible association with tissue perfusion
indices. forty-six critically ill mechanically ventilated patients were studied on intensive care unit admission and until
6 days later. measurement of serum s100b protein was obtained daily at the time of laboratory sampling and blood
gas and lactate analysis. all patients exhibited increased levels of serum s100b levels at least once (median, 0.31 2g/l;
interquartile range 25%y75%, 0.17y0.68 2g/l; range 0.04y18 2g/l). there was a significant correlation between s100b
and arterial lactate (r, 0.66; p
0.001).
serum concentrations of s100b were significantly higher in the presence of hemoglobin (hb) level of less than 7 mg/dl
compared with those measured when hb level was greater than 7 mg/dl (median, 1.61 mg/dl; interquartile range
25%y75%, 0.66y3.57, vs. median, 0.29; interquartile range 25%y75%, 0.15y0.56, respectively; p
0.001). multiple
regression analysis with dependent variable s100b and independent variables lactate, hb, ph, and map showed that the
only independent variable was the lactate (r, 0.79; r2, 0.62; p
0.001). sequential organ failure assessment score was
positively associated with s100b values (p
0.05). in conclusion, serum levels of s100b protein are elevated in critically
ill patients, in the absence of an apparent brain damage. increased s100b values correlated positively with lactate levels
and negatively with map and ph. low hb level is associated with increased s100b levels. these results indicate that
serum s100b protein concentration may be related to tissue hypoperfusion.

introduction
s100b, a calcium-binding protein, first described by moore
in 1965 (1), is produced and released predominantly by glial
and schwann cells of the central nervous system (2y4). it has
been established as a specific biochemical marker
for
traumatic brain injury (5y7), even minor (7, 8), having also
an important role in outcome prediction (5, 6). in addition,
increased serum levels of s100b have also been found in
hypoxic brain damage after cardiac arrest (9, 10), in cardiac
surgery patients during (11) and after (12) cardiopulmonary
bypass, in stroke (13), and in subarachnoid hemorrhage (14).
however, there is increasing evidence that s100b release is
also induced by other causes or even originated from tissues
outside the brain (15y19). increased serum s100b levels have
been found in patients immediately after multiple trauma
without traumatic brain injury (17y19) and also in an animal
model with bone fracture without any other injury (20). most
importantly, in a recent experimental study, s100b increase
was induced by hemorrhagic shock and was associated with
the severity of shock (21). therefore, a direct damage of the
central nervous tissue as the sole source of s100b release has
been questioned. in critically ill patients with various degrees

of hypoxia, hypoperfusion, and/or multiorgan impairment
serum s100b levels have never been measured in the absence
of brain injury.
after an initial observation, in our unit, of increased serum
levels of s100b protein in patients with severe organ failure but
without brain injury, we hypothesized that hypoxia or any other
impairment of oxygen transport and/or tissue perfusion could
influence the release of s100b protein. to test this hypothesis,
we studied the serum s100b protein and the relationships
between serum s100b levels and tissue perfusion and oxygen-
ation parameters in intensive care unit (icu) patients without
actual or previous history of neurological disorder.
patients and methods
this prospective study was performed in the 30-bed multidisciplinary university
icu of a tertiary care hospital. forty-six adult patients who were consecutively
admitted to the icu, mechanically ventilated (servo 900c or 300c, siemens,
solna, sweden) because of respiratory failure of various etiologies, were included.
none of the patients had actual or previous history of brain injury or other
neurological disorder or previous investigation in a neurological department. all
patients studied were sedated with propofole 2 to 4 mg/kg per h to facilitate
patient-machine interaction during mechanical ventilation. postoperative patients
were receiving additionally remifentanyl 0.1 to 0.5 2g/kg/min. exclusion criteria
were the presence of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration because there are no
data on the kinetics of s100b protein in this condition. hematologic and
biochemical values, mechanical ventilation parameters, and chest x-ray were
recorded daily. the severity of illness of patients was daily assessed by the
sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score (22) and the severity of the lung
injury by the lung injury score (23).
all patients had an arterial catheter for monitoring of blood pressure and for
blood sampling. four milliliters of arterial blood were drawn for the measurement
of serum levels of s100b protein, blood gas, and lactate on admission and every

24 h, at the time of the routine laboratory blood sampling, for a maximum of
6 consecutive days. the study was stopped in the event of discontinuation the
mechanical ventilation, initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or
patient’s death. blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
10 min. the supernatant was separated and stored at j80
c until analysis.
for the determination of s100b, all samples were analyzed in duplicate using
a commercially available immunoluminometric assay (lia; sangtec medical,
bromma, sweden). the detection limit of this method is less than 0.02 2g/l.
for the measurement of blood gases and lactate, the samples were analyzed using
the abl 735 analyzer (radiometer; copenhagen, denmark). arterial oxygen
content was calculated according to the following equation: cao2 = sao2  hb 
1.39 + 0.0031  pao2, where cao2 (ml o2/100 ml) is arterial oxygen content, hb
is the hemoglobin content of blood (mg/dl), and sao2 (%) is the arterial
oxyhemoglobin saturation. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the
hospital, and informed consent was obtained from the patients’ close relatives.
statistical analysis
all variables were tested for normal distribution by the kolmogorov-smirnov
test. nonparametric tests were used for non-normally distributed variables.
correlations were performed by spearman correlation coefficient (r). comparisons
were made using the mann-whitney u test. differences among groups were
evaluated by using 1-way analysis of variance. when the f value was significant,
post hoc comparisons were performed using bonferroni
test. multiple linear
regression analysis was performed to identify the variables independently related to
s100b serum levels. s100b was used as dependent variable. a forward stepwise
technique was used. data are presented as mean
sd or median and percentiles.
p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. statistical calculations were
done with the statistical program for the social sciences, version 11.5 (spss,
chicago, ill).
overall, 46 patients (31 men), aged 62

the patients are shown in table 1.

of hb 7 mg/dl represents the critical threshold of hb in the
icu setting (24). similarly, s100b levels were significantly
higher in the presence of cao2 less than 10 ml/dl, which
approximately corresponds to an hb value of 7 mg/dl
compared with those measured in the presence of cao2
values greater than 10 ml/dl (p = 0.016)

and s100b levels. lactate levels were inversely correlated to
ph, hb, cao2, and map (table 2). the time course of serum
s100b concentration was variable. although a decrease in
s100b levels was observed over time, there was no significant
difference between or within patients who survived and those
who did not.
discussion
the main findings of this study are first, the increased
levels of serum s100b in almost all icu patients without an
apparent brain damage, and secondly, the association of serum
s100b with variables indicating tissue hypoperfusion as
lactate, map, ph, and low hb and arterial oxygen content.
these findings are consistent with recent studies demonstrat-
ing release of protein s100b in the absence of a direct brain
tissue injury (15y21).
the observed s100b increase could have resulted from
brain cell dysfunction and may reflect the effect of the low
amount of oxygen transported to the brain. the results of this
study could favor this suggestion because low values of map,
hb, and cao2 are associated with high s100b levels. in
addition, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and

interquartile ranges, and whiskers show ranges. the difference between
the group with lactate greater than 8 mmol/l, and the 3 other groups was
statistically significant in 1-way analysis of variance (p

sepsis, which account for a large percentage of icu patients,
may affect
the tone of both the systemic and cerebral
vasculature, and they can also increase the blood-brain barrier
permeability facilitating the diffusion of s100b into the
bloodstream (25). most importantly, fries et al (26) demon-
strated histopathologic findings of neural cell damage in the
vulnerable ca1 and ca2 subregions of the hippocampus and
increased s100b protein serum concentration in a porcine
model of acute lung injury.
a second explanation for the enhanced levels of s100b
could be the release of s100b from extra cerebral injured
tissues. although s100b protein is present in high concen-
trations in astrocytes of the central nervous system, it is also
present in low concentrations in some non-nervous tissues.
traumatized fat, muscle, and bone marrow have been
implicated in s100b increase in trauma patients in the
absence of brain injury (16y18) and also in an experimental
model with long bone fracture (19). in addition, s100b
increase may also derive from cardiac tissue, as shown by a
positive correlation between s100b and troponin i levels in a
study performed during cardiac surgery (14). however, many
of the patients in the present study with elevated serum s100b
levels were medical, without any surgical
intervention or
trauma. therefore, additional factors may contribute to this
increase. interestingly,
it has been shown recently that
exercise, such as running (27) or swimming (28), may also
increase s100b serum levels. it has been postulated that
physiological mechanisms involving the release of hormones
and excitatory neurotransmitters during exercise stimulate the
secretion of s100b by astrocytes. furthermore, an interesting
relationship between stress and s100b has been recently
observed (29). thus, the specificity of s100b as brain injury
marker has been further decreased.
four patients of the present study exhibited hemorrhagic
shock, and 2 additional patients were in refractory septic and
cardiogenic shock, respectively, at the time of blood sam-
pling. in these patients, the highest levels of s100b (range,

2.39y18 2g/l) were measured. this observation is in accor-
dance with a recent experimental study that hemorrhagic shock
induces s100b increase possibly attributed to an ongoing brain
damage because of a decrease in cerebral perfusion (20). s100b
has a short half-life of less than 1 h, and therefore, it could be
eliminated soon after the resuscitation. in fact, 2 patients who
were admitted to the icu postoperatively, after a restored
hemorrhagic shock, had a moderate elevation of s100b (0.34
and 0.59 2g/l). because this is the first time of measurement of
serum s100b in critically ill patients without brain injury, more
data in humans with hemorrhagic or other type of shock are
lacking at the present time.
a striking correlation between s100b and lactate was
demonstrated in the present study. this finding extends the
observation that s100b increase is associated with the severity
of shock in the experimental study of pelinka et al. (20); in their
experiment, although lactate levels were elevated, a correla-
tion between s100b and lactate was not tested. on the other
hand, it has been shown in vitro specific, dose-dependent,
swelling-inducing properties of lactic acid in glial cells (30, 31)
which might in turn stimulate astrocytes to release s100b. on
the contrary, it has been recently shown that experimental
local ischemia and reperfusion of the liver, gut, and kidney
cause an s100b increase per se, suggesting the induction of
s100b release in extracranial tissue and further limiting the
specificity of s100b as a marker of brain damage (32).
the clinical implication of the correlation of s100b with
lactate, map, and ph may have specific significance in
trauma patients in whom brain injury often coexists with
hemorrhagic shock and increased lactate. the results of the
present study may underline the importance of considering
concomitant tissue hypoperfusion when increased concentra-
tion of serum s100b protein is evaluated in these patients.
in as much as s100b is primarily metabolized in the kidney
(33, 34), the elevated s100b levels could be the result of
decreased renal excretion. however, we found no correlation
between serum creatinine and s100b levels. there are no data
for s100b kinetics in hemodialysis or hemofiltration. s100b
has a low molecular weight (21 kda) (2) and theoretically,
could be removed through the filter. indeed, high-volume
plasmapheresis reduced s100b levels in patients with fulmi-
nant hepatic failure (35). therefore, in the present study, we
excluded the icu patients with continuous veno-venous
hemofiltration to avoid falsely lowered s100b levels.
the present study has certain limitations that must be
addressed. first, although all patients with brain injury have
been excluded, we assessed the level of consciousness by the
glasgow coma scale, 1 of the 6 components of sofa score.
however, in many critically ill patients, the glasgow coma
scale is estimated under sedation and mechanical ventilation;
therefore, it is a rough measurement of the level of conscious-
ness. nevertheless, all patients were alert before intubation
and mechanical ventilation, and none of the survivors had any
neurological sequelae after arousal and weaning from
mechanical ventilation. second, in the analysis, more than 1
observation per patient have been used. however, the results
obtained by using both 1 measurement per patient, on icu
admission, and by using the subject means were similar to
those found for all data, confirming the significant correlation
between s100b and the other variables.
in conclusion, serum s100b concentrations are frequently
elevated among critically ill patients in the icu without
obvious brain tissue damage. increased lactate levels, and low
arterial pressure, ph, and hb levels seem to influence s100b
synthesis and/or release. further research should determine
the sources and address the mechanisms of this s100b
increase and evaluate its significance as a possible marker of
tissue hypoperfusion in the icu setting.
