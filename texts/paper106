expanded polyglutamine 72 repeat (polyq72) aggregates induce endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress-mediated cell death with
caspase-12 activation and vesicular formation (autophagy). we examined this relationship and the molecular mechanism
of autophagy formation. rapamycin, a stimulator of autophagy, inhibited the polyq72-induced cell death with caspase-12
activation. polyq72, but not polyq11, stimulated atg5-atg12-atg16 complex-dependent microtubule-associated protein 1 (map1)
light chain 3 (lc3) conversion from lc3-i to -ii, which plays a key role in autophagy. the eucaryotic translation initiation factor 2 a
(eif2a) a/a mutation, a knock-in to replace a phosphorylatable ser51 with ala51, and dominant-negative perk inhibited polyq72-
induced lc3 conversion. polyq72 as well as er stress stimulators upregulated atg12 mrna and proteins via eif2a
phosphorylation. furthermore, atg5 deﬁciency as well as the eif2a a/a mutation increased the number of cells showing polyq72
aggregates and polyq72-induced caspase-12 activation. thus, autophagy formation is a cellular defense mechanism against
polyq72-induced er-stress-mediated cell death by degrading polyq72 aggregates, with perk/eif2a phosphorylation being
involved in polyq72-induced lc3 conversion.

an autophagic pathway is a cellular defense process involving
the bulk degradation of cellular contents by autophagosomes/
lysosomes during starvation or viral infection.1 however, over
production of autophagic vesicles interferes with normal
membrane trafﬁcking in the cell and causes autophagic cell
death with the degradation of cellular organs. these
autophagic vesicles are also shown during neurodegenera-
tion such as huntington disease (hd) with expanded
polyglutamine (polyq) aggregation and parkinson’s disease
with a-synuclein aggregation.2,3
the molecular mechanism of autophagy has been inves-
tigated in yeast and mammalian cells.4,5 the atg5-dependent
conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 (map1) light
chain 3 (lc3), the mammalian homolog of atg8, from lc3-i
(free form) to lc3-ii (membrane-bound form) is a key step in
the induction of autophagy in mammalian cells.5,6 prolc3 is
processed to lc3-i by cleavage at the c-terminal region7
immediately after synthesis, and then lc3-i is targeted to the
isolated membrane (lc3-ii), dependent on the atg5–atg12
complex throughout the course of membrane elongation.5,8
atg16 homo-oligomers crosslink multiple atg5–atg12 con-
jugates to form atg5–atg12–atg16 complex.9 during these
processes, lc3-i and atg12 are activated by atg7.
recently, an atg7-deﬁcient mouse model showed the
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and abnormal cellular
organs in the liver.10 these results strongly suggest that
autophagy as well as the ubiquitin/proteasome system is
involved in protein degradation in addition to the degradation
of cellular organs. rapamycin (rap), which stimulates
autophagy,11 attenuates polyq aggregate formation and
decreases polyq toxicity in cell and mouse models of
hd.12,13 this suggests that autophagy seems to contribute
to the cellular defense system, by degrading malfolded protein
aggregates, as well as cellular dysfunction. however, little is
known about the activation of the autophagic pathway in cells
expressing malfolded protein aggregates.
the relationship between the intracellular aggregation of
malfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress
has been intensively examined.14 excess amounts of
unfolded or malfolded proteins in the er are retrotranslocated
to the cytoplasm and degraded by the er-associated
ubiquitine/proteasome degradation (erad) system.15 how-
ever,
the amount of unfolded and malfolded proteins
exceeds the capacity of the erad system, the proteins start
to aggregate in the er and trigger er-stress-mediated cell
death with caspase-12 activation, a caspase speciﬁcally

localized at er.16,17 the cytoplasmic aggregates of malfolded
proteins such as polyq also stimulate er stress signals and
induce er-stress-mediated cell death with caspase-12
activation in mouse cells, presumably by the accumulation
of unfolded proteins in the er due to the inhibition of erad
and retrotranslocation.18,19
here, we show that rap inhibits the polyq-induced er-
stress-mediated cell death with caspase-12 activation. these
results strongly suggest
the close relationship between
autophagy formation and er stress signals in cells expressing
cytoplasmic polyq aggregates.
in the present study, we
used the expanded polyglutamine 72 repeat (polyq72) and
examined the relationship between degradation of intracel-
lular aggregation of malfolded proteins by autophagy and er
stress signals.
results
rap inhibits polyq-induced er-stress-mediated cell
death. polyq72 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in c2c5
cells 48 h after transfection of pegfp (green ﬂuorescent
protein)-72cag and induces er-stress-mediated cell death
with caspase-12 activation during aggregation, while
polyq11 does not form aggregates nor induce the caspase-
12 activation.18 to clarify the relation between autophagy
and er-stress-mediated cell death in cells showing polyq72
aggregates, we examined the effect of rap, a stimulator of
autophagy, and 3-methyladenine (3ma), an inhibitor of
autophagy, on polyq72-induced caspase-12 activation and
dna fragmentation. rap decreased the amount of insoluble
polyq72 and inhibited caspase-12 activation, about 50%
decrease of the amount of the active form fragment, and
dna fragmentation, whereas 3ma increased the amount of
insoluble polyq72 and stimulated caspase-12 activation,
about 2.0-fold increase of the amount of the active form
fragment, and dna fragmentation (figure 1a).

1b and c). however, 3ma did not stimulate polyq11
aggregation and did not induce caspase-12 activation and
dna fragmentation in cells expressing polyq11 (figure 1a–c).
these results suggest that autophagy formation is involved in
the inhibition of er-stress-mediated cell death by degrading
polyq72 aggregates.
polyq-induced atg5-dependent lc3 conversion. poly-
q72 induced the conversion of lc3-i (18 kda) to -ii (16 kda),
a key molecule involved in autophagosome formation, in
c2c5 cells, but polyq11 did not (figure 2a). deﬁciency of
atg5, a key molecule in the conversion of lc3-i
to -ii,
inhibited the polyq72-induced lc3 conversion (figure 2b).
during autophagosome formation, lc3-i was converted to
lc3-ii, which is tightly associated with the autophagosomal
membrane. lc3-i
is diffusely stained by anti-lc3 in the
cytoplasm of cells with no stress, while lc3-ii shows bright

ased ﬂuorescence intensity.7,20,21 anti-lc3-positive granules

the polyq72-induced atg5-

inducers, such as tunicamycin (tm), brefeldin a (bre), and
thapsigargin (thap), as well as starvation, also induced lc3

polyq72 aggregates-induced lc3 conversion with
lysosomal turnover of lc3-ii. a cellular level of lc3-ii
does not always show the stimulation of lc3 conversion
because autophagosomal lc3-ii is degraded by lysosomal
hydrolases after formation of autolysosomes; the inhibition of
the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome as well as the
stimulation of lc3 conversion increases the level of lc3-ii.
lc3-ii signiﬁcantly accumulates in the presence of e64d, a
membrane-permeable inhibitor of cathepsins b, h, and l,
and pepstatin a, an inhibitor of cathepsins d and e, under
starvation conditions.23 lysosomal turnover of lc3-ii reﬂects
autophagic activity. we examined the effect of e64d and
pepstatin a on the level of polyq72 and the polyq72-induced
lc3-ii. the polyq72, but not polyq11, accumulated in the
insoluble
also
accumulated (figure 3a). e64d and pepstatin a increased
the number of cells showing polyq72 aggregates, however,
did not stimulate polyq11 aggregation (figure 3b and c). the
increased level of lc3-ii induced by polyq72 was due to the
stimulation of the lc3 conversion but not due to the inhibition
the fusion of autophagosome with lysosome. thus,
of
polyq72 and polyq72-induced lc3-ii
in the autopha-
gosome were degraded in the autolysosome. the cells
degradated polyq72 aggregates in the autolysosome by
promoting the lc3 conversion and increasing the autophagic
activity.

these process.5,8,9 on the other hand, er stress regulates

in contrast with atg5, atg7, and atg16

polyq72 and their upregulation was inhibited by eif2aa/a

(figure 6a, c and d), and increased the amount of insoluble
polyq72 and stimulated caspase-12 activation although it did
not affect the amount of eif2a phosphorylation and chop

with caspase-12 was almost the same, about 30%, in the
atg5þ /þ cells and atg5 /  cells showing polyq72 aggre-
gates; caspase-12 was activated in 32.972.1% of atg5þ /þ
cells and 29.274.3% of atg5 /  cells showing polyq72
aggregates (figure 6e).
thus, atg5–atg12–atg16 complex-dependent lc3 conver-
sion inhibited er-stress-mediated cell death with caspase-12
activation in cells expressing polyq72. these results suggest
that atg5–atg12–atg16 complex-dependent lc3 conversion,
leading to autophagy,
inhibit polyq72-induced er-stress-
mediated cell death with caspase-12 activation by degrading
cytoplasmic polyq72 aggregates (figure 7).

however, it is not yet clear how autophagy recognizes
malfolded protein aggregates. atg7-deﬁcient mice show
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the liver,10 strongly
suggesting that autophagy as well as the ubiquitin/protea-
some system is involved in the degradation of ubiquitinated
proteins. polyq aggregates show antiubiquitin immunoreac-
tivity30 and that atg5 deﬁciency stimulates the accumulation
of polyq72 aggregates. autophagy may preferentially
degrade aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins rather than
soluble nonubiquitinated proteins. the ubiquitination state

the protein aggregate may be a possible
determinant for selective protein degradation by autophagy.

response signal, plays an essential role in polyq72-induced
lc3 conversion.
the relationship between autophagy and eif2a phosphory-
lation has been shown during starvation-induced autophagy
in saccharomyces cerevisiae and during starvation- and
virus-induced autophagy in mammalian cells.31 in yeast,
starvation results in the accumulation of uncharged trnas to
recently,
activate gcn2, the sole eif2a kinase. in mammals, there
are at least four eif2a kinases including gcn2, pkr, perk,
and hri, which are activated by amino acid starvation, viral
infection, er stress, and heme depletion, respectively.32
virus induces autophagy via activation of pkr. thus, it is
possible that various stress conditions, including er stress,
that activate eif2a kinases may have an ability to induce
autophagy in mammalian cells by stimulating lc3 conversion.
it has been postulated the possibility that
inhibition of mtor, a mammalian target of rap, induces
autophagy and reduces the toxicity of polyq expansions.13
rap fails to induce eif2a phosphorylation in yeast with gcn2
defective in trna binding.33 in contrast with polyq72-induced
lc3 conversion, rap- as well as starvation-induced lc3
conversion was not mediated by perk/eif2a pathway (see
supplemental figure 2). inhibition of mtor-mediated eif2a
phosphorylation may be an alternative pathway by which
polyq aggregates induce autophagy. rap inhibits the er-
stress-mediated cell death (unpublished observation) but
stimulates the starvation-induced autophagic cell death.34
thus, eif2a phosphorylation does not inhibit the all types of
stress-induced cell death.
the possible molecular mechanism of eif2a phos-
phorylation inducing lc3 conversion. the molecular
mechanism, by which eif2a phosphorylation regulates lc3
conversion is not yet clear. eif2a phosphorylation blocks the
binding of initiator met-trna to the ribosome by inhibiting the
turnover of eif2b and represses translation of most mrnas.

a/a mutation increased the number of cells showing polyq72

caspase-12 activation (figure 5), but did not increase the
population of cells with caspase-12 activation in cells showing

phosphorylation preferentially stimulates the lc3 conversion
and the degradation of polyq72 aggregates to inhibit the
polyq72 aggregates-induced cell death rather
than the
pathway inhibiting the caspase-12 activation.
very recently, the accumulated mutant a1-antitrypsin z
inhibitors in the er has been shown to be degraded by
autophagy.41 we have also found that atg5–atg12-atg16
complex-dependent lc3 conversion inhibits the accumulation
of
the mutated dysferlin in er (fujita et al., submitted
elsewhere). these results suggest the possibility that auto-
phagye/lysosome as well as ubiquitine/proteasome is involved
not only in the degradation of cytoplasmic protein aggregates
such as polyq aggregates but also in the degradation of the
misfolded and unfolded er protein in the er as one of the
erad degradation system to inhibit the er-stress-mediated
cell death. this possibility remains to be studied.
recently,
it has been shown that
interaction between
antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 and the autophagy protein,
beclin-1, homolog of atg6, represents a potentially important
point of convergence of
the apoptotic and autophagic
machinery.42–44 dissociated beclin-1 from bcl-2 mediates
the localization of other autophagy proteins to the preauto-
phagosomal membrane and participates in autophagosome
formation.45,46 thap increased the level of beclin-1 protein
and its dissociation from bcl-2 (unpublished observation).
er-stress-induced dissociation of the beclin-1 and bcl-2 may
also play a role in the regulation of the er-stress-mediated
apoptotic cell death and autophagic formation.
conclusion
the scheme in figure 7 shows the possible molecular
mechanism of polyq72- and er-stress-induced lc3 conver-
sion, lc3-i to -ii, via activation of the perk/eif2a pathway.
atg5–atg12–atg16 complex-dependent lc3 conversion,
the perk/eif2a
which is stimulated by the activation of
pathway in cells showing polyq72 aggregates, is the cellular
defense system that inhibits er-stress-mediated cell death by
degrading polyq72 aggregates. isolated membrane from the
er membrane may be elongated into an autophagosome by
lc3-ii activated by eif2a phosphorylation.

figure 7 involvement of eif2a phosphorylation in malfolded protein polyq72-
induced lc3 conversion. polyq72 aggregates induce er stress by inhibiting the
retrotranslocation and/or erad activity.19 the accumulation of malfolded proteins in
the er induces perk/eif2a phosphorylation, which induces lc3 conversion via
upregulation of atg12 and probably activation of atg5–atg12–atg16 complex and
stimulates autophagy degrading the polyq72 aggregates. when lc3 conversion is

chop. atg12, a component of atg5–atg12–atg16 complex,
as well as chop mrna was selectively upregulated by
polyq72 via eif2a phosphorylation (figure 4a). thus, one

increase the upregulation of atg12,

lation of eif2a inhibits er-stress-induced caspase-12
activation and er-stress-mediated cells death.37,38 cells
with phosphorylated eif2a are resistant to oxidative stress39
and inhibition of eif2a dephosphorylation promotes survival
of stressed cells.40 atg5 deﬁciency did not
inhibit thap-
induced caspase-12 activation (supplemental figure 3).
moreover, rap inhibits the thap-induced caspase-12
activation
(unpublished
observation), suggesting that eif2a phosphorylation may
inhibits thap-induced cell death via preferentially inhibiting
the caspase-12 activation. thus, it may be possible that rap
inhibits the polyq72-induced cell death by both pathways;
stimulation of autophagy and inhibition of caspase-12
activation.
