bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis and have
recently been shown to modulate autophagy. the tumor sup-
pressor beclin 1 has been proposed to coordinate both apoptosis
and autophagy through direct interaction with anti-apoptotic
family members bcl-2 and/or bcl-xl. however, the molecular
basis for this interaction remains enigmatic. here we report that
beclin 1 contains a conserved bh3 domain, which is both nec-
essary and sufficient for its interaction with bcl-xl. we also
report the crystal structure of a beclin bh3 peptide in complex
withbcl-xlat2.5a˚ resolution.reminiscentofpreviouslydeter-
mined bcl-xl-bh3 structures, the amphipathic bh3 helix of
beclin 1 bound to a conserved hydrophobic groove of bcl-xl.
these results define beclin 1 as a novel bh3-only protein,
implying that beclin 1 may have a direct role in initiating apo-
ptotic signaling. we propose that this putative apoptotic func-
tion may be linked to the ability of beclin 1 to suppress tumor
formation in mammals.
programmed cell death (1) is a critical process in metazoans
responsible for basic tissue homeostasis, selective elimination
of damaged cells, and structural reorganization during develop-
ment. apoptosis, the most clearly defined form of programmed
cell death, is initiated by an array of intracellular and extracel-
lular signals (e.g. dna damage, cytokine removal, anoikis, etc.)
and is characterized by a canonical morphology exhibiting
chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and mem-
brane blebbing (2, 3). the molecular mechanisms responsible
for this morphology involve the release of cytochrome c and
other apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria, and the sub-
sequent activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases
that dismantle the cell in a precise and systematic manner
(4–6). the bcl-2 family of proteins integrate apoptotic signal
transduction upstream of and at the mitochondrial membrane
(7, 8). three classes of bcl-2 family proteins have been exten-
sively described in the literature: anti-apoptotic bcl-2-like pro-
teins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, bcl-w, and mcl-1, a1) containing three or
four bcl-2 homology (bh)2 domains; pro-apoptotic bax-like

2 the abbreviations used are: bh, bcl-2 homology; bcl-2bd, beclin 1 bcl-2
proteins (bax, bak, and bok) containing bh1, -2, and -3
domains; and pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins (e.g. bim, bad,
bid, puma, and noxa) containing only the bh3 domain. upon
receipt of an apoptotic stimulus, bh3-only proteins are then
“activated,” repress anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members, and
activate pro-apoptotic bax-like proteins via direct protein-pro-
tein interaction (9–11). this leads to oligomerization of bax
and bak at the mitochondrial membrane, release of cytochrome
c, and subsequent activation of caspases. thus, bh3-only
proteins form a family of critical cell death ligands, which
initiate a canonical death pathway and the resultant apopto-
tic morphology.
autophagy, a highly conserved stress response, may function
as an alternative, non-apoptotic death mechanism under cer-
tain conditions, for which it is sometimes referred to as type ii
programmed cell death (12–14). under most conditions, auto-
phagy is thought to function as a catabolic recycling mechanism
involving the sequestration of cytoplasm and/or entire
organelles into double-membraned vacuoles, termed autopha-
gosomes, and their subsequent delivery to the lytic compart-
ment (15). this type of autophagy, termed macroautophagy,
functions to facilitate bioenergetic buffering during metabolic
stress and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles (15).
during nutrient limitation, autophagy serves as a survival
mechanism, maintaining a reserve of macromolecular building
blocks and atp in both wild-type (16) and transformed (17, 18)
cells.
interestingly, abnormal induction of autophagic vacuoles, a
signature of type ii programmed cell death, has been observed
in dying cells from many diverse species (12, 19), which has led
some to believe that autophagy may have a direct role in such a
death process. consistent with this hypothesis, molecular evi-
dence for autophagy-dependent cell death has recently been
observed in mouse l929 cells treated with the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-vad-fmk (20) and apoptosis-deficient bax⫺/⫺,
bak⫺/⫺ mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with etoposide or
staurosporine (21). in both cases, rna interference directed
toward components of the general autophagy machinery
reverses the death phenotype. these studies bolster the notion
that autophagy, an intrinsically self-limiting process, can, at
least in some situations, act as a bona fide cell death program.
additionally, bcl-2 itself has been shown to directly inhibit
autophagic cell death via interaction with the mammalian auto-
phagy gene beclin 1, demonstrating functional cross-talk
binding domain; itc, isothermal titration calorimetry; gst, glutathione
s-transferase; rh, hydrodynamic radius; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, flu-
oromethyl ketone.

structure of bcl-xl-beclin peptide complex
between the apoptotic and autophagic pathways (22). beclin 1,
the first identified mammalian autophagy protein (23), can
function as a tumor suppressor in mammals (24–26) and inter-
acts with the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family proteins bcl-2 and
bcl-xl but not bax (22, 27, 28). a litany of human cell lines, each
expressing a mutant beclin 1 deficient in binding to bcl-2, all
display increased levels of type ii cell death, which is suppressed
by small interfering rna of the essential autophagy gene atg5
(22). these results suggest that bcl-2, in addition to its hallmark
ability to block type i-programmed cell death, can also block
type ii-programmed cell death, perhaps multiplying its onco-
genic potential (22, 29). they also imply that anti-apoptotic
bcl-2 family members, acting upstream of beclin 1, may serve as
master cell death regulators, able to coordinate both apoptotic
and autophagic signals.
however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of autophagy by bcl-2 family proteins remain poorly
understood. for example, it is unclear how beclin 1 interacts
with bcl-xl or bcl-2. such lack of mechanistic understanding is
further confounded by unpredictable cell biology observations.
for example, overexpression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl in wild-type
mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with etoposide appears to
stimulate, rather than inhibit, beclin 1-dependent autophagic
cell death (21). the cause of this reversal of phenotype in the
presence of an apoptotic stimulus remains unclear (22).
to gain further insight into the regulation of beclin 1 by bcl-2
family proteins, we have performed biochemical experiments
using purified proteins. in this study, we have defined the min-
imal interaction domains between bcl-xl and beclin 1. we
have discovered that beclin 1 contains a conserved bh3 domain
and determined the crystal structure of the beclin 1 bh3 pep-
tide in complex with bcl-xl. the structure, combined with in
vitro binding analysis, reveals that the beclin 1 bh3 domain is
both necessary and sufficient for interaction with the hydro-
phobic groove of bcl-xl and proves that beclin 1 is an authentic
bh3-only protein. the classification of beclin 1 as a bh3-only
family member implies that, at least under certain circum-
stances, beclin 1 may act upstream of bcl-2, mediating a cryptic
apoptotic signaling function. we speculate that this putative
pro-apoptotic function may partially explain the ability of
beclin 1 to suppress tumor formation in mammals.
experimental procedures
expression and purification of proteins—the beclin 1 cdna
was generously provided by dr. dan klionsky (university of
michigan). all constructs were generated using a standard
pcr-based cloning strategy and confirmed by sequencing. the
bcl-2 binding domain of human beclin 1 (bcl-2bd, residues
86–158) as well the human beclin 1 bh3 domain (beclinbh3,
residues 107–135) were expressed as n-terminal glutathione
s-transferase (gst) fusions from the vector pgex-2t (phar-
macia corporation). human bcl-xl⌬loop⌬tm (deletion of
residues 27–82 and the c-terminal 24 residues) was cloned into
prsf (novagen) and coexpressed with gst-beclinbh3 in
escherichia coli strain bl21 (de3) at 15 °c. the soluble fraction
of the e. coli lysate was passed over a glutathione-sepharose 4b
(amersham biosciences) affinity column, and the beclinbh3-
bcl-xl complex was cleaved from the column using thrombin.
the complex was then further purified using ion exchange
(source 15q, amersham biosciences) and size exclusion
(superdex-200, amersham biosciences) chromatography.
wild-type and mutant gst-bcl-2bd were expressed individu-
ally at room temperature and purified using a similar purifica-
tion procedure, except that intact gst fusions were eluted
from the affinity resin using reduced glutathione. a variant of
bcl-xl⌬tm (n52d,n66d) was expressed as a c-terminal his6
fusion from pet29b (novagen) and purified to homogeneity
using affinity

exchange (source 15q), and size exclusion (superdex-200)

crystallization and data collection—beclinbh3-bcl-xl co-
crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 22 °c by
mixing equal volumes of protein (5 mg/ml) with a well buffer
containing 19–24% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m hepes, ph
7.5, and 0.2 m tri-sodium citrate dihydrate. crystals appeared
overnight and were harvested after 10 days of maturation. the
crystals belong to the space group p21212 and contain two
domain-swapped dimers (four complexes) per asymmetric
unit. the unit cell dimensions are a ⫽ 107.94 å, b ⫽ 110.59 å,
and c ⫽ 100.52 å. crystals were equilibrated in a cryopro-
tectant buffer containing 15% glycerol (v/v) plus well buffer and
flash frozen in a ⫺170 °c nitrogen stream. native data were
collected at national synchrotron light source beamline x-25
and processed using denzo and scalepack software (30).
structural determination—the structure was determined by
molecular replacement using the program phaser (31) and
coordinates from the bim-bcl-xl crystal structure (accession
code 1pq1), excluding the bim peptide. the atomic model was
built using o (32) and refined using crystallography nmr soft-
ware (33). weak non-crystallography symmetry restraints
(5–15 kcal/mol) were used in refinement. electron density for
the beclin 1 peptide and the domain-swapped helices were
unambiguous after preliminary refinement. the final, refined
atomic model contains residues 107–127 of human beclin 1
and residues 2–198 of human bcl-xl with amino acids 26 and
83 contiguous. the beclin 1 peptide contains two additional
n-terminal residues (gly and ser) carried over from the throm-
bin cleavage site of pgex-2t.
gst-mediated pulldown assay—1 mg of wild-type or
mutant gst-bcl-2bd protein was immobilized on a 0.3-ml glu-
tathione s-sepharose 4b column and washed with 20 column
volumes of buffer a (25 mm tris, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 3 mm
dithiothreitol) to remove unbound protein. 2 mg of bcl-
xl⌬tm was then bound to the resin followed by two 10-col-
umn volume washes with buffer a. bound proteins were eluted
with buffer a plus 5 mm reduced glutathione, applied to sds-
page, and visualized by staining with coomassie blue.
isothermal titration calorimetry (itc)—wild-type or
mutant bcl-2bd or a synthetic peptide identical to the
beclinbh3 peptide used for crystallization was titrated into the
reaction cell of a vp-itc microcalorimeter (microcal) con-
taining 20 ␮m bcl-xl⌬tm. the sequence of the synthetic pep-

the beclin 1 bh3 (beclinbh3)

using a similar
searched for homology to other
bcl-2 homology domains
(bh1,
bh2, and bh3) but were unable to
identify any significant similarity to
such sequences. the presence of a bh3 domain, and only a bh3
domain, defines beclin 1 as a novel member of the bh3-only
family of proteins.
mutations in beclinbh3 helical contacts disrupt binding
to bcl-xl—to show that the putative beclinbh3 is required for
the interaction with pro-survival bcl-2 family members, several
conserved bh3 residues (leu-116, thr-119, and gly-120) were
individually mutated to glutamate, and the resulting mutant
proteins were assayed for their ability to bind to bcl-xl.
because of the poor solubility of full-length beclin 1, bcl-2bd
was used for these experiments. two assays, gst-mediated
pulldown (fig. 2a) and analytical gel filtration (fig. 2b), consis-
tently demonstrated that the missense mutations l116e or
g120e led to abrogation of the interaction between beclin 1
and bcl-xl. a double mutant containing both the l116e and
g120e mutations similarly lost binding to bcl-xl. in contrast,
the mutant t119e appeared to retain some binding to bcl-xl in
both assays.
next, we determined the binding affinities using itc, in
which various beclin 1 mutants (bcl-2bd) were titrated into a
sample chamber containing bcl-xl protein. this analysis
revealed an apparent binding affinity of 2.3 ␮m between wild-
type beclin 1 and bcl-xl (fig. 2c, left panel). a similar binding
affinity, 1.1 ␮m, was attained using a synthetic beclinbh3 pep-
tide (fig. 2d), suggesting that the extra sequences flanking the
bh3 domain in bcl-2bd do not make any significant contribu-
tion to bcl-xl binding. consistent with the pulldown and gel
filtration assays, no interaction with bcl-xl was observed for
the mutant beclin 1 bcl-2bd-l116e (fig. 2c, middle panel).
furthermore, in agreement with the observation that the beclin
1 mutant t119e retained some binding to bcl-xl in the pull-
down and gel filtration assays (fig. 2, a and b), t119e exhibited
a decreased binding affinity (14.8 ␮m) for bcl-xl by itc (fig.
2c, right panel). these results demonstrate that the beclinbh3

laboratories). for all analyses, n was forced to equal 1, and the
initial ligand concentration (bcl-2bd) was varied until a best fit
was achieved. this operation was necessary, because the initial
concentration of bcl-2bd could not be determined spectro-
scopically due to a lack of uv light-absorbing amino acids (trp
or tyr). bcl-xl concentrations were determined by absorbance
at 280 nm.
dynamic light-scattering and gel filtration analysis—dy-
namic light-scattering data were collected on a wyatt technol-
ogies minidawn instrument at 23 °c. all samples were
diluted to 2 mg/ml in buffer a and passed through a 0.1-␮m
filter to remove particulate matter. analytical gel filtration was
performed using a superdex-200 size exclusion column. for
interaction assays between bcl-xl⌬tm and beclin bcl-2bd,
proteins were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio, respectively, and
injected onto a superdex-200 size exclusion column equili-
brated with buffer a. the elution profile of bcl-xl⌬tm was
monitored at 280 nm. in control experiments, the elution pro-
file of wild-type and mutant beclin bcl-2bd proteins were
determined by monitoring phenylalanine at 254 nm.
results
beclin 1 contains a conserved bh3 domain—previous stud-
ies have identified amino acids 88–150 of beclin 1 as the min-
imal bcl-2 binding domain (bcl-2bd) (22, 27). bcl-2bd was
shown to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with bcl-
2/bcl-xl both in vivo and in vitro (22, 27, 28). the only surface
on anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family proteins known to mediate pro-
tein-protein interactions is a conserved hydrophobic groove
responsible for binding the bh3 helix of bh3-only proteins
(34–36). therefore, we postulated that beclin 1 may contain a
bh3 domain. by performing primary sequence alignments
between an array of bh3 domains from known bcl-2 family
members and bcl-2bd, we were able to identify a putative bh3

domain itself is specifically required for the interaction
between beclin 1 and bcl-xl in vitro. they also demonstrate
that the bh3 domain of beclin 1 can form a “stable” complex
with bcl-xl.
a beclin missense mutant, f123a in human beclin 1, has
recently been shown to disrupt binding to bcl-2 in vivo (22).
this mutation serendipitously maps to the c terminus of the
bh3 helix in beclin 1 (fig. 1b). yeast two-hybrid analysis and
immunoprecipitation experiments in hek293 cells suggest
that this mutation disrupts the interaction between beclin 1
and cellular bcl-2 (22). based on the bim and bad peptide struc-
tures, the benzene ring of this phenylalanine makes critical van
der waals contacts with amino acids in the conserved groove of
bcl-xl. these contacts are predicted to be significantly weak-
ened or disrupted by mutation of phe to the much smaller ala.
these results are consistent with our in vitro observations and
suggest that the beclinbh3 domain is responsible for interac-
tion with bcl-2 family proteins in vivo in the context of a full-
length protein. thus, the bh3 domain of beclin 1 is the minimal
element necessary for interaction with anti-apoptotic bcl-2
family proteins both in vitro and in vivo.
overall structure of the bcl-xl-beclinbh3 heterodimer—
bh3 domains may have been misidentified in a number of pro-
teins (37) presumably because of the low complexity of the con-
sensus sequence. this prompted us to examine the interaction
between the beclinbh3 domain and bcl-xl in more detail.
accordingly, we co-crystallized a heterodimeric complex con-
taining a beclinbh3 peptide (hbeclin-(107–135)) and a dele-
tion variant of bcl-xl (bcl-xl⌬loop⌬tm; see “experimental
procedures”). the structure was determined at a 2.5 å resolu-
tion by molecular replacement using the bcl-xl-bim structure
(table 1).
unexpectedly, the heterodimer crystallized as a domain-
swapped tetramer, with each bcl-xl monomer bound to an inde-
pendent beclinbh3 peptide and each bcl-xl helix ␣1 intermo-
lecularly “swapped” with its neighbor (fig. 3a). two lines of

123, mediate important interactions
with surrounding residues in bcl-xl
(fig. 4a). the corresponding resi-
dues in bimbh3 are ile-90, leu-94,
arg-95, ile-97, gly-98, asp-99, and
phe-101, respectively (fig. 4b). the
interactions mediated by the two
charged residues, lys-117 and asp-
121 in beclin 1, are highly con-
served. in both beclin 1 and bim, the
positively charged lys-117/arg-95
donates
a hydrogen bond to
glu-129 in bcl-xl. this interaction
is stabilized by a pair of intramolec-
ular contacts between glu-129 and
arg-132 (fig. 4). the invariant asp-
121/asp-99 in beclin/bim make a
pair of charge-stabilized hydrogen
bonds to arg-139 of bcl-xl. in con-
trast to the two charged residues,
interactions mediated by the four
hydrophobic residues in beclin 1
exhibit distinct features compared
with those in the bcl-xl-bim com-
plex (fig. 4). one major difference is
that the ␣3 helix in the beclinbh3-
bound bcl-xl appears to be more
flexible, as judged by the high tem-
perature factors
(b-factors) and
poor
electron density. conse-
quently, leu-112 in beclin 1 makes
van der waals contacts to tyr-101
(but not leu-108) in bcl-xl (fig.
4a), whereas the corresponding res-
idue ile-90 in bim interacts with
leu-108 (but not tyr-101). simi-
larly, leu-116 in beclin 1 interacts
with tyr-101 and leu-108 (but not
phe-105) in bcl-xl, whereas leu-94
in bim makes contact to phe-105
(but not tyr-101 or leu-108). apparently, these interaction
features determine the distinct binding specificity of beclin 1
toward bcl-xl and perhaps other bcl-2 family proteins.
a comparison of the crystal structure of unbound bcl-xl
with the beclinbh3-bcl-xl complex reveals similar structural
rearrangements as seen in the bim complex. upon binding of
the bh3 ligand, the ␣4 helix of bcl-xl shifts toward the peptide
by ⬃4 å, whereas ␣3 opens up 4–5 å (fig. 5). the increased
mobility of helix ␣3 in the beclin complex is likely the result of
bh3 peptide binding, as ␣3 also shows generally higher b-fac-
tors than other helices in the bim peptide structure (36) but has
normal b-factors in all available apobcl-xl structures. in addi-
tion to this increased mobility, the side chain of tyr-101 on
helix ␣2, which lines the binding groove, is flipped with respect
to the bim-bcl-xl structure (fig. 5). we note that the confor-
mation of this residue is particularly diverse, as it varies among
both apobcl-xl (compare accessions 1rd2 and 1maz) and
holobcl-xl (fig. 5). it is possible that the orientation of tyr-101

hydrophobic groove created by ␣2–␣5 provides the docking
surface for the bh3 peptide (fig. 3c). the peptide adopts a
single, six-turn, ␣-helix with bh3 residues leu-112, leu-116,
thr-119, gly-120, phe-123, and the aliphatic side chains of ser-
113 and arg-115 forming a network of van der waals interac-
tions with the bcl-xl groove (fig. 3c). several flanking hydro-
gen bonds stabilize the interaction and may provide the
necessary specificity to orient the helix (fig. 3c).

tinct from those of the bcl-xl-bim recognition.

structure of bcl-xl-beclin peptide complex
discussion
in this study, we have shown that beclin 1 is a new member of
the expanding family of bh3-only proteins. beclin 1, originally
identified as a novel bcl-2-interacting protein (27), was the first
functional mammalian autophagy gene identified (23) and
resides at a human tumor susceptibility locus on chromosome
17, which is monoallelically deleted in large numbers of breast,
prostate, and ovarian cancers (24). enforced expression of
beclin 1 in mcf-7 breast carcinoma cells, which show
decreased levels of beclin protein, reduces their tumorigenicity
(23), and heterozygous disruption of beclin 1 in mice leads to
suppression of autophagy and concomitant tumor formation
(25, 26). these results have fueled the notion of autophagy as a
general tumor-suppressive mechanism.
surprisingly little is known about what beclin 1 actually does
in cells. other than its constituency in a complex with the class
iii phosphoinositol 3-kinase vps34p (40, 41) and its aforemen-
tioned interaction with bcl-2/xl, the molecular mechanisms by
which beclin 1 functions remain poorly understood. a lack of
known protein motifs as well as an unclear role in autophagy
has confounded analysis of beclin 1 in mammalian systems.
only two domains have been described in beclin 1 prior to the
bh3 domain, a coiled coil domain (residues 140–268) and a
c-terminal evolutionarily conserved domain (residues 244–
337) (42). the coiled coil domain interacts with two previously
characterized partners, npist (43) and uvrag (44), whereas
the evolutionarily conserved domain is thought to bind vps34p
(42).
our structural and biochemical characterization of beclin 1
shows that its bh3 domain is both necessary and sufficient for
interaction with bcl-xl and that the proteins can form a stable
complex in vitro. we further report the molecular details dic-
tating the interaction of the two proteins. the identification of
the beclin bh3 domain implies that beclin may be able to reg-
ulate bcl-2, at least in some circumstances, rather than or in
addition to the recently reported ability of bcl-2 to regulate
beclin 1 (22). the literature is replete with examples of bh3-
only proteins, which serve as death ligands, engaging down-
stream multidomain bcl-2 proteins prior to release of cyto-
chrome c. thus, there is ample precedent indicating that beclin
1, which has now been shown to contain a bh3 domain, may
function in a similar capacity.
there is a possibility, although unsupported, that the bh3
domain of beclin 1 mediates a novel function with respect to the
bcl-2 family. for example, it could serve as an adaptor for load-
ing mitochondria into autophagosomes, which has been previ-
ously suggested (45–47). additionally, characterization of the
bh3-only e3 ubiquitin ligase arf-bp1/mule has demon-
strated that the bh3 domain, in at least one case, can be used for
substrate recognition (48). it is worth noting, however, that a
canonical death ligand function for its bh3 helix was, as the
authors noted, not explicitly ruled out by the ability of arf-bp1/
mule to polyubiquitinate mcl-1 (48). that is, arf-bp1/mule
may counter mcl-1-mediated inhibition of bak in addition to
recognizing it as a substrate for ubiquitination. nevertheless,
the clear majority (if not all) of bh3-only proteins identified to
date, including arf-bp1/mule, function in a pro-apoptotic

serves as a readout of the strength and/or specificity of bh3
binding. this speculation and other potential implications of
the tyr-101 conformations remain to be experimentally
investigated.
the structure, combined with our biochemical results, vali-
dates the bh3 domain of beclin as both necessary and sufficient
for interaction with anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 fam-
ily. thus, beclin 1 can be definitively classified as a new member
of the bh3-only family of proteins.

manner upstream of bcl-2 and bax-like proteins. given this
precedent, it is not unreasonable to posit that beclin 1 similarly
contains a pro-apoptotic function mediated by its bh3 domain.
an unidentified apoptotic function may partially explain the
ability of beclin to suppress tumors. three of nine previously
described bh3-only proteins, bim (49, 50), bad (51), and
puma (52), have been shown to function as tumor suppressors
in mouse models, and virtually every bh3-only protein has
been found to be dysregulated or mutated in at least one human
cancer (11). similarly, beclin 1 is a bh3-only protein that can
function as a tumor suppressor in mice and is deleted in many
human cancers. thus, beclin fits the pattern of a canonical
bh3-only protein extremely well and therefore is predicted to
display similar activities. the generation of bh3 mutant
knock-in mice should help clarify whether the bh3 domain of
beclin 1 is involved in its tumor suppressor function.
paradoxically, defects in apoptosis were not observed upon
uv irradiation or serum withdrawal of beclin 1-null mouse
embryonic stem cells, suggesting that beclin 1 is not involved in
apoptotic cell death (26). this negative result has been inter-
preted to indicate a novel, non-apoptotic (i.e. autophagic)
tumor suppressor function for beclin 1 (14, 26, 53). however,
we note that one might not expect to see defects in apoptosis
induced by such stimuli unless the particular pathways mediat-
ing their specific effects were additionally disrupted in beclin
1-null mouse embryonic stem cells. that is, the p53 pathway
inducing noxa and puma and the non-apoptotic aif pathway,
known to mediate the effects of uv damage and serum with-
drawal, respectively (26), would need to be damaged in beclin
1-null beclin cells in order for apoptosis to be affected. it is
likely that both of these pathways are intact in beclin 1-null
embryonic stem cells, although no evidence for or against this
hypothesis has been presented to date. beclin 1 might mediate
apoptosis of an uncharacterized death stimulus (for example,
nutrient deprivation), which would be missed if not assayed for
explicitly in such experiments. re-examination of the p53 and
aif pathways in beclin 1-null cells should help resolve this
issue.
further complicating a putative pro-apoptotic role for beclin
1, several recent studies have suggested that autophagy can pro-
tect mitochondria from apoptotic stimuli (54, 55). for example,
overexpression of beclin 1 in cos-7 cells yielded a slight resist-
ance to apoptosis induced by staurosporine, which was elimi-
nated upon treatment of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methylad-
enine (55). this result suggests that the autophagy function of
beclin 1 can be cytoprotective in certain situations. thus,
beclin 1 appears to have the ability to modulate the opposing
survival and death functions of both apoptosis and autophagy.
any model of how beclin 1 works would have to account for all
of these apparently incompatible activities.
although autophagic cell death has yet to be clearly demon-
strated in mammalian cells containing intact apoptotic
machinery, its existence would clearly necessitate a high degree
of coordination between the disparate death pathways. the
molecular mechanisms involved in coordinating the survival
and death functions of autophagy, and each in turn with apo-
ptosis, remain enigmatic. autophagy, even in survival mode, is
likely to be highly coordinated with apoptosis in order for the
structure of bcl-xl-beclin peptide complex
cell to switch from scavenging to dismantling. one possibility is
that, under homeostatic conditions, bcl-2 family proteins
would suppress both apoptosis and autophagy, accomplishing
the latter through direct binding to beclin 1, whereas excessive
cytotoxic stress would trigger classical apoptosis via bh3-only
proteins (including beclin 1 itself) but would default to autoph-
agic cell death upon obstruction of apoptosis, such as through
the lack of atp or at a pathway lesion. such a sequence of
events would be consistent with recent insights suggesting that
the disparate cell death mechanisms exist as a highly interwo-
ven continuum of cellular pathways, which facilitates physio-
logic and pathologic responses to various stimuli (56, 57).
a significant question arising from this work is whether auto-
phagy, in general, is tumor-suppressive or beclin 1 is a “special”
autophagy gene with a secondary function in tumor suppres-
sion. it has been noted that oncogenes (e.g. phosphoinositol
3-kinase, akt, bcl-2) generally inhibit autophagy and that
tumor suppressors (e.g. pten, p53, beclin) generally activate
autophagy (14, 29, 58). nevertheless, a direct correlation
between loss of autophagy and tumorigenesis has yet to be
observed, as homozygous deletion of essential autophagy genes
leads to early post-natal lethality in mice (59, 60). thus, it
remains a possibility that beclin 1 is unique among autophagy
genes and suppresses tumors through a previously unidentified
function, separate from its ability to influence autophagy. such
a function might be provided by the bh3 domain.
in summary, we have shown that beclin 1 is a novel bh3-only
protein, which suggests a novel function upstream of bcl-2/bcl-
xl. further experiments will be required to determine the pre-
cise role of the beclin bh3 domain in physiologic settings.
nonetheless, available observations suggest that beclin 1 may
contain a proapoptotic function, which could be related to its
ability to suppress tumors in mammalian systems. a greater
understanding of this mechanism will hopefully lead to new
insights into the role of autophagy in cancer, as well as other
autophagy-related diseases.
