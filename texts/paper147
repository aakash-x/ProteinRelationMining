mitochondrial dysfunction is a common consequence of
ischemia-reperfusion and drug injuries. for example, sublethal
injury of renal proximal tubular cells (rptcs) with the model
oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (tbhp) causes mitochondrial
injury that recovers over the course of six days. although regen-
eration of mitochondrial function is integral to cell repair and
function, the signaling pathway of mitochondrial biogenesis fol-
lowing oxidant injury has not been examined. a 10-fold overex-
pression of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator ppar-␥
cofactor-1␣ (pgc-1␣) in control rptcs resulted in a 52%
increase in mitochondrial number, a 27% increase in respiratory
capacity, and a 30% increase in mitochondrial protein markers,
demonstrating that pgc-1␣mediates mitochondrial biogenesis
in rptcs. rptcs sublethally injured with tbhp exhibited a
50% decrease in mitochondrial function and increased mito-
chondrial autophagy. compared with the controls, pgc-1␣lev-
elsincreased12-foldondays1,2,and3post-injuryandreturned
to base line on day 4 as mitochondrial function returned. inhi-
bition p38 mapk blocked the up-regulation of pgc-1␣follow-
ing oxidant injury, whereas inhibition of calcium-calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase, calcineurin a, nitric-oxide synthase,
and phosphoinositol 3-kinase had no effect. the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr) was activated following tbhp
exposure, and the egfr inhibitor ag1478 blocked the up-reg-
ulation of pgc-1␣. additional inhibitor studies revealed that
the sequential activation of src, p38 mapk, egfr, and p38
mapk regulate the expression of pgc-1␣ following oxidant
injury.incontrast,althoughaktwasactivatedfollowingoxidant
injury, it did not play a role in pgc-1␣expression. we suggest
that mitochondrial biogenesis following oxidant injury is medi-
ated by p38 and egfr activation of pgc-1␣.

(1). pgc-1␣is highly expressed in tissues with high metabolic
demands, such as heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney (1). ectopic
expression of pgc-1␣was later shown to stimulate the biogen-
esis of mitochondria by increasing the expression of nuclear
respiratory factors 1 and 2 and enhancing the transcriptional
activity of nuclear respiratory factor 1 on the promoter for
mitochondrial transcription factor a (1). in addition to cold
exposure, expression of pgc-1␣is responsive to various phys-
iological stimuli, such as exercise, caloric restriction, and expo-
sure to lipopolysaccharide (1–4), demonstrating the ability of
pgc-1␣to alter the metabolic state of the cell in response to
changes in the cellular or extracellular environment. what has
not been examined is the signaling pathway responsible for
mitochondrial biogenesis following cellular and mitochondrial
injury, particularly oxidative stress.
a variety of signaling mechanisms have been proposed to
regulate the expression of pgc-1␣and mitochondrial biogen-
esis including nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase (5–12),
␤-adrenergic/camp (1), calcineurin a, calcium/calmodulin-de-
pendentproteinkinase(camk)(13,14),andampkinase(15).p38
mapk is also thought to regulate pgc-1␣through phospho-
rylation of thr262, ser265, and thr298 within the repressor
domain of pgc-1␣(1, 16). phosphorylation of these residues
displaces a p160 myb-binding protein, stabilizing the
pgc-1␣ protein and increasing its ability to function as a
coactivator (17).
ischemia-reperfusion injury in the kidney and other organs is
characterized by de-energization of mitochondria resulting in
severe energy deficits within the proximal tubule, which pres-
ent within 60 min of the onset of ischemia (18–20). further, a
large number of nephrotoxic xenobiotics target the mitochon-
dria (21). these changes in renal proximal tubular cell (rptc)
energetics also are observed in cellular models subjected to
diverse stresses (22–26). for example, sublethally injured
rptcs exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, such as decreases in
oxygen consumption and atp levels, following exposure to the
model oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide that spontaneously
recovers over the course of six days (27, 28). the recovery of
mitochondrial function is temporally related to rptc de-dif-
ferentiation, migration, and proliferation, and complete recov-
ery of mitochondrial function is associated with rptc rediffer-
entiation (28, 29). the recovery of mitochondrial function is
central to the overall restoration of cell structure and function.
egfr expression is up-regulated following renal ischemia-
reperfusion injury (30, 31), and the egfr is required for recov-
ery of function following mercuric chloride-induced renal fail-
ure in mice (32). further, the egfr is an important mediator of
rptc dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation following

diverse forms of injury (33, 34). for example, src-dependent
phosphorylation of p38 mpak results in the transactivation of
the egfr following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (33), sug-
gesting that p38 mapk transactivation of the egfr may be
important in the recovery of rptc function following oxidant
injury.
although the regenerative properties of the rptc are
known, the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis following
injury have not been examined nor has a central role of pgc-1␣
been determined in this process. in this study, we have eluci-
dated a mechanism for mitochondrial biogenesis following oxi-
dant injury.
experimental procedures
reagents—ly294002, ag1478, and sb203580 were obtained
from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma), biomol (plym-
outh meeting, pa), and tocris (ellisville, mo), respectively.
fenvalerate and bay 41-2272 were purchased from alexis cor-
poration (san diego, ca). odq was purchased from acros
organics (geel, belgium). all other chemicals were purchased
from sigma. antibodies to phospho-egfr (tyr1068), phospho-
src (tyr416), src, phospho-p38, and p38 were obtained from
cell signaling technology. the antibodies to pgc-1␣, cox
iii, and the egfr were purchased from santa cruz biotechnol-
ogy (santa cruz, ca). anti-pgc-1␣and anti-cox iii was used
at concentrations of 1:500 and 1:300, respectively, whereas all
other antibodies were used at 1:1000.
isolation and culture of renal proximal tubules—female
new zealand white rabbits (2 kg) were purchased from myr-
tle’s rabbitry (thompson station, tn). rptcs were isolated
using the iron oxide perfusion method and grown in 35-mm
tissue culture dishes under improved conditions as previously
described (35). the culture medium was a 1:1 mixture of dul-
becco’s modified eagle’s medium/ham’s f-12 medium (with-
out glucose, phenol red, or sodium pyruvate) supplemented
with 15 mm hepes buffer, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1 ␮m pyridox-
ine hcl, 15 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 6 mm lactate. hydro-
cortisone (50 nm), selenium (5 ng/ml), human transferrin (5
␮g/ml), bovine insulin (10 nm), and l-ascorbic acid-2-phos-
phate (50 ␮m) were added daily to fresh culture medium.
confluent rptcs were used for all experiments. rptc
monolayers were pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 h and
exposed to 200 ␮m tbhp for 45 min, at which point the oxi-
dant-containing media were removed, fresh media were added,
and inhibitors replaced as indicated in the figure legends.
replication-deficient adenovirus
infection—recombinant
adenovirus-expressing pgc-1␣and nuclear gfp control were
generous gifts from bruce spiegelman (harvard medical
school) (36). viral titers were determined by plaque formation
assay using hek293 cells and expressed as plaque-forming
units. rptcs were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of
infection of 30 plaque-forming units for 24 h at 37 °c in a
humidified 5% co2 incubator. afterward, the cultures were
placed in normal culture media for an additional 24 h, at which
point all measurements were taken. at an multiplicity of infec-
tion of 30 plaque-forming units, 99% of the cells showed expres-
sion of the viral gene insert as indicated by flow cytometry (data
not shown).
basal oxygen consumption (qo2)—on days 1–6 after tbhp
injury, rptcs were gently detached from the culture dishes
with a rubber policeman and transferred to a 37 °c qo2 cham-
ber. basal and uncoupled (fccp) rptc qo2 was measured
polarographically by using a clark-type electrode as described
previously (35).
lipid-based transfections—transient transfections of rptcs
were performed using lipofectamine 2000 according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen).
cell number—measurement of monolayer protein content
over time was used to estimate cell number. on days 1–6 after
tbhp injury, rptc monolayers were washed with phosphate-
buffered saline, solubilized in triton buffer (0.05% triton
x-100, 100 mm tris-base, 150 mm nacl, ph 7.5), sonicated for
60 s, and protein concentrations determined by the bicincho-
ninic acid according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(pierce).
confocal microscopy—all microscopy was performed on a
zeiss lsm 510 confocal microscope. cells for imaging were
plated on 35-mm glass bottom 14-mm microwell petri dishes
from matteck corporation (ashland, ma).
preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot analysis—after
treatment, rptcs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline without ca2⫹ and mg2⫹ and harvested in cell lysis buffer
from biovision (mountain view, ca). cells were disrupted by
sonication for 30 s. equal amounts of cellular protein lysates
were separated by sds-page and electrophoretically trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes. after treatment with 5%
skim milk or bovine serum albumin at 4 °c overnight, mem-
branes were incubated with various antibodies for 2 h and then
incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conju-
gated secondary antibody (santa cruz biotechnology) for 1 h.
bound antibodies were visualized after chemiluminescence
detection on an alphaeasefc stand alone imaging system (san
leandro, ca).
statistical analysis—data are presented as means ⫾ s.e. and
were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance as
appropriate. multiple means were compared using student-
newman-keuls test. p ⬍ 0.05 was considered a statistically sig-
nificant difference between mean values. renal proximal
tubules isolated from an individual rabbit represent a single
experiment (n ⫽ 1). experiments were performed with 2–5
plates of cells and repeated until an n value of at least 3 was
reached.
results
exposure of rptc to the adenovirus that produced
pgc-1␣expression resulted in a 10-fold increase in pgc-1␣
protein expression at 48 h (fig. 1a). the green fluorescent pro-
tein expressed on the c terminus of pgc-1␣was localized to
the rptc nuclear compartment, consistent with its role as a
nuclear receptor coactivator (fig. 1b). the mitochondria of
rptc infected with the adenoviral pgc-1␣and nuclear gfp
controls were stained with the potentiometric dye mitotracker
red, and visualization of the mitochondria using confocal
microscopy revealed an increase in red staining in rptcs in the
pgc-1␣-treated group (fig. 1b). quantification of this change
in staining intensity revealed a 51% increase in mitochondrial

drial biogenesis in the renal proximal tubule and a potential
target for regulating cellular bioenergetics in the kidney follow-
ing injury.
control rptcs transfected with a mitochondrially targeted
gfp showed a normal branched morphology and did not asso-
ciate with lysosomes stained with lysotracker red (fig. 4).
rptcs affected by acute tbhp exposure (200 ␮m for 45 min)
underwent significant mitochondrial autophagy 24 h following
injury, as demonstrated by the colocalization of mitochondria
and lysosomes (fig. 4). these results are consistent with the loss
of mitochondrial function triggering the selective autophagy of
mitochondria (37, 38).
although rptcs expressed low levels of pgc-1␣ protein
under basal conditions,
following acute tbhp exposure,
pgc-1␣protein levels increased 12-fold 24 h after injury (fig.
5). levels of pgc-1␣remained elevated for three days following
injury and then returned to control levels four days after the
oxidant insult. basal qo2 increased on day 2 following oxidant
exposure and returned to control levels on day 4 (fig. 5).
uncoupled qo2 increased on day 3 and returned to control
levels on day 4. thus, following oxidant exposure, pgc-1␣pro-
tein levels markedly increased within 24 h, were maintained
while basal and uncoupled qo2 were increasing, and returned

rptcs were pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 h and then exposed to tbhp for 45 min, at which point the medium was changed and the inhibitors
replaced. immunoblots for pgc-1␣were performed 24 h after exposure to tbhp. rptcs were treated with l-name (a), odq (b), bay-41-2272 (c), kn-62 (d),

injury was observed with the addition of the p38 inhibitor
sb203580 (10 ␮m) (fig. 6).
we previously reported (33, 34) that p38 is activated in
rptcs in response to h2o2 and interacts with src, phospha-
tidylinositol 3-kinase, and the egfr. similarly, exposure to
tbhp also results in the phosphorylation of src, p38, and the
egfr (fig. 7). pp1 (10 ␮m) completely abolished the up-regu-
lation of pgc-1␣as did an inhibitor of the egfr (ag1478, 20
␮m) (fig. 7). in contrast, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-ki-
nase with ly202190 (10 ␮m) had no effect on pgc-1␣expres-
sion (fig. 7).
having established that src, p38, and the egfr play a role in
pgc-1␣ expression following oxidant injury, we confirmed
that these kinases are activated following oxidant exposure and
sought to place these signaling molecules into a mitochondrial
biogenesis pathway. both src and p38 were maximally phos-
phorylated within 5 min of tbhp exposure, whereas the egfr
was not maximally phosphorylated until 20 min after exposure
to tbhp (fig. 8).
rptcs were preincubated with pp1, sb203580, or ag1478
and then exposed to tbhp or a vehicle control for 30 min, and
samples were taken for immunoblot analysis. pretreatment
with pp1 prevented the phosphorylation of src, p38 mapk,
and the egfr, suggesting src is upstream of p38 and the egfr
(fig. 8). pretreatment with sb203580 prevented the phospho-
rylation of p38 and the egfr but not src, suggesting that p38 is
downstream of src and is responsible for the transactivation of
the egfr (fig. 8). inhibition of egfr activation with ag1478
prevented the phosphorylation of the egfr but did not prevent
the phosphorylation of either src or p38, suggesting that the
egfr is indeed downstream of src and p38 (fig. 8) immediately
following tbhp exposure.
phosphorylation of both p38 and the egfr is still present 60
min after tbhp exposure (fig. 9). pretreatment of rptcs with
sb203580 prevents the phosphorylation of the egfr at 60 min;
however, when sb203580 is added 30 min after exposure to
tbhp, it no longer inhibits egfr phosphorylation, suggesting
that, although p38 is responsible for the initial transactivation
of the egfr, the sustained phosphorylation of the egfr occurs
through another mechanism (fig. 9). as stated above, pretreat-
ment with ag1478 does not inhibit p38 phosphorylation, plac-
ing p38 upstream of the egfr during initiation of the signaling
cascade (fig. 9). interestingly, when ag1478 is added after 30
min of tbhp exposure, p38 phosphorylation is abolished, sug-
gesting that the egfr mediates the late stage phosphorylation
of p38 mapk (fig. 9).

discussion
figure 8. pgc-1␣is up-regulated following tbhp-induced injury through
the sequential activation of src, p38 mapk, and the egfr. a, time course of
src (tyr416), p38 mapk (thr180, tyr182), and egfr (tyr1068) phosphorylation was
performed in the presence of 200 ␮m tbhp. b, phosphorylation of src, p38 mapk,
and the egfr in the presence and absence of their respective inhibitors of pp1,
sb203580 (sb), and ag1478 (ag) was determined by immunoblot analysis follow-
ing tbhp exposure. rptcs were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min, and sam-
ples were taken after 30 min of tbhp exposure. blots are representative of at least
three separate experiments.
pgc-1␣ is generally thought to be the master regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis in adipose tissue, heart, and liver (39).
we have demonstrated that pgc-1␣has the ability to induce
mitochondrial biogenesis in control rptcs, suggesting that
pgc-1␣also plays a central role in regulating the biogenesis in
rptcs. pgc-1␣is known to up-regulate gluconeogenesis (36,
40), a process that may require increasing concentrations of
atp and thus also explain the increase in the basal respiration
that is observed with the ectopic expression of pgc-1␣.
although mitochondrial biogenesis has been studied in
response to different stimuli in a few tissues (1–4), the mecha-
nisms of mitochondrial biogenesis following cell injury and
regeneration has not been examined. we previously demon-
strated that oxidant exposure (i.e. tbhp) decreases mitochon-
drial function and that mitochondrial function returns over a
period of days to control levels (27, 28). in this paper, we have
shown that the loss of mitochondrial function is associated
mitochondrial damage and autophagy.
one day following oxidant injury, basal respiration increased,
whereas uncoupled respiration did not. this response is consist-
ent with the idea that the cells utilize the residual capacity of the
mitochondria to survive and initiate repair. on day two follow-
ing injury, both basal and uncoupled respiration increased and
returned to control values on day 4. because ectopic expression
of pgc-1␣ in rptcs resulted in robust biogenesis of mito-
chondria, we hypothesized that up-regulation of endogenous
pgc-1␣ was responsible for the restoration of mitochondrial

blot samples were collected 30 min later. blots are representative of at least

function by regulating the production of new mitochondria.
the up-regulation of pgc-1␣on days 1–3 post-injury is con-
sistent with the initiation of the recovery of mitochondrial
function, whereas the decrease in pgc-1␣on day four is con-
sistent with a negative feedback mechanism preventing the for-
mation of additional mitochondria as mitochondrial function is
restored.
of the various signaling mechanisms that have been impli-
cated in the regulation of pgc-1␣expression, including nitric
oxide (5–12), ␤-adrenergic receptors, camk, and amp kinase

(1, 13–15), only p38 mapk appears to be important in the
regulation of pgc-1␣ expression following oxidant injury in
our model. our results are consistent with reports that phos-
phorylation of p38 mapk increases pgc-1␣expression by sta-
bilizing existing protein (1, 16) or promoting the transcription
of pgc-1␣ through an activating transcription factor-2-
dependent mechanism (41). interestingly, following oxidant
injury, p38 mapk appears to play two roles in mitochondrial
biogenesis upstream and downstream of the egfr (see below).
following injury, p38 mapk is phosphorylated by src and
then transactivates the egfr. this signaling pathway appears
to be a common response of rptcs to oxidant injury, as the
same signaling cascade was observed following acute exposure
of rptcs to h2o2 (33). however, the mechanism of egfr
transactivation by p38 mapk has yet to be determined. our
experiments also provide evidence that p38 mapk is an egfr
substrate in this model system. the addition of the egfr inhib-
itor ag1478 30 min post-oxidant addition blocked the phos-
phorylation of p38 mapk and decreased pgc-1a expression.
the role of the egfr in mitochondrial biogenesis may, in part,
be sustaining the actions of p38 mapk on pgc-1␣expression
and stability. interestingly, activation of the egfr through the
addition of exogenous egf (10 ng/ml for 24 h) strongly acti-
vated the egfr but did not increase the expression of pgc-1␣
(data not shown), suggesting that egfr-dependent pgc-1␣
expression is dependent upon the transactivation of the egfr.
this is the first report that the egfr is a mediator of mito-
chondrial biogenesis. we previously demonstrated that oxi-
dant-induced injury results in the dedifferentiation, migration,
and proliferation through the egfr (33, 34). egfr initiation of
mitochondrial biogenesis, in concert with dedifferentiation,
migration, and proliferation, may represent an integrated path-
way to ensure sufficient energy for repair, regeneration, and
ultimately, the return of normal differentiation function.
the egfr is capable of activating a series of signaling path-
ways that may be involved in regulating pgc-1␣ expression,
including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (34, 42). however,
inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt had no effect
on the expression of pgc-1␣following oxidant exposure. yet,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt is activated following oxi-
dant injury in this model and is required for cellular prolifera-
tion (34). thus, the pathways may diverge at this point. how-
ever, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt may contribute to the
biogenesis of mitochondria downstream of pgc-1␣by directly
phosphorylating nuclear respiratory factor 1 and inducing
mitochondrial transcription factor-a (2). this pathway may
also be involved in regulating the shift from glycogen storage to
glucose utilization through the akt-dependent phosphoryla-
tion and inactivation of glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (43).
we cannot disregard a possible role for the activation of
amp kinase in regulating pgc-1␣in our model. amp kinase is
activated in response to cell stressors causing perturbations in
camp/atp ratios (44), can participate in the activation of the
p38mapk-signaling cascade (4, 45), and has been implicated in
regulating the expression of pgc-1␣in muscle in response to a
variety of stimuli (36, 46–49). because rapid decreases in cel-
lular atp are observed in tbhp-treated rptcs (28) and amp
kinase is known to be activated under conditions of renal ische-
mitochondrial biogenesis signaling
mia (50), it is possible that amp kinase is activated following
oxidant treatment in our model and will be the subject of future
experiments.
in summary, pgc-1␣-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis
following oxidant injury may promote the repair and recovery
of rptcs and is regulated by a unique signaling pathway
involving the activation of src, p38 mapk, and the egfr. elu-
cidating the mechanisms behind the recovery of mitochondrial
function after injury may provide a promising target to acceler-
ate recovery of cellular functions and may have important
implications in the treatment of acute renal failure and other
epithelial injuries.
acknowledgment—we acknowledge dr. bruce speigelman for his
generous contribution of the pgc-1␣and gfp adenoviral constructs.
