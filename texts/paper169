in arabidopsis root tips cultured in medium containing
sufficient nutrients and the membrane-permeable protease
inhibitor e-64d, parts of the cytoplasm accumulated in the
vacuoles of the cells from the meristematic zone to the
elongation zone. also in barley root tips treated with e-64,
parts of the cytoplasm accumulated in autolysosomes and pre-
existing central vacuoles. these results suggest that vacuolar
and/or lysosomal autophagy occurs constitutively in these
regions of cells. 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy,
inhibited the accumulation of such inclusions in arabidopsis
root tip cells. such inclusions were also not observed in root
tips prepared from arabidopsis t-dna mutants in which
atatg2 or atatg5, an arabidopsis homolog of yeast atg
genes essential for autophagy, is disrupted. in contrast, an
atatg9 mutant,
in which another homolog of atg is
disrupted, accumulated a significant number of vacuolar
inclusions in the presence of e-64d. these results suggest that
both atatg2 and atatg5 proteins are essential for autophagy
whereas atatg9 protein contributes to, but is not essential for,
autophagy in arabidopsis root tip cells. autophagy that is
sensitive to 3-methyladenine and dependent on atg proteins
constitutively occurs in the root tip cells of arabidopsis.

introduction
autophagy is a process in which components of cells,
including cytosol and cell organelles, are degraded in the
lytic organelles, lysosomes and/or vacuoles. cellular com-
ponents are enclosed by membrane sacs to make double
membrane-bounded organelles
called autophagosomes,
and transported into lysosomes/vacuoles, where they are
(dunn
degraded
1994, klionsky
eventually
2004).
autophagy is known to occur under nutrient-deficient
conditions not only in mammalian and yeast cells but also
in plant cells (chen et al. 1994, aubert et al. 1996, moriyasu
and ohsumi 1996), and thus is supposed to contribute to
intracellular nutrient supply when nutrient uptake from the
environment is limiting. in plant cells,
it has also been
observed in various developmental processes (moriyasu and
hillmer 2000); membranes derived from endoplasmic
reticulum (er) or the trans-golgi network have been
observed to enclose a part of the cytoplasm and become a
vacuole through autophagy in root tip cells, suggesting that
autophagy is involved in vacuole genesis (marty 1978,
amelunxen and heinze 1984, hilling and amelunxen 1985,
marty 1999). recently, it has been shown that autophagy is
also involved in the regulation of the programmed cell death
that occurs in pathogen-infected plant cells (liu et al. 2005,
seay and dinesh-kumar 2005).
protease inhibitors are useful
tools for analyzing
autophagy. the treatment of mammalian cells undergoing
autophagy with cysteine protease inhibitors
such as
leupeptin causes the accumulation of lysosomes containing
cytoplasmic components, the autolysosomes (kominami
et al. 1983). similarly, treatment of yeast cells with the
serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride
results in the accumulation of membrane-bounded parts
of the cytoplasm, the autophagic bodies, in the vacuole
(takeshige et al. 1992). in cultured tobacco cells, auto-
phagy, which accompanies the net degradation of cellular
proteins, is induced by transfer to culture medium lacking
sucrose (moriyasu and ohsumi 1996). the addition of a
cysteine protease inhibitor such as e-64c,
leupeptin or
antipain to the culture medium inhibits net protein
degradation, and particles of cytoplasm accumulate in
membrane-bounded structures. they were designated as
plant autolysosomes by analogy with mammalian cells
(moriyasu and ohsumi 1996). in the absence of inhibitors,
the particles of cytoplasm segregated in autolysosomes are
thought to be degraded by the action of proteases there. of
various cysteine protease inhibitors, e-64d is a more

autophagy in arabidopsis root tip cells
membrane-permeable analog of e-64 (tamai et al. 1986,
moriyasu 1995). after treatment with e-64d, autolysosomes
similar to those in cultured tobacco cells accumulated in
root cells prepared from barley seedlings (moriyasu et al.
2003). these results strongly suggest that also in plant cells,
the application of a cysteine protease inhibitor causes the
accumulation of
formed by
autophagy.
intermediate
structures
3-methyladenine (3-ma) was found to be a potent
inhibitor in mammalian autophagy by screening of various
kinds of chemicals (gordon and seglen 1982, seglen and
gordon 1982). it has been thought to block the formation
of autophagosomes. recently, 3-ma has been shown to
block autophagy almost completely in tobacco cells
cultured under nutrient-deficient conditions (takatsuka
et al. 2004, inoue and moriyasu 2006).
molecular genetic analysis of autophagy in yeast cells
cultured under starvation conditions revealed more than a
dozen genes essential for autophagy (tsukada and ohsumi
1993, thumm et al. 1994, for a review, see also klionsky
and ohsumi 1999). these genes were designated as atg
genes (klionsky et al. 2003). the arabidopsis genome has 25
atg genes that are homologous to 12 of the yeast atg
genes (hanaoka et al. 2002), and t-dna mutant plants in
which atg4, atg5, atg7 and atg9 were disrupted have
been isolated and characterized (doelling et al. 2002,
hanaoka et al. 2002, yoshimoto et al. 2004, thompson
et al. 2005). these mutants entered senescence slightly
earlier

deficient conditions, which include earlier degradation of

than wild-type plants. moreover,
in yeast cells, a product of the atg8 gene is known to
be localized to autophagosomes and thus can be used as a
marker of autophagosomes formation (kirisako et al.
1999). the fusion protein of atg8 and green fluorescent
protein (gfp) expressed in arabidopsis cells was localized
on punctate structures, which were presumed to be
autophagosomes by analogy with yeast cells (yoshimoto
et al. 2004, sla´ vikova´ et al. 2005, thompson et al. 2005).

et al. 2005). in contrast, such accumulation did not occur in
the arabidopsis atg mutants (yoshimoto et al. 2004,
thompson et al. 2005). these results were interpreted as
showing that autophagy does not occur in the atg mutants.
in two of these studies, autophagy was examined mainly
under starvation conditions or in the dark where photo-
synthetic energy supply is limited (yoshimoto et al. 2004,
thompson et al. 2005), whereas in the other study, it has

conditions
(sla´ vikova´ et al. 2005). in the present study, using e-64d,
a reliable autophagy inhibitor other than concanamycin, we
examined autophagy in the cells of root tips excised from
arabidopsis and barley seedlings. we found that in root
cells, autophagy occurs constitutively, although it is further
activated under nutrient-limiting conditions. we examined
the effect of 3-ma on this autophagy and whether it occurs
in the arabidopsis atg mutant plants in which an atg2,
atg5 or atg9 gene is disrupted.
results
morphology of root tips immediately after excision
we first stained root tips immediately after excision
from arabidopsis seedlings with neutral red, which stains
the acidic compartments of cells (fig. 1a). as expected, the
central vacuoles were stained in the cells of root tips
(fig. 1a, arrows). in addition to the central vacuoles,
spherical structures of 0.5–3 mm in diameter were stained
red in a region from the tips of the roots to approximately
200 mm away from the tips (fig. 1a, arrowheads). almost
all of these spherical structures were found in the cytoplasm,
but some were moving in a brownian manner and thus were
thought to exist in the central vacuoles. with the exception
of these structures, almost all vacuoles of the cells in this
region appeared to be empty. in this study, we did not
analyze these structures in detail. however, when root tips
were stained with toluidine blue, similar spherical structures
were stained blue (fig. 1b, arrowheads). since toluidine
blue mainly stains protein and/or rna, some of these
spherical structures could be granules of storage proteins
located in protein storage vacuoles. in addition,
large
central vacuoles in more mature cells above this region also
appeared empty (image not shown).
parts of the cytoplasm accumulate in autolysosomes and/or
pre-existing vacuoles of root cells after treatment with e-64d
marked morphological changes did not occur in cells
of root tips incubated in culture medium for 1 d (fig. 1c,
e). however, particulate structures were found to accumu-
late in the vacuoles of root tip cells 3 h after the addition of
e-64d to the culture medium (fig. 1g, 3 h; arrows). the
number of these structures gradually increased for several
hours (fig. 1g, 6 and 9 h; arrows), and the accumulation of
many particulate structures was clearly seen after 1 d
(fig. 1d, f; arrows). these structures were stained more
intensely with neutral red than the lumen of the central
vacuole, probably because of the stronger absorption of the
dye. such particulate structures were observed in all 20 root
tips examined in four independent experiments.

to analyze these particulate structures further, we

microscopy (fig. 2). in both the relatively young and mature
cells of
treated with e-64d for 1 d, many

tips
degradation products of
cytoplasmic organelles were
observed in the vacuoles (fig. 2a, c; arrows). in contrast,
the vacuole appeared to be almost empty in the cells of root
tips treated only with 1% (w/v) methanol used as a solvent
control (fig. 2b, d). these results suggest that cytoplasmic
particles accumulate in autolysosomes that are newly formed
or in large pre-existing vacuoles by the treatment with e-64d.
in a previous study, we reported that when immature
root tip cells of barley, which lack large vacuoles, are treated
with e-64d, parts of the cytoplasm mainly accumulate in
newly synthesized autolysosomes (moriyasu et al. 2003). to
examine the consistency of the results from arabidopsis root
tips with those from barley root tips, we observed relatively
mature cells of barley root tips treated with the inhibitor
(fig. 3). in these cells, parts of the cytoplasm accumulated
not only in small vacuoles but also in pre-existing large
vacuoles (fig. 3, arrows); these small vacuoles appeared to be
newly formed autolysosomes, and the large vacuoles
appeared to be pre-existing central vacuoles. even after 1 d,
we occasionally observed small autolysosomes outside of the
central vacuole (data not shown). these results suggest that
autolysosomes formed in the cytoplasm fuse with the central
vacuole and, as a result, particles in autolysosomes are
transferred into the central vacuole.
autophagy in root tip cells is inhibited by 3-ma
to investigate whether or not 3-ma inhibits autophagy
in the root tip cells, we cultured arabidopsis root tips in the
presence of e-64d and/or 3-ma for 1 d (fig. 4). after
incubation, root tips were stained with neutral red and
observed by light microscopy (fig. 4a–c). this result was
consistent with our previous observations; empty vacuoles
were mostly observed in control root tips, which were treated
with 1% (v/v) methanol as a solvent control of e-64d
addition and 5% (v/v) water as a solvent control of 3-ma
addition, whereas particulate structures accumulated in
central vacuoles in root tips that were cultured in the
presence of e-64d and water (fig. 4b vs. a). in contrast, in
root tip cells cultured in the presence of both e-64d and
3-ma,
the number of particulate structures decreased
(fig. 4c vs. b). thirteen out of 17 root tips showed a clear
decrease (a representative image is presented in fig. 4c), and
the other four root tips showed a slight decrease.
3-ma blocks autophagy in tobacco cells cultured
under sucrose starvation conditions almost completely
(takatsuka et al. 2004). in contrast, the inhibition of
autophagy by 3-ma did not appear to be complete in the
tips cells of arabidopsis, and we detected some
root
accumulation of inclusion bodies in the vacuole even in
the presence of 3-ma (fig. 4, compare a and c). thus it is
possible that a sufficient concentration of 3-ma is unable to
diffuse into intact root tips, and thus the concentration of
3-ma in root tip cells could be suboptimal.

isolation of atg2, atg5 and atg9 mutant plants
atg genes are essential for autophagy to occur in yeast
cells under nutrient starvation conditions (klionsky and
ohsumi 1999). to examine whether arabidopsis genes
homologous to these yeast atg genes (atatgs) are
involved in autophagy in root tip cells, we used mutant
plants in which atatg genes were disrupted. we chose
atatg2 (at3g19190), atatg5 (at5g17290) and atatg9
(at2g31260) because the blastp search for the homologs
of yeast atg2, atg5 and atg9 genes revealed only one
homolog of each gene in the arabidopsis genome. the
amino acid sequences of atatg5 and atatg9 proteins have
already been aligned with their counterparts from other
organisms (thompson et al. 2005, hanaoka et al. 2002,
respectively). here we present the alignment of atatg2 with
its homologs from other organisms (supplementary fig. 1).

its counterparts of yeast

arabidopsis
dye
(fig. 4d–l) and confirmed by this staining that parts of
the cytoplasm accumulate in vacuoles or lysosomes in the
presence of e-64d (fig. 4, compare d and e, or j and k).
treatment with 3-ma decreased the quantity of these
inclusions (fig. 4; compare e and f, or k and l). we
interpret these data as demonstrating that 3-ma blocks
a step upstream from the step of proteolysis that is sensitive
to e-64d and, as a result, autophagic inclusions did not
accumulate even in the presence of e-64d.
putting the results obtained thus far in this study and
the results from a previous study (moriyasu et al. 2003)
together, we conclude that autophagy occurs in root tip
cells of barley and arabidopsis and that we can observe
autophagy by light microscopy after treatment with e-64d.

(see materials and methods) and the primers 7 and 8 (7þ 8). the products of pcr were separated on agarose gels and stained with
ethidium bromide.
this result suggests that the transport of parts of the
cytoplasm to vacuoles by autophagy is enhanced in sucrose-
free culture medium. in contrast, no further accumulation
of cytoplasmic particles was found in root tips of atatg2-1,
atatg5-3 or atatg5-1 mutants treated in the same way
(fig. 7, compare þsuc and  suc in atg2 and atg5), showing
the enhanced portion of autophagic transport of
that
cytoplasmic components into vacuoles is also dependent
on atg2 and atg5 gene products.
quantification of autophagy in the root cells of arabidopsis
by analyzing images of root tips, we tried to quantify
the accumulation of cytoplasmic materials due to the
inhibition of autophagy by e-64d, and defined the
autophagic score as described in materials and methods
(fig. 8). the score reflected our interpretation of the
photographs well with respect to the accumulation of
cytoplasmic materials in vacuoles. it was 55 in root tips
used in this study (fig. 8; 0 h, filled bar), and did not alter
during 24 h of incubation of root tips in culture medium
(meoh, filled bar). however, it increased up to approxi-
mately 16 after 24 h of incubation with e-64d (wt, filled
bar), showing that the score can reasonably estimate the
accumulation of cytoplasmic materials due to the inhibition
of protein degradation. in contrast, increases of the score
were not observed in atatg2 mutants (atatg2-1, atatg2-1a
and atatg2-1b; filled bar), or atatg5 mutants (atatg5-3 and
atatg5-1, filled bar), which is consistent with our observa-
tion that only a very small amount of cytoplasmic particles
accumulated in the vacuoles of

atatg9 protein is not essential for autophagy in arabidopsis
root cells. in contrast, the autophagic score remained 57
under sucrose starvation conditions in atatg2 and atatg5
mutants (atatg2-1 and atatg5-3, open bar). the score
seemed to be saturated around 20, and the activation of
autophagy in wild-type plants under sucrose starvation
conditions was not reflected enough in the score (fig. 8,
wt, open bar vs. filled bar).
discussion
treatment of barley and arabidopsis root tips with
e-64d led to the accumulation of undegraded cytoplasmic
components in newly formed autolysosomes and/or in the
pre-existing central vacuole of root tip cells (moriyasu et al.
2003, figs. 1–3 in this study). in contrast,
in cultured
tobacco cells treated with e-64c, parts of the cytoplasm
accumulate in autolysosomes and little accumulation is
observed in the central vacuoles (moriyasu and ohsumi
1996). it remains unclear why the sites of accumulation of
cytoplasmic components are different in these cell types.
however, arabidopsis cells cultured in the absence of
sucrose in the presence of e-64c accumulate parts of the
cytoplasm in the central vacuole and the accumulation of
autolysosomes is not observed (y. murayama, h. kubo

in contrast to such a complex situation in plant cells,
where the two organelles, the central vacuoles and auto-
lysosomes, are used as lytic compartments for autophagy,
only one organelle appears to work as a lytic compartment
in mammalian and yeast cells. parts of the cytoplasm
accumulate in autolysosomes in mammalian cells that are
subjected to nutrient starvation in the presence of a cysteine
protease inhibitor (kominami et al. 1983), whereas they
accumulate in the vacuole of yeast cells under starvation
conditions in the presence of a serine protease inhibitor
(takeshige et al. 1992). in the present study, we examined
the cells for the presence or absence of autophagy using a
light microscope without differentiating autolysosomes

fig. 8 image analysis on the accumulation of cytoplasmic
materials in the vacuoles of arabidopsis root cells. root tips from
the wild-type seedlings of the columbia ecotype (wt) and atatg2,
atatg5 and atatg9 mutant seedlings of arabidopsis were incubated
in culture medium containing (filled bar) or lacking (open bar)
sucrose in the presence of e-64d for 1 d. they were stained with
neutral red and photographed. as control experiments, root tips of
the wild type were stained with neutral red immediately after
excision (0 h,
filled bar), or after incubation for 1 d in culture
medium containing sucrose in the absence of e-64d (meoh, filled
bar). autophagic scores were obtained as described in materials
and methods. numbers in the bars show the numbers of root tips
examined in each treatment.
from central vacuoles. how the contribution of these two
organelles to autophagy is regulated will be a future issue in
autophagy of plant cells.
in the atatg2 and atatg5 mutants, cytoplasmic compo-
nents were accumulated only slightly even in the presence of
e-64d (fig. 6). this suggests that atatg2 and atatg5
gene products are essential for autophagy in root tip cells as
in yeast cells. in yeast cells, atg5 protein binds to other atg
proteins, atg12 and atg16, and makes a large protein
complex. this complex is localized to the possible pre-
cursory structure of an autophagosome
called the
pre-autophagosomal structure (pas) (suzuki et al. 2001),
which is thought to work at the initiation step of an
autophagosome formation. atg2 is a peripheral membrane-
associated protein, which is also localized to the pas.
although whether plant cells possess a pas is not yet
known,
it is reasonable to speculate that a pas or a
structure like a pas is also formed in autophagy of plant
root cells and that atatg2 and atatg5 proteins play
essential roles in the pas in the process of autophagy.
the atatg9 mutant
showed less accumulation of
cytoplasmic components in the presence of e-64d than the
wild-type plant, but more than the atatg2 and atatg5
mutants. thus, atatg9 protein may not contribute to
autophagy in arabidopsis root tip cells as much as the
atatg2 and atatg5 proteins. yeast atg9 protein is an
integral membrane protein with several membrane-
spanning regions (noda et al. 2000). it is localized to
various structures existing in the peripheral region of the
vacuole,
including the pas and mitochondria (reggiori
et al. 2004, reggiori et al. 2005). although the significance
of its localization to these structures is unclear, atg9 is
essential for the formation of autophagosomes, i.e. autop-
hagy does not occur in yeast mutants lacking the atg9
gene. taken together, although root tip cells in arabidopsis
seem to use machinery for autophagy similar to that used in
yeast cells, it is likely that the essentiality of some part in the
machinery has been diverted.
even in the atatg2 and atatg5 mutants, a very small
amount of cytoplasmic components was recognized after
incubation with e-64d (fig. 6). this suggests the presence of
the transport of cytoplasmic components into vacuoles that
are independent of atg genes. recently, an er-resident
membrane protein was
reported to be constitutively
transported to vacuoles by a mechanism different from
autophagy, and degraded there (tamura et al. 2004). such
transport may contribute to this significant accumulation of
cytoplasmic materials
of e-64d.
alternatively, the presence of atg-independent autophagic
pathways may contribute to such an accumulation.
presence
the
in
autophagy in arabidopsis root cells appears to be
enhanced under starvation conditions (fig. 7 in this study,
yoshimoto et al. 2004). this suggests that as in other
organisms, autophagy in root cells contributes to provide
substrates for respiration and molecules for the synthesis of
new cellular components under
starvation conditions.
however, autophagy was found to occur even under
nutrient-sufficient conditions in root cells, whereas it does
not appear to occur under nutrient-sufficient conditions in
tobacco suspension-cultured cells (inoue and moriyasu
2006). since the genesis and enlargement of vacuoles occur
the result showing the
constitutively in root
constitutive occurrence of autophagy in root
tip cells
supports the notion that autophagy plays a role in these
events in euphorbia and linus root tip cells (amelunxen and
heinze 1984, marty 1978; for a review, see also marty 1999,
moriyasu and hillmer 2000). taken together, it is likely
that plant root cells use autophagy for providing mem-
branes for the enlargement of the central vacuole.
tip cells,
if autophagy contributes to the formation of vacuoles
in root tip cells, some defects will be expected in vacuolar
morphology in atg mutant plants. however, there were no
obvious defects found in the morphology of the central
vacuoles in the atatg7 and atatg9 mutants grown under

autophagy in arabidopsis root tip cells
hanaoka et al. 2002), whereas the central vacuole seemed
smaller (yoshimoto et al. 2004) and the growth of roots is
slower (doelling et al. 2002, yoshimoto et al. 2004) in the
atatg4 and atatg7 mutants grown under nutrient-deprived
conditions. such phenotypes of the mutants were explained
by the notion that autophagy contributes to the supply of
nitrogen and carbon for continued growth when nutrient
uptake is limiting (doelling et al. 2002). however, we
suppose that the slower growth of the root may also be
caused by slower cell growth, which in turn originates from
the defect of vacuole genesis and enlargement. a more
detailed examination may clarify some defect
in the
vacuolar morphology of the mutant even under nutrient-
sufficient conditions. to test this possibility, we are now
closely examining the vacuolar morphology in root tip cells
of atatg2 and atatg5 mutants.
materials and methods
preparation and incubation of root tips
arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype columbia or landsberg) was
used. the seeds were sterilized for about 5 min with 5% (v/v)
commercially available bleach. the seeds were rinsed with sterile
water, and then sown on dishes containing 0.3% (w/v) gelrite
containing half-strength murashige and skoog (ms) salt mixture
and 3% (w/v) sucrose. the dishes were kept at 48c for 2–3 d, and
then at 22 28c for 6–10 d under continuous light from fluorescent
lamps. root tips (4–6 in number, 8–12 mm in length) excised from
the seedlings were incubated in 2 ml of liquid culture medium
consisting of half-strength ms salt mixture and 3% (w/v) sucrose
at 22 28c in the dark under agitation at 100 r.p.m. in sucrose-free
culture medium, sucrose was replaced with mannitol to keep the
osmotic value constant.
barley (cv. doriru) seedlings were prepared as described
previously (moriyasu et al. 2003). root tips (about 10 mm long)
were incubated in medium consisting of 1 ms salt mixture and
3% (w/v) sucrose, at 25 28c with rotation of 100 r.p.m. as
described previously (moriyasu et al. 2003).
neutral red and lysotracker red staining of arabidopsis root tips
whole root tips were stained with 0.01% (w/v) neutral red in
50 mm mes-tris (ph 6.5) for about 2 min and their bright field
images were observed under a light microscope (optiphoto,
nikon). negative color film (fujicolor, iso400, fuji) photographs
were taken using a photomicrographic camera (microflex ufx-ii,
through 40 or 20 objective lenses and 2.5 or
nikon)
5 projection lenses. alternatively, whole root tips were stained
with 1 mm lysotracker red (molecular probes) as described
(moriyasu et al. 2003), and their fluorescence and nomarski
images were observed using a confocal microscope (lsm510,
zeiss).
sectioning of root tips
root tips of arabidopsis were fixed with 2% (w/v) glutar-
aldehyde and 1% (w/v)
formaldehyde in 100 mm sodium
cacodylate-hcl buffer (ph 6.9) at room temperature for 1 h, and
then at 48c overnight, and post-fixed with 1% (w/v) osmium
tetroxide for 2 h at room temperature. they were then dehydrated
using a series of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in
resin. at
the 50% ethanol
spurr’s
stage of dehydration,
they were en bloc stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 50%
ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. for light microscopy, sections
of 1 mm thickness were made from the blocks of spurr’s resin, and
stained with toluidine blue; for electron microscopy (h-7000,
hitachi, japan), thin sections of 60–80 nm were made and stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
root tips from barley were fixed with 2.5% (w/v) glutar-
aldehyde in millonig’s phosphate buffer consisting of 100 mm
pi-na (ph 7.4) and 86 mm nacl, and post-fixed with 1% (w/v)
osmium tetroxide. they were embedded in spurr’s resin in the
same way as arabidopsis root tips, but the sections were stained
with a mixture (2 : 1) of 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate and 1% (w/v)
kmno4 (moriyasu et al. 2003).

autophagy in arabidopsis root tip cells
1651
quantification of autophagy in the root tip cells of arabidospsis
color photographs of parts of roots, 800–1,200 mm distant
from the tips, were digitalized using a scanner (gt-9300uf,
epson, tokyo, japan). from each image, a rectangular region
(150 mm in length 50 mm in width) was cropped and converted to
a 8-bit grayscale image using the computer software photoshop
(version 7.0, adobe). the resultant image was then converted to
binary using photoshop by defining a grayscale cut-off point,
which was set as the lowest grayscale value of the cytoplasm in the
rectangle. in this conversion, grayscale values below the cut-off
became pure black and those above became pure white. the ratio
of the number of pure black pixels to all the number of pixels in
the rectangle was calculated using the software image j (ver-
sion 3.11, nih, bethesda, md, usa), and defined as the
autophagic score.
