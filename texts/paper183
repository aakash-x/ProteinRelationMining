summary
mammalian innate immunity stimulates antigen-
speciﬁc immune responses and acts to control infec-
tion prior to the onset of adaptive immunity. some
bacterial pathogens replicate within the host cell and
are therefore sheltered from some protective aspects
of innate immunity such as complement. here we
focus on mechanisms of innate intracellular resis-
tance encountered by bacterial pathogens and how
some bacteria can evade destruction by the innate
immune system. major strategies of intracellular anti-
bacterial defence include pathogen compartmental-
ization and iron limitation. compartmentalization of
pathogens within the host endocytic pathway is
critical for generating high local concentrations of
antimicrobial molecules, such as reactive oxygen
species, and regulating concentrations of divalent
cations that are essential for microbial growth. cyto-
solic sensing, autophagy, sequestration of essential
nutrients and membrane attack by antimicrobial pep-
tides are also discussed.
introduction
the mammalian innate immune system serves as a pow-
erful barrier to invading bacterial pathogens by employing
direct antimicrobial mechanisms, and indirectly, by stimu-
lating the potent and antigen-speciﬁc adaptive immune
response. as the peak of primary adaptive immunity, char-
acterized by lymphocyte activation and proliferation, does
not occur until 5–7 days post infection, the innate immune
system must employ resistance mechanisms that control
bacterial survival and replication. successful pathogens,
such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, by deﬁnition are
able to cause disease in spite of innate immune defences.
however, the innate immune system is likely protective

against many opportunistic pathogens and may increase
the infectious dose of a successful pathogen required for
symptomatic disease to occur. the study of host–
pathogen interactions has been instrumental in deﬁning
pathways of
innate immune defence. this review will
focus on innate antimicrobial mechanisms encountered
by bacteria that enter the intracellular niche (table 1).
most
intracellular bacterial pathogens target macroph-
ages or epithelial cells for entry, therefore we will primarily
discuss innate immune strategies within these cell types.
bacteria may enter mammalian cells by phagocytosis or
by facilitating their own uptake, termed invasion. during
the process of phagocytosis or invasion, innate immune
sensors like the toll-like receptors (tlrs) or nod-like
receptors (nlrs) may be triggered by bacterial ligands.
the signalling pathways activated by tlrs and nlrs
have been extensively reviewed elsewhere and predomi-
nantly lead to expression and activation of proinﬂamma-
tory cytokines such as il-1b (inohara et al., 2005; beutler
et al., 2006). these receptor networks perform a critical
but largely paracrine role in innate resistance to intracel-
lular bacteria by allowing infected cells to communicate
with other effectors of
innate and adaptive immunity.
however, some proteins of the tlr and nlr families, as
well as other mechanisms discussed later, play important
and direct roles within infected cells to mediate resistance
to intracellular bacteria.
once inside the host cell, bacteria face a formidable
battery of defences in the endosome or the phagosome, a
specialized vesicle of the endocytic compartment. patho-
genic bacteria have evolved ways to avoid these innate
defences either by diverting normal vesicular trafficking or
by escaping into the host cytosol (fig. 1). although less
well understood, a number of recent studies have dem-
onstrated that innate antibacterial mechanisms also exist
in the mammalian cytosol. however,
the predominant
strategy in innate immunity to intracellular bacterial patho-
gens appears to involve compartmentalization within
membrane bound vacuoles (fig. 2). compartmentaliza-
tion serves multiple purposes in the innate immune
response. first,
the bacteria-
containing vacuole provides an enclosed space within
which the host cell can direct a potent antimicrobial attack
such as the oxidative burst. host enzymes that mediate
antibacterial activity might also compromise essential
the physical barrier of
innate immunity to intracellular infection 1721
host cell functions if their activity were not conﬁned to the
phagosome. second, the bacteria are contained within an
environment that has low nutrient availability compared
with the host cytosol. lastly, while not the focus of this
review, containment of bacteria within the endocytic
pathway facilitates mhc class ii antigen presentation by
professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic
cells, which stimulate antigen speciﬁc adaptive immunity.
fusion with lysosomes
bacterial invasion results in compartmentalization within
an endosome. in a highly regulated manner, endosomes
fuse with late endosomes and lysosomes which have an
acidiﬁed lumen based on the proton pump activity of the
vacuolar atpase (vatpase) (mellman et al., 1986; luzio
et al., 2003). inhibition of vatpase activity by the mac-
rolide, baﬁlomycin a, decreases the antimicrobial activity
of alveolar macrophages (bidani et al., 2000). almost all
intracellular pathogens inhibit or delay lysosome fusion
suggesting that this cellular process must be subverted for
bacteria to successfully establish a replicative environment
(table 1). salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium (salmo-
nella typhimurium) largely avoids lysosomes; under culture
conditions where fusion of
the salmonella-containing
vacuole (scv) to the lysosome was increased, the bacteria
were killed much more efficiently highlighting the impor-
tance of the harsh lysosomal environment as a mechanism
of innate immune defence (mukherjee et al., 2002).
for
many published reports show that lysosomes have the
capacity to kill and degrade bacteria, however, the exact
process by which bacteria are destroyed is multifactorial
and somewhat
ill deﬁned. lysosomal ph reaches
~4.8 which is damaging to non-acid tolerant bacteria, and
provides an optimal environment
lytic enzymes
present in the lysosome which include lipases, lysozyme
and proteases. it was recently reported that mice deﬁcient
in the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin d (ctsd)
showed increased susceptibility to listeria monocytoge-
nes infection, and bacterial growth and survival was
enhanced in ctsd–/– ﬁbroblasts and macrophages (del
cerro-vadillo et al., 2006). many lysosomal proteins, such
as cathepsin g, have demonstrated antibacterial activity
in vitro in puriﬁed form, but their individual roles in defence
against intracellular bacteria have not been rigorously
tested (rivera-marrero et al., 2004). interestingly, some
lytic enzymes including cathepsin g, can kill bacteria in
vitro independently of their catalytic function (shafer et al.,
1996). these proteins contain alpha helical domains that
are proposed to act similarly to small cationic antimicrobial
peptides (amp; discussed below).
lysozyme, a muramidase that degrades bacterial
peptidoglycan (pg),
is another lytic enzyme found in
phagolysosomes that may serve multiple intracellular

innate immune functions (miyauchi et al., 1985; radons
et al., 1994). first, weakening of the cell wall structure,
particularly in gram-positive bacteria which have a
thick pg layer, may allow better access of amp to the
bacterial membrane.

decreased the concentrations of amp required for bac-
terial killing (yan and hancock, 2001; chen et al., 2005).
second, release of muramyl peptides from the bacterial
cell wall by lysozyme in combination with other bacterial
or host lytic enzymes may provide ligands for recogni-
tion by host pattern recognition receptors that can regu-
late inﬂammatory responses (lenz et al., 2003; strober
et al., 2006). in support of this idea, mice deﬁcient in
lysosome m, the homologue of human lysozyme, exhib-
ited an altered inﬂammatory response compared with
control mice in response to subcutaneous injection of

that
lysozyme contributes to innate resistance during
infection by intracellular bacterial pathogens, but to date
there are no reports in the literature empirically testing
this hypothesis. lysm–/– mice were more susceptible
than their wild-type littermates to infection by extracellu-
lar bacteria;
future studies using intracellular bacterial
pathogens to infect lysm–/– mice will likely yield a deﬁni-
tive conclusion as to whether lysozyme is a key player in
innate resistance to this class of pathogens (ganz et al.,
2003; cole et al., 2005).
immune regulation of vesicular trafficking occurs during
bacterial infection to enhance intrinsic fusion of vacuoles
containing bacteria with lysosomes, although these
fig. 2. cell autonomous mechanisms of innate resistance to intracellular bacterial pathogens. sequential fusion of endosomes with late
endosomes and lysosomes results in bacterial killing by lytic enzymes and acidic ph. activated macrophages generate a rapid burst of
reactive oxygen intermediates (roi) in the phagosome by the nadph oxidase followed by a prolonged production of nitric oxide (no).
multiple efflux pumps remove divalent metal cations from the lumen of the phagosome, decreasing the ability of pathogens to use
metal-dependent enzymes to remediate oxidative stress or for metabolism. the phagosome also contains antimicrobial peptides, such as
cramp. although regulatory proteins such as lrg-47 enhance trafficking to lysosomes, some bacteria perforate the phagosome and enter
the cytosol prior to phagolysosome fusion. bacteria in the cytosol may re-enter the endocytic compartment through capture by autophagy
(regulated by a signalling cascade denoted atg) or may be subjected to putative cytosolic antimicrobial peptides (italics). host cells also
express ido in an ifn-dependent manner to catabolize cellular pools of tryptophan which may become limiting for some bacterial species.
other proteins that contribute to innate resistance to intracellular bacteria have been identiﬁed (ipaf, naip5, spa, ipr1), but exactly how these
proteins mediate their antimicrobial effects is not yet known.

mechanisms are incompletely understood. an ifn-g
induced gtpase, termed lrg-47, contributes to innate
resistance to m. tuberculosis (macmicking et al., 2003).
in lrg47–/– macrophages, mycobacterial phagosomes
showed impaired fusion with lysosomes, decreased levels
of vatpase and exhibited a higher ph than wild-type
macrophages, indicating that lrg-47 directly or indirectly
regulates vesicular trafficking. thus, the ability of the host
cell to restrict intracellular bacteria to the endocytic com-
partment and regulate the nature of the vacuolar environ-
ment subjects invading bacteria to attack by damaging
conditions such as low ph, and restricts nutrient access
while protecting normal host function.
reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates
professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neu-
trophils take up bacteria into a specialized vesicle known
as the phagosome which is the target for many innate
defence mechanisms. a particularly powerful host
defence is the oxidative burst produced by the nadph-
dependent phagocyte oxidase. humans with a non-
functional phagocyte oxidase exhibit immunodeﬁciency
characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections
(baehner and nathan, 1967). in resting cells, the phago-
cyte oxidase complex is present but dissociated and inac-
tive; one component, gp91phox (ﬂavocytochrome b558), is
located in the plasma membrane. upon phagocytosis, the
cytosolic components, p47phox, p67phox and p40phox, trans-
locate to the phagosome in a rac-dependent manner and
facilitate the formation of superoxide within the lumen of
the phagosome (nauseef, 2004). s. typhimurium inter-
feres with recruitment of oxidase components to the pha-
gosome via the spi-2 type iii secretion system (t3ss)
(vazquez-torres et al., 2000). in the absence of a func-
tional spi-2 t3ss, wild-type but not phox-deﬁcient mac-
rophages are able to restrict s. typhimurium infection
demonstrating a critical role for the napdh oxidase in
controlling intracellular bacterial growth.
bacterial
infection also stimulates the production of
reactive nitrogen intermediates (rni) by the inducible
nitric oxide synthase (inos). nos2, the gene encoding
inos, is not transcribed in uninfected cells, but can be
induced by type i and type ii interferons; therefore, nitric
oxide (no) production is not an immediate response to
infection. however, no, unlike reactive oxygen species,
diffuses across membranes and can act upon bacteria in
both vacuoles and the cytosol over a longer period of time
than the short-lived oxidative burst. mice deﬁcient in inos
are more susceptible to infection by many intracellular
pathogens than their wild-type counterparts (chakravortty
and hensel, 2003). the role of inos in human macroph-
ages has been more controversial. some groups reported
little or no detectable expression of
inos in cultured

intracellular
human macrophages, but other studies showed that mac-
rophages isolated from tuberculosis patients did express
inos, and inos function was critical in these cells during
in vitro infection (nathan, 2006). in mice, rni and reactive
oxygen intermediates (roi) can synergize in eliminating
the
s. typhimurium and
l. monocytogenes as gp91phox–/–nos2–/– mice are highly
susceptible to infections by these bacteria (shiloh et al.,
1999). however, cell culture infection of macrophages
deﬁcient in the phagocyte oxidase, inos or both, indi-
cated that production of roi was more critical in short-
term bacterial killing. roi and rni also prevent escape of
viable l. monocytogenes from the phagosome emphasiz-
ing that these molecules also contribute to innate resis-
tance by mechanisms other than direct bacterial killing
(myers et al., 2003).
antimicrobial peptides
small cationic peptides, or amp produced by diverse host
organisms can act as powerful antibacterial agents (yang
et al., 2004). these helical peptides are thought to pref-
erentially disrupt bacterial membranes leading to loss of
membrane potential and bacterial viability. amp are pri-
marily secreted proteins; the major sites of amp activity
are mucosal surfaces which can be portals for bacterial
entry. neutrophils also contain many granule associated
amp and proteins that are released by exocytosis to kill
extracellular bacteria or released into phagosomes to
destroy phagocytosed bacteria; these two types of killing
are not often experimentally distinct (faurschou and bor-
regaard, 2003). there are few amp that are deﬁnitively
known to act upon bacteria primarily within macrophages
and epithelial cells. here we discuss examples of amp
that may be encountered by intracellular bacterial
pathogens. one vacuolar amp from mouse myeloid cells
has been identiﬁed, cathelicidin-related antimicrobial
peptide (cramp; homologue of human ll-37), that con-
tributes to innate resistance to s. typhimurium infection
(gallo et al., 1997; rosenberger and finlay, 2002; rosen-
berger et al., 2004).
induction of cramp expression
requires generation of reactive oxygen, implicating roi in
innate immune signalling cascades as well as in direct
antimicrobial functions. in human monocytes, triggering
of
the tlr2/1 heterodimer activated a vitamin d3-
dependent induction of the cationic peptide ll-37 (the
active processed form of cathelicidin, human homologue
of cramp) (liu et al., 2006). colocalization of cathelicidin
with vacuoles containing m.
tuberculosis was also
observed concomitant with a decrease in bacterial
viability. in addition to cathelicidin, other lysosomal pro-
teins like cathepsin g and lysozyme contain positively
charged helical domains that are proposed to disrupt bac-
terial membranes similarly to small cationic peptides.

taken together, these studies show that amp play a role in
innate resistance to intracellular pathogens by acting on
bacteria sequestered within vacuolar compartments.
vacuolar amp would be effective against intracellular
bacteria that replicate in a membrane bound compart-
ment but would likely have limited efficacy against cyto-
solic pathogens such as l. monocytogenes which
quickly escapes from the phagosome. several groups
have identiﬁed cytosolic components, namely ubiquitin,
ubiquicidin, histones and hmgn2, that have antimicro-
bial activity in vitro, but as yet, it is unclear what role
these proteins play during intracellular infection. ubiq-
uitin is a small polypeptide that can be covalently linked
to proteins to regulate signalling, endocytosis or degra-
dation. it was recently shown that ubiquitin derived pep-
tides exhibited antibacterial activity in vitro (kieffer et al.,
2003). a distinct small polypeptide, ubiquicidin, was
originally characterized biochemically as an antimicrobial
activity isolated from the cytosol of ifn-g treated mouse
macrophages (hiemstra et al., 1999). further analysis
showed identity with the small ribosomal subunit, s30.
ubiquicidin has potent antimicrobial activity against
l. monocytogenes and s. typhimurium in vitro. however
no depletion or inhibition experiments have been per-
formed to show that the peptide functions to kill intrac-
ellular bacteria in infected macrophages or mice;
the
interpretation of such experiments might be complicated
by non-speciﬁc effects of ubiquicidin/s30 depletion on
normal cellular processes. this problem is reminiscent
of the dilemma associated with the discovery of the anti-
microbial
function of histones many decades ago
(hirsch, 1958). while the in vitro antibacterial activity of
histones was unquestioned, it was thought to be non-
speciﬁc and due to the highly basic nature of histones
that
it was unclear
whether histones had any physiological
role in the
immune response to bacterial
infections. recently, his-
tones and dna were shown to participate in bacterial
killing by neutrophil extracellular traps, or nets, where it
is unlikely that histones are required solely for participa-
tion in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation
(brinkmann et al., 2004; beiter et al., 2006; buchanan
et al., 2006). histones are found in the mammalian
cytosol as well as the nucleus and therefore may also
contribute to controlling cytosolic bacterial pathogens
(zlatanova et al., 1990). similarly, another dna binding
protein hmgn2, also reported to have antimicrobial
activity, is present in the cytosol and can be secreted
from human mononuclear leukocytes (feng et al., 2005).
host cells may proﬁt both metabolically and immuno-
logically by exploiting the biochemical properties
of abundant and readily available proteins such as
histones to kill bacteria that escape from the endocytic
compartment.
facilitate binding to dna. thus,
autophagy
escape of bacteria into the host cytosol, the storehouse
for many host nutrients, presents a signiﬁcant threat to the
host. most characterized mechanisms for innate resis-
tance to bacterial pathogens are directed within mem-
brane bound compartments, but host cells do have a
mechanism, termed autophagy, to capture particles in the
cytosol and surround them with a newly formed
membrane. the process and regulation of autophagy is
conserved from yeast to man and has been primarily
studied in the context of the cellular response to stress
and starvation (shintani and klionsky, 2004). however,
recent studies clearly show an important role for autoph-
agy in capturing and eliminating bacteria in the cytosol
(rich et al., 2003; nakagawa et al., 2004). the cytosolic
pathogen, shigella ﬂexneri, actively inhibits autophagy; a
strain deﬁcient in the virulence factor icsb was found
trapped in autophagosomes (ogawa et al., 2005). more-
over, autophagy facilitates elimination of pathogen-
containing vacuoles by fusion with lysosomes. this
process is enhanced by the ifn-g inducible gtpase
lrg-47 in the case of m. tuberculosis infection (gutierrez
et al., 2004; birmingham et al., 2006). it is as yet unclear
how autophagy is initiated by bacterial infection although
phosphoinositides participate in the regulatory process;
vacuolar membrane damage has been proposed as a
possible trigger (birmingham et al., 2006; lindmo and
stenmark, 2006). in the case of legionella pneumophila,
macrophage regulation of autophagy may mediate the
difference between resistance and permissiveness.
resistant c57bl/6 macrophages exhibit more rapid matu-
ration of pathogen containing autophagosomes than sus-
ceptible a/j macrophages which lack normal
levels of
naip5 (amer and swanson, 2005). autophagy is upregu-
lated by ifn-g treatment like many other mechanisms of
innate resistance.
in addition to a direct antimicrobial
function, autophagy also allows infected cells to capture
antigens from cytosolic pathogens for processing and pre-
sentation on mhc class ii (deretic, 2005; munz, 2006).
nutritional immunity
the host cell by necessity must contain all of the nutrients
required for its own metabolism, however, these stores
also are a rich source for bacterial pathogens to exploit.
thus, another major strategy for innate resistance to intra-
cellular infection is to sequester key nutrients such as iron
from the invading bacteria. iron is essential for many vital
processes of the host and bacterium, including metabo-
lism and protection from oxidative stress. although iron is
present in host cells, it is predominantly bound to proteins
and is virtually unavailable in free soluble form. upon
phagocytosis of a bacterium, iron can be removed from

the phagosome via multiple mechanisms. first, ferropor-
tin, nramp1 and nramp2 (dmt1) act as iron transporters
to move ferrous iron from the lumen of the phagosome
into the cytosol (forbes and gros, 2003; chlosta et al.,
2006). nramp1 also acts as a manganese efflux pump;
both manganese and iron can be used as co-ordinating
metal centres for bacterial proteins involved in protection
against oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase
(jabado et al., 2000; papp-wallace and maguire, 2006).
second, expression of transferrin receptor, a high affinity
receptor for iron that allows iron uptake from plasma, is
downregulated in response to ifn-g which decreases the
amount of iron in the phagosome (byrd and horwitz,
1989; 1993). coxiella burnetii overcomes the iron deﬁcit
by stimulating upregulation of transferrin receptor (howe
and mallavia, 1999). third, lactoferrin, an iron chelator
found in neutrophil granules, can be taken up into the
macrophage endocytic pathway from the extracellular
milieu and thereby decrease the concentration of avail-
able iron in the phagosome (byrd and horwitz, 1991).
hepcidin, a small amp which is essential for iron homeo-
stasis during normal host metabolism, also acts to
increase iron efflux in macrophages (peyssonnaux et al.,
2006). both fe2+ and mn2+ are critical for virulence of
many pathogens, such as s. typhimurium (boyer et al.,
2002). to enable replication, many intracellular bacteria
produce high affinity iron chelators, called siderophores,
which are able to steal iron from host proteins (de voss
et al., 2000; parent et al., 2002; fischbach et al., 2006).
host cells have in turn evolved innate immune mecha-
nisms to protect
iron acquisition by siderophores.
lipocalin-2, which is upregulated by tlr signalling, binds
siderophores of
the enterobactin family produced by
gram negative bacteria like s. typhimurium (flo et al.,
2004). thus, regulation of iron availability is central
in
determining the balance of the host–pathogen interaction.
intracellular bacteria must also acquire many other
nutrients to promote survival and replication. global gene
expression analysis has revealed that compared with
extracellular counterparts, intracellular bacteria upregu-
late genes characteristic of nutritional stress such as iron,
magnesium, glucose, amino acid and phosphate limita-
tion (chatterjee et al., 2006; jansen and yu, 2006). by
analogy to the extensive regulation of iron availability, it is
reasonable to speculate that other nutrients may be
sequestered by the host cell during infection, but few
relevant mechanisms have been described. one mecha-
nism of nutrient deprivation has been well established –
tryptophan catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
(ido). ido has two functions in innate immunity – a direct
role in nutrient deprivation during intracellular infection
and a role in negative regulation of t cell activation
(thomas et al., 1993; beatty et al., 1994; mellor and
ido by ifn-g restricted
munn, 2004). upregulation of

growth of chlamydia trachomatis; the bacteriostatic effect
was abrogated by inhibition or deﬁciency of ido or by
addition of excess tryptophan. interfering with bacterial
metabolism is a powerful strategy to restrict bacterial
growth. future studies may identify additional mecha-
nisms by which host cells modulate nutrient availability.
future questions
innate immune control of intracellular bacterial pathogens
depends on diverse, overlapping and redundant mecha-
nisms to ensure survival of the host until the onset of
adaptive immunity. while innate immune recognition and
signalling by tlr and nlr proteins have been explored in
exquisite molecular detail, how these sensors may trigger
direct antimicrobial mechanisms is for the most part poorly
deﬁned. two members of the nlr family, naip5 (also
called birc1e) and ipaf (also termed clan), which rec-
ognize cytosolic bacterial ﬂagellin, exert a protective
effect against macrophage infection by l. pneumophila
and s. typhimurium (diez et al., 2003; wright et al., 2003;
molofsky et al., 2006; ren et al., 2006; zamboni et al.,
2006). the bacterial ﬂagellin likely contaminates the host
cytosol via bacterial secretion systems, such as the type
iii or type iv systems, that translocate virulence factors
across the vacuolar membrane. these data demonstrate
that naip5 and ipaf contribute to important mechanisms
of bacterial control but exactly how is unclear. it is para-

they may serve to
growth of vacuolar pathogens but

to non-
pathogenic vacuole-bound bacteria that present no
danger to the host. as there are members of the nlr
family that have not yet been extensively investigated, the
possibility remains that some additional nlrs will also be
important in preventing bacterial replication, while others,
such as nod1, may function primarily as regulators of
inﬂammation.
that cytosolic detection systems act
inappropriate immune responses
other regulators of innate immune control of bacterial
replication that remain to be explored are ipr1, lxra and
spa. ipr1, an interferon inducible gene, was identiﬁed
genetically as a locus that controls resistance to m. tuber-
culosis infection in macrophages, mice and possibly
humans (pan et al., 2005; tosh et al., 2006). the closest
human homologue to ipr1 is sp110b, a protein that con-
tains chromatin binding and nuclear localization domains,
which may act as a cofactor for nuclear receptors to
regulate transcription (bloch et al., 2000). tontonoz and
colleagues reported that lxra, a nuclear receptor of the
liver x receptor family, regulates cholesterol metabolism
and resistance to the cytosolic pathogen, l. monocytoge-
nes (joseph et al., 2004). spa, a scavenger receptor
cystine rich repeat protein, was identiﬁed as an lxra
target gene that contributed to antibacterial activity. spa

has been implicated in protection from apoptosis, but a
recent study suggested that spa could also act as a
pattern recognition receptor for lipopolysaccharide (lps)
(sarrias et al., 2005). because l. monocytogenes has no
lps, the defect in antibacterial function associated with the
absence of lxra and spa in l. monocytogenes infection
cannot be explained by lps recognition but implicates
some other role of spa yet to be determined. it is apparent
that we have much to learn about the many mechanisms by
which host cells orchestrate innate immune control of
bacterial pathogens that exploit the intracellular niche. an
increased understanding of intracellular innate immune
resistance may provide important clues about how to
design more effective vaccines and therapeutic strategies
to combat bacterial pathogens.
