macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a well-conserved intracellular 
degradation process. recent studies examining cells lacking the autophagy genes atg5 
and atg7 have demonstrated that autophagy plays essential roles in cell survival during 
starvation, in innate cell clearance of microbial pathogens, and in neural cell maintenance. 
however, the role of autophagy in t lymphocyte development and survival is not known. 
here, we demonstrate that autophagosomes form in primary mouse t lymphocytes. by genera-
ting atg5−/− chimeric mice, we found that atg5-defi cient t lymphocytes underwent full 
maturation. however, the numbers of total thymocytes and peripheral t and b lymphocytes 
were reduced in atg5 chimeras. in the periphery, atg5−/− cd8+ t lymphocytes displayed 
dramatically increased cell death. furthermore, atg5−/− cd4+ and cd8+ t cells failed to 
undergo effi cient proliferation after tcr stimulation. these results demonstrate a critical 
role for atg5 in multiple aspects of lymphocyte development and function and suggest 
that autophagy may be essential for both t lymphocyte survival and proliferation.
macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-
mediated  autophagy  are  conserved  catabolic 
processes in eukaryotic cells that deliver cyto-
plasmic  material  to  lysosomes  (1).  macroau-
tophagy  (hereafter  referred  to  as  autophagy) 
is  uniquely  defi ned  by  the  formation  of 
 autophagosomes,  double  membrane  vesicles 
0.5–1.5 μm in diameter arising through the 
elongation  of  a  cup-shaped  isolation  mem-
brane around cellular cargo (1). a screen of yeast 
mutants incapable of surviving nitrogen starva-
tion has identifi ed a network of atg genes im-
portant  for  the  formation  of  autophagosomes 
(2).  homologues  of  these  genes  have  been 
identifi ed and characterized in the mammalian 
system.  although  autophagy  has  been  long 
recognized,  only  recently  have  its  essential 
roles in various cellular functions been estab-
lished  (3,  4).  for  example,  mice  lacking  the 
autophagy  gene  atg5  or  atg7  cannot  with-
stand short periods of starvation and display 
 severe neurodegenerative disease (5–7). auto-
phagy  is  also  essential  for  maintaining  cell 
 survival  after  growth  factor  withdrawal  (8). 
furthermore,  autophagy  contributes  to  the 
clearance  of  intracellular  pathogens  includ-
ing group  a  streptococcus  and  mycobacterium 
 tuberculosis (9, 10).
autophagy is initiated through a well-con-
served molecular pathway. class iii phosphati-
dylinoside 3-kinase in complex with beclin-1 
(yeast atg6) induces autophagosome formation 
(11, 12). two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems 
downstream  of  beclin-1–phosphatidylinoside 
3-kinase  are  important  for  the  induction  of 
 autophagy. the terminal products of one of 
these two pathways, an atg5–atg12 covalent 
complex, is required for the elongation of the 
isolation membrane (13). the second pathway re-
sults in the conjugation of microtubule-associated 
protein  1  light  chain  3  (lc3;  yeast  atg8)  to 
phospholipids for incorporation into the auto-
phagosome membrane (14).
although  autophagy  is  important  for  sur-
vival during periods of nutrient deprivation (5), 
its role in regulating cellular life and death deci-
sions remains largely unknown (for review see 
reference 15). the induction of autophagy may 
either program or prevent cell death (3, 4, 16). 
regardless, the regulation of autophagy and 
apoptosis  is  likely  to  be  linked  at  the  mole-
cular level. the autophagy protein beclin-1 
binds to antiapoptotic bcl-2 family proteins, 
including  bcl-xl  and  bcl-2  (17).  atg5  in-
teracts  with  fas-associated  via  death  domain 
(fadd), a death receptor adaptor protein (18).

autophagy-dependent death occurs in cells whose apoptotic 
machinery has been disabled (19, 20).
although innate immune cells, such as macrophages, use 
autophagy  to  clear  microbial  pathogens,  it  is  not  known 
whether autophagy has a role in the adaptive immune system. 
only recently has evidence emerged that t cells may be ca-
pable of inducing autophagy. human t lymphocytes stimu-
lated and cultured in vitro form autophagosomes as identifi ed 
by transmission electron microscopy (21). cd4+ human um-
bilical cord t cells also can be induced to form autophago-
somes by the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein (22). yet a role 
for autophagy in t cells remains undefi ned.
to study the role of autophagy in t lymphocyte devel-
opment and function, we fi rst assessed the induction of auto-
phagy in primary mouse t lymphocytes. we then generated 
autophagy-defi cient  lymphocytes  by  transferring  atg5−/− 
 fetal  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells  into  lethally  irradiated 
wild-type congenic hosts. we found that atg5−/− lympho-
cytes exhibit multiple defects, including a reduced lympho-
cyte compartment, enhanced cd8+ t cell apoptosis, and an 
inability to undergo tcr-induced proliferation. our results 
suggest that autophagy may play an essential role in t lym-
phocyte survival and function.
results and discussion
autophagy in mouse t lymphocytes
recent  reports  suggest  that  thymocytes  (19)  and  cultured 
human lymphocytes (21, 22) are capable of inducing  autophagy. 
to  determine  whether  primary  mouse  t  cells  can  form 
 autophagosomes, we took three approaches. first, to deter-
mine if t lymphocytes express autophagy machinery, thy-
mocytes and peripheral t cells were double sorted (>99% 
pure) and total rna was isolated. semiquantitative rt-
pcr  was  performed  to  detect  the  expression  of  atg5, 
beclin-1  (yeast  atg6),  and  lc3  (yeast  atg8)  (fig.  1  a). 
 expression of these essential autophagy genes could be de-
tected in both thymocytes and mature t cells. in the thymus, 
atg5, beclin-1, and lc3 were most highly expressed in the 
double negative (dn) compartment. in the periphery, both 
cd4+  and  cd8+  t  cells  expressed  autophagy  machinery. 
this expression was maintained after 2 d of in vitro stimula-
tion with anti-cd3.
next,  to  determine  if  autophagosomes  are  present  in 
t lymphocytes, we purifi ed cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from 
the spleen and lymph nodes of naive mice (≥96% pure). using 
transmission electron microscopy, we could identify charac-
teristic double membrane autophagosomes in both t cell 
figure 1.  atg5−/− thymocytes are reduced in number but develop 
normally. (a) rag-2−/− dn thymocytes, sorted dp, cd4+ sp, cd8+ sp, and 
peripheral t cell subsets from c57bl/6 mice were analyzed for the expres-
sion of autophagy genes by semiquantitative rt-pcr. both sorted cd4+ 
and cd8+ peripheral t cells were activated in vitro for 2 d with anti-cd3 
and subjected to rt-pcr analysis. (b) transmission electron microscopy 
of peripheral t cells. freshly isolated (f) and anti-cd3–activated (a) cd4+ 
and cd8+ t cells (n = 50) were cross sectioned and analyzed for the 
presence of autophagosomes (arrows). activated cells were cultured in 
vitro for 2 d with anti-cd3. (c) t cell immunoblot for lc3. purifi ed t cells 
from c57bl/6 mice were either immediately lysed or amino acid starved 
in vitro for 4 h in a balanced salt solution, or stimulated with plate-bound 
anti-cd3 with or without hil-2 (100 u/ml) for 16 h. the lysates were 
probed for lc3 processing. actin serves as a loading control. (d) total

populations (fig. 1 b). quantifi cation revealed that ⵑ10% 
of cd4+ and cd8+ t cell cross sections contained autopha-
gosomes (fig. 1 b). we also analyzed autophagosome for-
mation in t cells purifi ed after in vitro stimulation for 2 d 
with anti-cd3. approximately 30% of activated cell cross 
sections  contained  autophagosomes  (fig.  1  b).  however, 
the narrow depth of the section does not allow us to distin-
guish between an increase in the number of autophagosome 
per cell and an increase in the number of autophagosome-
positive cells.
finally,  we  used  immunoblotting  for  lc3  to  detect 
 autophagy  in  t  cells.  lc3  undergoes  regulated  modifi ca-
tions during the induction of autophagy, delivering a faster 
migrating  processed  band  (termed  lc3-ii)  to  autophago-
somes (14). although a small amount of lc3-ii was present 
in freshly purifi ed peripheral t cells, the ratio of lc3-ii to 
lc3-i was increased after 4 h of amino acid starvation in a 
balanced  salt  solution  and  after  anti-cd3–induced  t  cell 
activation with or without exogenous il-2 (fig. 1 c). col-
lectively, these three results suggest that primary t lympho-
cytes form autophagosome and can regulate the induction 
of autophagy.
thymocyte development in atg5−/− chimeras
to determine the role of autophagy-related genes in t cell 
development and function, we reconstituted the immune 
system of adult mice with autophagy-defi cient hematopoi-
etic  precursors  from  mice  lacking  atg5  (5).  atg5-defi cient 
mice  die  within  24  h  of  birth  because  of  their  inability  to 
survive brief periods of nutrient deprivation. we generated 
chimeric  mice  by  transferring  day  14  fetal  liver  cells  from 
atg5−/− and wild-type mice into lethally irradiated (950 rad) 
cd45.1+ congenic hosts. we analyzed the thymus of atg5−/− 
and  wild-type  chimeras  by  fl ow  cytometry  6–10  wk  after 
 reconstitution.  in  all  chimeric  mice,  >99%  of  thymocytes 
recovered  were  cd45.2+  (unpublished  data),  indicating  a 
complete reconstitution by donor-derived cells. when com-
pared  with  wild-type  controls,  atg5−/−  chimeras  demon-
strated a 40–60% reduction in their total thymic cellularity 
(fig. 1 d). although the number of atg5−/− thymocytes was 
reduced, the developmental profi le of cells within the thy-
mus appeared normal (fig. 1 e). atg5−/− chimeras had nor-
mal  percentages  of  cd4−cd8−  dn,  cd8+cd4+  double 
positive (dp), cd4+ single positive (sp), and cd8+ sp cells. 
furthermore,  the  progressive  subsets  within  the  dn  com-
partment as defi ned by the expression of cd25 and cd44 
were  comparable  between  atg5−/−  and  wild-type  control 
thymus. atg5−/− thymocytes did not exhibit enhanced apop-
tosis  as  detected  by  annexin  v  and  7–aminoactinomycin 
d (7-aad) staining (fig. 1 f). collectively, these results 
 demonstrate that atg5-defi cient thymocytes underwent full 
maturation  without  any  obvious  developmental  blockade, 
suggesting that atg5 is dispensable in thymocyte diff erentiation. 
the reduced thymic cellularity may be caused by reduced 
lymphoid  precursor  activity  in  the  absence  of  atg5  (see 
following paragraph).
brief definitive report
reduced peripheral lymphocyte compartment 
in atg5−/− chimeras
we  examined  the  peripheral  lymphocyte  compartment  of 
chimeric  mice  6–10  wk  after  fetal  liver  reconstitution. 
cd45.2+  donor-derived  cd4+  and  cd8+  t  lymphocytes 
were detected in the spleen of both atg5−/− and wild-type 
chimeras (fig. 2 a). atg5−/− t cells expressed similar levels 
of tcr on their surface compared with control cells (fig. 
2 a). however, the total numbers of atg5−/− t and b lym-
phocytes in the spleen were only ⵑ10% of control chimeras 
(fig.  2  b).  in  addition,  the  total  number  of  cells  obtained 
from the lns of atg5−/− chimeras was 10% of that in control 
mice (atg5−/−: 0.83 + 0.8 × 106, n = 4; control: 8.2 + 6 × 
106,  n  =  3).  in  contrast,  the  number  of  atg5−/−  gr-
1+cd11b+ neutrophils in the spleen was comparable to that 
of controls (fig. 2 b), suggesting that atg5−/− lymphoid 
 progenitors have a defective capacity to reconstitute the lym-
phoid compartment.
interestingly,  although  the  numbers  of  both  atg5−/− 
cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes were dramatically reduced 
(fig. 2 c), the reduction of atg5−/− cd8+ t lymphocytes 
(5% of control cells) was more severe than that of atg5−/− 
cd4+ t lymphocytes (10% of control cells) (fig. 2 a and c). 
this was further indicated by the elevated cd4+ to cd8+ 
ratio  of  atg5−/−  t  lymphocytes  compared  with  that  of

 control t cells (fig. 2 d). although the number of thymocytes 
in atg5−/− chimeras is reduced, this dramatic and selective 
reduction in peripheral t lymphocytes suggests a role for auto-
phagy in mature t cells.
selective survival defect in atg5−/− cd8+ t cells
the  process  of  autophagy  is  intimately  linked  to  survival. 
atg5  was  fi rst  identifi ed  in  a  screen  for  yeast  incapable  of 
surviving nitrogen starvation (2). given that cd8+ t cells 
exhibited  a  more  severe  reduction  than  cd4+  t  cells  in 
atg5−/− chimeras, we examined whether atg5 was required 
for mature cd8+ t cell survival in vivo. in freshly isolated 
splenocytes, <10% of wild-type but nearly 40% of atg5−/− 
cd8+ t cells were annexin v+7-aad− (fig. 3 a), indicat-
ing that these cells had initiated apoptosis in vivo. further-
more, the total apoptotic rate of atg5−/− cd8+ t cells as 
indicated by annexin v+7-aad− and annexin v+7-aad+ 
staining  was  fi ve  to  six  times  higher  than  that  of  control 
cd8+ t cells (fig. 3, a and b). in contrast, the apoptotic 
rates of atg5−/− cd4+ t lymphocytes and b220+ b lym-
phocytes  were  only  slightly  higher  than  those  of  control 
cells, whereas the apoptotic rate of atg5−/− gr-1+ neutro-
phils was similar to that of control cells (fig. 3 b). because 
a small fraction of host peripheral cd4+ and cd8+ t lym-
phocytes  survived  the  lethal  irradiation,  we  examined  the 
apoptosis in these cells as an internal control. the apoptotic 
rates of cd4+ t lymphocytes from either wild-type and 
atg5−/−  donors  or  c57bl/6  congenic  hosts  were  com-
parable (fig. 3 c). however, the apoptotic rates of atg5−/− 
cd8+ t cells were dramatically higher than those of either 
wild-type cd8+ or host long-lived cd8+ t cells (fig. 3 c). 
this result suggests that atg5, and perhaps the ability to in-
duce autophagy, is required for the survival of cd8+ t cells. 
interestingly, we noticed that the apoptotic rates of cd4+ 
and cd8+ host t cells in atg5−/− chimeras were also slightly 
higher than those of their counterparts in wild-type chime-
ras (fig. 3 c). whether this elevation is indirectly caused by 
the massive apoptosis of atg5−/− cd8+ t cells remains to 
be determined.
our results suggest that the survival defect seems to be 
specifi c to peripheral t cells. not only do atg5−/− cd8+ sp 
thymocytes develop normally (fig. 1 e), but atg5−/− cd8+ 
sp thymocytes do not display an enhanced rate of apoptosis 
in vivo compared with wild-type controls (fig. 1 f). how 
does atg5 contribute to the survival of cd8+ t cells? one 
possibility  is  that  peripheral  cd8+  t  cells  depend  on  au-
tophagy for their survival. this is consistent with the expres-
sion of autophagy genes and presence of autophagosomes in 
these  cells.  this  possibility  implies  that  cd8+  t  cells  en-
counter either a nutrient shortage or cytokine deprivation or 
both after they exit the thymus. growth factor deprivation–
induced  autophagy  has  been  shown  to  be  critical  for  cell 
 survival (8). given that cd4+ t cells also express autophagy 
machinery and form autophagosomes, it is interesting to see 
that  cd4+  t  cell  survival  is  less  dependent  on  atg5  than 
cd8+ t cells.

alternatively, atg5 may regulate cd8+ t cell survival by 
interacting with antiapoptotic molecules. published data have 
demonstrated  a  pattern  of  reciprocal  relationships  between 
autophagy  and  apoptosis.  both  the  inhibition  of  apoptosis 
can induce autophagy (19, 20, 23), and the inhibition of au-
tophagy can induce apoptosis (24). molecular and functional 
studies have only begun to explore the complex relationship 
between autophagy and apoptosis. the mammalian atg6 
 homologue, beclin-1, was fi rst identifi ed as a bcl-2–bcl-xl 
interacting protein (17); however, the role of this interaction 
remains  controversial.  bcl-2  has  been  shown  to  inhibit 
autophagosome formation in nutrient-starved yeast and hu-
man cancer cell lines (25), yet bcl-2 expression in bax−/−
bak−/− mouse embryonic fi broblasts enhances autophagy 
 after  etoposide treatment (19). in each of these in vitro studies, 
autophagy  was  required  for  the  observed  cellular  death. 
however,  the  massive  apoptosis  we  observe  in  atg5−/− 
cd8+ t cells suggests that the capacity to induce autophagy 
in these cells is essential for their survival in vivo. whether 
direct  interactions  between  autophagy  and  apoptotic  ma-
chinery  contribute  to  the  enhanced  apoptosis  in  atg5−/− 
cd8+ t cells will be an important area of future study.

impaired proliferation of atg5−/− t lymphocytes 
to tcr stimulation
next, we examined whether atg5−/− t cells respond nor-
mally to tcr stimulation. total splenocytes from atg5−/− 
and wild-type chimeras were labeled with the fl uorescent dye 
cfse. after 3 d of anti-cd3 stimulation, 7-aad− cd45.2+ 
donor-derived t cells were analyzed by fl ow cytometry for 
proliferation as measured by cfse dilution. although 42% 
of wild-type cd4+ t cells proliferated in response to plate-
bound anti-cd3, only 9% of atg5−/− cd4+ t cells prolifer-
ated (fig. 4 a). in addition, the number of divisions within 
the  dividing  population  was  reduced  in  atg5−/−  t  cells. 
measured  by  the  mean  fl uorescence  intensity,  the  dilution 
of cfse was greater in dividing wild-type t cells than in 
atg5−/− cells. these proliferation defects could be rescued by 
neither  the  addition  of  an  anti-cd28  costimulatory  signal 
nor the proproliferative cytokine il-2. when we bypassed 
membrane-proximal  tcr/cd3  signaling  by  the  use  of 
pma and ionomycin, 49% of atg5−/− cd4+ t cells prolif-
erated compared with 69% of wild-type controls; however, 
the dilution of cfse in dividing cells remained reduced 
in  atg5−/−  t  cells  (fig.  4  a).  these  results  suggest  that 
downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and 
calcium mobilization can partially rescue the proliferation defect 
in atg5−/− cd4+ t lymphocytes. similar results were ob-
tained for atg5−/− cd8+ t cells (unpublished data).
although atg5−/− t cells did not proliferate in response 
to cd3 stimulation, they did express normal levels of tcr 
(fig. 2 a). after overnight stimulation, both wild-type and 
atg5−/− t cells also expressed similar levels of the activation 
markers cd69 and cd25 (fig. 4 b). this result suggests that 
atg5−/− t cells can be activated through the tcr complex. 
given that atg5−/− cd8+ t cells displayed a survival defect, 
we  determined  whether  enhanced  apoptosis  in  activated 
atg5−/− t cells might account for the reduced number of 
proliferating cells. at 4 and 24 h after stimulation, atg5−/− 
cd4+ t cells did not display a dramatically enhanced rate 
of apoptosis compared with wild-type controls (fig. 4 c). 
however, at 72 h we did observe an increased death in anti-
cd3–stimulated  atg5−/−  cd4+  t  cells.  we  observed  the 
same result for atg5−/− cd8+ t cells, although the baseline 
rate  of  cell  death  was  dramatically  enhanced  in  these  cells. 
the absence of early death after tcr stimulation in t cells 
lacking the autophagy gene atg5 suggests that the enhanced

staining. data are representative of two experiments.

death observed at 72 h may result from the impaired activa-
tion of these cells. although it is also possible that proliferat-
ing  atg5−/−  t  cells  rely  on  autophagy  to  maintain  their 
metabolism late in culture, the addition of the cell-permeable 
metabolic substrate methylpyruvate did not enhance our re-
covery of proliferating atg5−/− t lymphocytes (unpublished 
data). it should be noted that at 72 h very few atg5−/− cd8+ 
t cells were detected in the culture without anti-cd3 stimu-
lation and the apoptotic rate cannot be assessed.
although  autophagy  has  emerging  roles  in  cellular  sur-
vival and death, no specifi c function in proliferation has been 
identifi ed.  our  results  clearly  demonstrate  that  in  activated 
cd4+ and cd8+ t cells atg5 is essential for t cell prolifera-
tion  but  not  activation.  it  will  be  important  to  determine 
how  the  induction  of  autophagy  is  regulated  during  tcr 
stimulation. although atg5 is required for the induction of 
autophagy in mouse cells (1), it is also possible that atg5 may 
serve an autophagy-independent role in t cell proliferation. 
atg5 interacts with the death domain of the adaptor protein 
fadd  (18).  in  hela  cells,  this  interaction  is  required  for 
ifn-γ–mediated autophagic cell death. fadd-defi cient t cells 
display a defect in proliferation, with normal up-regulation of 
activation markers (26, 27). this similarity suggests that atg5 
and fadd may act together, either in the autophagic process 
or independent of autophagy, to transduce signals important 
for t cell proliferation.
in summary, our results demonstrate that the autophagy 
gene atg5 plays multiple roles in lymphocyte development 
and  function.  the  reduced  number  of  thymocytes  and  b 
lymphocytes suggests that atg5 regulates lymphoid precursor 
activity. the reduced cd4+ and cd8+ t cell compartment 
in atg5−/− chimeras is likely caused by both a lowered lym-
phoid precursor activity and an inability of these cells to un-
dergo  homeostatic  proliferation  because  during  fetal  liver 
reconstitutions, there is a transient period of lymphopenia in 
the host after irradiation. in addition, the selective apoptosis 
of atg5−/− cd8+ t cells further contribute to the dramati-
cally reduced t cell compartment. our results suggest that 
autophagy may play an essential role in t lymphocyte sur-
vival and proliferation.

(5). the mice were backcrossed for seven generations to c57bl/6. 6–8-wk-
old cd45.1 c57bl/6 mice were used as hosts for fetal liver transfers (the 
jackson laboratory). all mice were housed in a specifi c pathogen-free faci-
lity and used according to protocols approved by the duke university insti-
tutional animal care and use committee.
rt-pcr. thymocytes and peripheral t cells were isolated from c57bl/6 
mice by fl uorescence-activated cell sorting (99% pure), and total rna from 106 
cells was extracted with an rneasy mini kit (qiagen). dn thymocytes were 
isolated from rag-2−/− mice, and activated t cells were generated by culturing 
sorted peripheral t cells for 2 d with 5 μg/ml plate-bound anti-cd3. first-
strand cdna was reverse transcribed with the iscript reverse transcriptase kit 
(bio-rad laboratories). the expression of autophagy genes was determined 
by rt-pcr using the following primers: atg5, 5′-g a c a a a g a t g t g-
c t t c g a g a t g t g -3′  and  5′-g t a g c t c a g a t g c t c g c t c a g -3′;

and 5′-a g a g t g g g a g t t g c t g t t g a a g -3′.
transmission  electron  microscopy.  cd4+  and  cd8+  t  cells  were 
purifi ed from the spleen and lymph node of c57bl6 mice (≥96% pure) 
using easysep negative bead selection (stemcell technologies). activated 
cells were stimulated for 2 d in vitro with 5 μg/ml soluble anti-cd3 before 
purifi cation.  cell  pellets  were  fi xed  in  a  4%  gluteraldehyde  in  0.1  m 
sodium  cacodylate  buff er  overnight.  the  samples  were  rinsed  in  0.1  m 
cacodylate buff er containing 7.5% sucrose three times for 15 min each and 
fi xed in 1% osmium in cacodylate buff er for 1 h. after being washed three 
times in 0.11 m veronal acetate buff er for 15 min each, the samples were 
incubated with 0.5% uranyl acetate in veronal acetate buff er for 1 h at rt. 
specimens were then dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol (35%, 
70%,  95%,  and  2  changes  of  100%)  for  10  min  each,  followed  by  two 
changes of propylene oxide for 5 min each. the samples were incubated 
with a 1:1 mixture of 100% resin and propylene oxide for 1 h, followed 
by two  changes  of  100%  resin,  each  for  30  min.  finally,  the  samples 
were embedded in resin and polymerized at 60°c overnight. thick sec-
tions (0.5 μm) were cut and stained with toluidine blue for light micro-
scopy selection of the appropriate area for ultrathin sections. thin sections 
(60–90  nm)  were  cut,  mounted  on  copper  grids,  and  then  stained  with 
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. micrographs were taken with a philips ls 
410 electron microscope.
western  blot.  total  t  cells  were  purifi ed  from  the  spleen  and  lymph 
node of c57bl6 mice (≥96% pure) using easysep negative bead selection 
(stemcell  technologies).  the  cells  were  lysed  in  50  mm  tris,  ph  6.8, 
10% glycerol, 2% sds, and 100 mm dithioreitol. lc3 was visualized using 
a  rabbit  polyclonal  antibody  (from  ron  kopito,  stanford  university, 
 stanford, ca), hrp-conjugated donkey anti–rabbit (jackson immuno-
research  laboratories),  and  femto  chemiluminescent  substrate  (pierce 
chemical co.).
generation of chimeric mice. fetuses were harvested from day 14 atg5 
heterozygous pregnant female mice. dna was isolated from 106 fetal liver 
cells using a dneasy tissue kit (qiagen) for genotyping. the primers for the 
wild-type and deletion allele of the atg5 gene were 5′-g a a t a t g a a g g-
c a c a c c c c t g a a a t g -3′, 5′-a c a a c g t c g a g c a c a g c t g c g c a-
a g g -3′, and 5′-g t a c t g c a t a a t g g t t t a a c t c t t g c -3′, and the 
pcrs were performed at 94°c for 30 s, 58°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 1 min 
for 30 cycles. 1–3 × 106 liver cells from wild-type and atg5−/− fetuses were 
injected into lethally irradiated (950 rad) cd45.1 congenic hosts. chimeric 
mice were analyzed 6–10 wk after reconstitution.
flow  cytometry  analysis.  single  cell  suspensions  of  spleen  and  thymus 
were lysed of rbcs and incubated with fcr blocker (2.4g2; ebioscience). 
cells were incubated with fitc, pe, pe/cy5, apc, and biotinylated anti-
bodies  followed  by  streptavidin-alexa  594  for  30  min  on  ice.  antibodies 
used included anti-cd4, -cd8, -tcr-β, -b220, -gr1, -mac1, -cd25, 
-cd69, and -cd45.2 (ebioscience, biolegend, and bd biosciences). dead 
cells were excluded by 7-aad or propidium iodide staining (bd bio-
sciences). cell events were collected on a facs star and analyzed using 
cell  quest  software  (becton  dickinson).  apoptotic  cells  were  assayed  by 
annexin v–pe kit and 7-aad staining (bd biosciences).
cell  proliferation.  splenocytes  were  labeled  with  cfse  (molecular 
probes)  and  stimulated  with  5  μg/ml  plate-bound  anti-cd3  (2c11).  in 
some cultures, plate-bound anti-cd28 (clone 37.51; biolegend) or human 
recombinant il-2 was added. proliferation was assayed by fl ow cytometry 
after 3 d.
