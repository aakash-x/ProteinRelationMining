nutrients and bioenergetics are prerequisites for proliferation 
and survival of mammalian cells1,2. we present evidence 
that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, is 
phosphorylated at thr 198 downstream of the peutz-jeghers 
syndrome protein–amp-activated protein kinase (lkb1–ampk) 
energy-sensing pathway, thereby increasing p27 stability 
and directly linking sensing of nutrient concentration and 
bioenergetics to cell-cycle progression. ectopic expression of 
wild-type and phosphomimetic thr 198 to asp 198 (t198d), 
but not unstable thr 198 to ala 198 (p27t198a) is sufficient 
to induce autophagy. under stress conditions that activate the 
lkb1–ampk pathway with subsequent induction of autophagy, 
p27 knockdown results in apoptosis. thus lkb1–ampk 
pathway-dependent phosphorylation of p27 at thr 198 
stabilizes p27 and permits cells to survive growth factor 
withdrawal and metabolic stress through autophagy. this may 
contribute to tumour-cell survival under conditions of growth 
factor deprivation, disrupted nutrient and energy metabolism, 
or during stress of chemotherapy.
growth  factor  signalling  through  the  phosphatidylinositol  3  kinase 
(pi(3)k) pathway increases uptake of glucose and amino acids, thus 
preparing cells for the metabolic needs of cell growth and prolifera-
tion3,4. metabolic stress results in a decline in atp:adp ratios with a 
subsequent accumulation of amp. ampk, which is activated by amp 
and the peutz-jeghers syndrome gene product lkb1, functions as an 
intracellular energy sensor regulating metabolism and cell proliferation 
through phosphorylation of acetyl coa carboxylase (acc) and tumour 
suppressors, including tuberin (tsc2) and p53 (refs 5–7).
under  conditions  of  reduced  nutrient  availability,  autophagy  (an 
evolutionarily conserved process wherein catabolism of intracellular 
organelles generates energy) allows cell survival. however, prolonged 
autophagy can lead to non-apoptotic type ii programmed cell death8–10. 
dysregulation of autophagy contributes to a number of pathological 
conditions including tumorigenesis8.
p27 inhibits the kinase activity of cyclin–cdk holoenzymes, particu-
larly cyclin e–cdk2, resulting in cell-cycle arrest11. however, p27 also reg-
ulates motility and cell survival, suggesting that its role extends beyond 
cell-cycle regulation12. p27 abundance is governed by transcription, 
translation, phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis13–15. 
phosphorylation also regulates p27 subcellular localization13,14,16–18, with 
cytosolic sequestration of p27 limiting its nuclear functions.
to identify p27 phosphorylation sites, p27 mutant alleles were trans-
fected into mcf-7 cells and two-dimensional phosphopeptide map-
ping performed. seven phosphopeptides were detected in wild-type 
yfp–p27 (fig. 1a), flag-tagged and endogenous p27 (data not shown). 
spots a and b were absent in yfp–p27t198a (fig. 1a) but present when 
ser 7, ser 10, ser 12 and thr 157 were converted to alanine. yfp–p27 
and yfp–p27t198a mixtures showed seven spots identical to yfp–p27 
(fig. 1a). the presence of two distinct spots containing phosphothreo-
nine exclusively (fig. 1b) suggests alternative trypsin digestion of the 
amino-acid sequence 190-kpglrrrqt-198. antibodies raised against 
phospho-thr 198 demonstrated strong reactivity towards yfp–p27 with 
minimal reactivity with yfp–p27t198a, confirming antibody specificity 
and thr 198 phosphorylation in asynchronous mcf-7 cells (fig. 1c).
to characterize the role of thr 198 phosphorylation in p27 function, 
mcf-7 cells were transfected with wild-type p27, p27t198a or p27t198d. 
the frequency of fluorescent cells was strikingly lower (4–5-fold) with 
yfp–p27t198a compared with yfp–p27 (fig. 1d). the proteasome inhibi-
tor mg132 equalized the frequency of yfp–p27 and yfp–p27t198a positive 
cells (fig. 1d and see supplementary information, fig. s1a). in addi-
tion, after cotransfection with rfp, 60% of rfp-positive cells expressed

yfp–p27 or yfp–p27t198d, whereas yfp–p27t198a was detected in only 10% 
of cells and at greatly reduced levels. mg132 increased the frequency of 
rfp and yfp–p27t198a coexpression (95%), as well as fluorescent intensity, 
of yfp–p27t198a (fig. 1e). yfp–p27t198a half-life, determined by cyclohex-
imide  chase,  was  markedly  reduced  compared  with  yfp–p27,  yfp–
p27t198d or endogenous p27 (fig. 1f and see supplementary information, 
fig. s1b). decreased stability of p27t198a also occurred with rfp-tagged 
p27 constructs (see supplementary information, fig. s1c) and in u2os 
osteosarcoma cells (see supplementary information, fig. s1d).
in  mcf-7  cells,  yfp–p27t198d  demonstrated  similar  stability  to 
wild-type  p27,  possibly  because  of  constitutive  thr 198  phosphor-
ylation.  however  in  hela  cells,  which  have  low  levels  of  p-thr 198 
p27, yfp–p27t198d was expressed at higher levels than yfp–p27 (see 
supplementary information, fig. s1e). thus thr 198 phosphorylation 
promotes p27 stability.
consistent with thr 198 phosphorylation mediating accumulation 
of p27, yfp–p27t198a was less efficient at inhibiting colony formation 
in mcf-7 than yfp–p27 (fig. 2a). yfp–p27t198d was modestly more 
efficient than yfp–p27 (fig. 2a), consistent with high basal phospho-
rylation and stability of yfp–p27 in mcf-7 cells (fig. 1c). wild-type 
p27 and p27t198d also induced g1 arrest more efficiently than p27t198a 
(fig. 2b).  these  data  suggest  that  p-thr 198-dependent  stabiliza-
tion of p27 is required for optimal inhibition of colony formation and 
cell-cycle progression.
in a fraction of stable yfp–p27 expressing cells, yfp–p27 and p27t198d, 
but not yfp–p27t198a, were localized to cytosolic granular compartments 
surrounded by lysosomes (see supplementary information, fig. s2a). in 
addition, yfp–p27 and yfp–p27t198d transfected cells exhibited stronger 
monodansylcadaverine  (mdc)  staining  than  yfp–p27t198a  cells  (see 
supplementary information, fig. s2b). mdc is a selective marker for acidic 
cellular compartments, including lysosomes and autophagosomes, induced 
during autophagy19. furthermore, serum starvation (12 h) induced typical 
autophagocytic gfp–lc3 puncta in  u2os cells expressing gfp fused with 
the microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 (lc3), an autophago-
cytic vesicle marker20 (see supplementary information, fig. s2c). however, 
even in the presence of serum, expression of rfp–p27 or rfp–p27t198d 
increased cytoplasmic gfp–lc3 puncta to approximately 55–78% com-
pared with approximately 15% in rfp–p27t198a or control cells (fig. 2c). 
thus, expression of stable p27 was sufficient to induce autophagy.
both p27 thr 198 phosphorylation and p27 stability increased in 
serum-starved cells concurrent with induction of autophagy, consist-
ent with p27 functioning in serum deprivation induced autophagy (data 
not shown). a p27 small interfering rna (sirna) pool induced nearly 
complete knockdown of p27 protein without affecting cyclin d1, cdk4 
or p21 levels (see supplementary information, fig. s2d). in the pres-
ence of non-targeted sirna, serum-starved gfp–lc3 u2os cells con-
tained autophagic vesicles (see supplementary information, fig. s2e). 
in contrast, on p27 depletion, serum deprivation induced rapid cell

shrinkage and membrane blebbing followed by loss of cellular integ-
rity, indicative of apoptosis (see supplementary information, fig. s2e). 
in serum-starved mcf-7 cells, p27 sirna induced cleavage of poly-
adp–ribose polymerase (parp) and caspase-7 activation (fig. 3a). cell 
viability was also markedly reduced by p27 knockdown (fig. 3b).
to verify that cell death induced by p27 sirna was due to p27 knock-
down, the effects of sirna-resistant yfp–p27 (wt-r) and yfp–p27t198a 
(t198a-r) were assessed. transient transfection of wt-r but not t198a-
r before p27 sirna inhibited parp cleavage by approximately 40% rela-
tive to controls (fig. 3c), in parallel with transfection efficiency.
serum starvation, inhibition of pi(3)k by ly294002 or mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mtor) by rapamycin all induce autophagy21. 
under  each  condition,  p27  sirna  triggered  parp  and  caspase-7 
cleavage (fig. 3d). furthermore, both a sirna pool-1 and a single 
sirna-4 targeting distinct p27 sequences induced ly294002-treated 
mcf-7 cells to undergo cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and pro-
duction of apoptotic bodies (fig. 3e). parp and caspase-7 cleavage

(see  supplementary  information,  fig. s2f).  cell-cycle  blockade  in 
g2–m (~80%) or at the g1–s boundary (97%) by nocodazole and 
mimosine, respectively, did not rescue cells from apoptosis induced 
by p27 knockdown in the presence of rapamycin. instead, mimosine 
and nocodazole cooperated with rapamycin and p27 knockdown to 
increase cell death (see supplementary information, fig. s2g). thus, 
the effects of p27 depletion on apoptosis were not due to aberrant 
cell-cycle progression.

cell-cycle arrest in g1 and/or s phase may contribute to autophagy 
as mimosine, hydroxyurea and aphidocholine increased lc3 cleav-
age, whereas nocodazole had only modest effects (see supplementary 
information, fig. s2h). cells arrested in g2–m were resistant to rapamy-
cin-induced autophagy, consistent with previous studies22. this may rep-
resent a highly conserved mitotic or post-mitotic checkpoint control 
of autophagy23.
l e t t e r s
serum-starvation, ly294002- or rapamycin-induced apoptosis in p27-
depleted cells was due to disruption of intracellular energy balance, as 
methypyruvate, a growth factor-independent energy source4, markedly 
reduced parp and caspase-7 cleavage (see fig. 3d). furthermore, deple-
tion of glucose, together with p27 knockdown, augmented the induction 
of parp and caspase-7 cleavage compare with that observed for either 
treatment alone. glucose deprivation induced ampk t-loop phospho-
rylation (pampk), indicative of elevated amp:atp ratios, regardless of 
p27 knockdown (fig. 3f). thus, concurrent energy depletion and p27 
knockdown are required to induce apoptosis.
collectively, our data indicate that induction of autophagy by meta-
bolic stress requires inputs from p27 and thr 198 phosphorylation stabi-
lizes p27. therefore, we wanted to identify a kinase pathway activated in 
response to metabolic stress that could mediate thr 198 phosphorylation 
and subsequent p27 stabilization.
the energy-sensing lkb1–ampk pathway regulates cell survival under 
conditions of nutrient and energy-deprivation that increase amp:atp 
ratios24,25. lkb1 and p27 levels were positively correlated in breast and 
melanoma lines. mcf-7 cells with the highest lkb1 and p-thr 198 p27 
levels (see fig. 1c), exhibit p27 levels 5–10-fold higher than wm239 and 
wm35 melanoma cells where lkb1 protein and pampk were undetect-
able (fig. 4a). there was also a statistical correlation between lkb1 and 
p27 protein levels in primary human breast cancers (p <0.001; fig. 4b).
in  hela  cells,  which  lack  lkb1  (ref. 24),  basal  p27  protein  and 
thr 198 phosphorylation levels were low and unresponsive to glucose 
starvation. in contrast, glucose starvation led to a threefold increase 
in p27, p-thr 198 p27 and pacc (an ampk substrate) in hela cells 
transfected with lkb1 (fig. 4c).
aicar,  an  ampk  activator5,7,24,  induced  rapid  and  robust 
increases in p27 thr 198 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent man-
ner in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs; fig. 4d, e). at early time 
points (<2 h) or low concentrations of aicar (<1 mm), concurrent 
increases in p-thr 198 and p27 levels occurred. p-thr 198 p27 levels 
were sustained for >24 h following aicar addition, despite a mod-
est decline in p27 levels when aicar concentration exceeded 1 mm 
(fig. 4d, e). this may be due to suppression of protein synthesis, 
as high levels of aicar and ampk activation abrogate ribosomal 
protein s6 phosphorylation, indicative of inhibition of protein syn-
thesis. similarly, glucose starvation5 in 3t3l1 preadipocytes acutely 
increased p-thr 198 p27 (fig. 4f). aicar- and glucose deprivation-
induced p27 thr 198 phosphorylation correlated with increases in 
pampk and pacc indicative of ampk activation (fig. 4d, e and 
f). thus, p27 thr 198 phosphorylation seems to be regulated by the 
lkb1–ampk pathway.
sirna-mediated depletion of lkb1 reduced p27 thr 198 phospho-
rylation and p27 accumulation following glucose starvation, but had 
little effect on p27 under high glucose conditions, further implicating 
lkb1–ampk in p27 phosphorylation and stability (fig. 4g). however, 
as lkb1 knockdown did not alter basal p27 thr 198 phosphorylation, 
ampk  may  be  activated  through  lkb1-independent  mechanisms. 
alternatively, kinases outside the lkb1–ampk pathway contribute to 
basal p27 thr 198 phosphorylation.
the sequence preceding thr 198 includes a potential ampk phos-
phorylation motif5,26, as well as motifs for other kinases including 
pka, p90rsk, chk1 and akt (see supplementary information, 
fig. s3a). purified ampkα1 phosphorylated recombinant p27, which

was markedly increased by amp (see supplementary information, 
fig. s3b). t198a mutation resulted in an approximately 15% decrease 
in p27 phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating that although 
thr 198  may  represent  an  ampk  target,  ampk  phosphorylates 
additional  p27  sites  in  vitro.  ampkα1  modestly  phosphorylated 
wild-type  thr 198  peptide  but  not  t198a  mutant  peptide  in  an 
amp-dependent  manner,  as  indicated  by  32p  incorporation  (see 
supplementary information, fig. s3c) or anti-p-thr 198 blotting (see 
supplementary information, fig. s3d). the modest level of thr 198 
peptide phosphorylation and decrease in p27t198a phosphorylation in 
vitro, although compatible with ampk being a p27 thr 198 kinase, 
implicate additional kinases downstream of lkb1–ampk in thr 198 
phosphorylation in vivo.
although p27 can be phosphorylated at thr 198 by p90rsk and 
akt depending on cell context17,27, neither of these kinases are active 
in quiescent cells. instead, akt activation is essential for the uptake 
and utilization of extracellular nutrients9 and akt1/2 double-knockout 
cells demonstrate increased amp:atp ratios and subsequent ampk 
activation28. in mcf-7 cells, inhibition of pi(3)k markedly decreased 
akt phosphorylation but increased pampk and p27 protein levels (see 
supplementary information, fig. s3e), suggesting that akt did not con-
tribute to p27 stabilization.
to determine whether p90rsk and chk1 in the mapk or dna-
damage pathways contribute to p27 thr 198 phosphorylation, mefs 
were treated with either uv irradiation or the mek inhibitor uo126. 
compared with the striking effects of aicar, uv irradiation or inhibi-
tion of map activation did not significantly alter thr 198 phosphoryla-
tion (see supplementary information, fig. s3f, g).
our  data  suggest  that  the  lkb1–ampk  pathway  regulates  p27 
thr 198 phosphorylation during metabolic stress. to determine whether 
p27 is a critical mediator of lkb1–ampk controlled cell fate, ampk 
was activated in normal (p27+/+) and p27 knockout (p27–/–) mefs with 
aicar. aicar-induced apoptotic morphological changes and tunel 
positivity in p27–/– cells, but not in p27+/+ cells (fig. 5a). electron micro-
scopy was performed to determine whether the sensitivity of p27–/– cells 
to apoptosis correlated with autophagy. although autolysosomes (late 
stage autophagic vacuoles) were present at low levels in mefs (fig. 5b, 
a and aʹ), aicar markedly increased the number and size of autophagic 
vacuoles in p27+/+ mefs (fig. 5b, c and cʹ). in contrast, fewer autophagic 
vacuoles were present in p27–/– mefs with (fig. 5b, d and dʹ) or with-
out (fig. 5b, b and bʹ) aicar. at low concentrations of aicar, mem-
brane-bound structures resembling autophagosomes were present in 
p27–/– mefs (data not shown). thus, although not required for induction 
of autophagy, p27 determines the extent and consequence of autophagy. 
consistent with the role of p27 in regulating autophagy, glucose with-
drawal for 14 h induced autophagy in p27+/+ mef (fig. 5b, e and eʹ) but 
not in p27–/– cells (fig. 5b, f and fʹ, and c). together, these data suggest 
that p27 functions in the maintenance of autophagy and cell viability 
following ampk activation.
the p27–/– cells express low levels of a truncated p27 lacking the 
amino-terminal cyclin-binding domain29. therefore, the effects of p27 
on autophagy and cell survival may depend on its ability to inhibit cyc-
lin–cdks. on ampk activation, p-thr 198 p27 efficiently associated 
with cyclin d1–cdk4, despite a substantial reduction in cyclin d1 levels 
following aicar treatment (see supplementary information, fig. s4a, 
b). the relative amount of cdk4 bound to p-thr 198 p27 was greater

than that bound to total p27, whereas cdk2 was detectable in total p27 
immunoprecipitates but not in p-thr 198 p27 immunoprecipitates (see 
supplementary information, fig. s4b). thus p-thr 198 p27 seems to 
preferentially bind to cdk4. neither cyclin e nor cyclin a was detectable 
in either total p27 or p-thr 198 complexes (data not shown) under the 
culture conditions tested, despite being readily detected in total lysates 
(see supplementary information, fig. s4a).
we further assessed the role of cdk2 and cdk4 in the effects of p27 
depletion on autophagy and apoptosis (see supplementary information, 
fig. s4c–f). knockdown of either cdk2 or cdk4 alone induced a mod-
est increase in autophagy in the presence of serum and partially res-
cued the effects of p27 depletion and serum starvation on apoptosis, 
resulting  in  increased  autophagy  (see  supplementary  information, 
fig. s4c). although cdk2 knockdown led to increases in p27 levels (see 
supplementary information, fig. s4f), the ability of cdk2 sirna to 
induce autophagy was not due to increases in p27 because this effect was 
not abolished by simultaneous knockdown of p27 (see supplementary 
information, fig. s4c). these data suggest that cdk2 and cdk4 both 
222 
nature cell biology  volume 9 | number 2 | february 2007
contribute to the effects of p27 depletion. concurrent knockdown of 
both cdk2 and cdk4 increased gfp–lc3 puncta and lc3-ii 2–3-fold in 
a dose-dependent manner and suppressed apoptosis to a greater degree 
than either cdk sirna alone (see supplementary information, fig. s4c–
e). the effects of cdk4 and cdk2 silencing to reduce the apoptosis caused 
by p27 knockdown may reflect the reversal of aberrant cdk activation 
consequent to loss of p27. regardless, the effects of p27 on the decision 
to undergo autophagy or apoptosis seem to be dependent, at least in part, 
on the regulation of cdk activity.
our data indicate that during metabolic stress thr 198 phosphor-
ylation promotes p27 stability. p27 accumulation is a determinant of 
whether quiescent cells enter the autophagy cell survival pathway or 
undergo rapid cell death by apoptosis. thus, regulation of p27 links 
the nutrient-sensing pathway, autophagy, cell-cycle arrest and cell sur-
vival. this may contribute to a dual effect of p27 on tumorigenesis: 
decreased levels of p27 allow cell-cycle progression, whereas loss of 
p27 below a level sufficient to maintain autophagy results in death of 
tumour cells by apoptosis under the adverse conditions present dur-
ing tumorigenesis. these contentions are supported by the observa-
tions that during growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis p27 is 
degraded by caspases30 and that oncogene-mediated transformation and 
cancer progression are impaired in the absence of p27 in mouse breast 
and prostate cancer model systems31,32. mutational inactivation of the 
p27kip1 gene is a rare event in human cancers and homozygous deletions 
have not been reported.
the tumour microenvironment frequently has a decreased blood sup-
ply with reduced oxygen tension, ph and nutrient availability. various 
chemotherapy agents, signal transduction inhibitors and anti-angiogenic 
agents antagonize cellular metabolism and also increase p27 levels. thus, 
tumour cells may be dependent on p27 to sustain viability through 
autophagy during tumorigenesis, tumour progression and therapy.
methods
cell culture. breast cancer cells mda-mb468, mda-mb231, bt474, bt474-
m1, t47d and mcf-7 and melanoma cells wm35 and wm239 were cultured 
in rpmi1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 5% fbs. normal and 
p27–/– mefs obtained from andrew koff (sloan-kettering, new york, ny), 3t3l1 
and gfp–lc3 u2os cells generated by stable transfection of an expression vector 
encoding for the lc3–gfp fusion protein were maintained in dmem with high 
glucose supplemented with 5% fbs. where indicated, cells were treated with 
ly294002 (roche scientific, indianapolis, in), mg132 (sigma, st louis, mo), 
methylpyruvate (sigma), 5ʹ-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
ribonucleoside (aicar; toronto research chemicals inc., north york, canada), 
uo126 and rapamycin (cell signaling, beverly, ma) and the controls were treated 
with vehicle alone.
plasmids, site-directed mutagenesis and transfections. yfp–p27t198a and 
yfp–p27t198d were generated by replacing respective amino acid residues 
of yfp–p27 (ref. 33) with either alanine or aspartatic acid by site-directed 
mutagenesis using a quickchange mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, 
ca). rfp–p27, rfp–p27t198a and rfp–p27t198d were generated by cut-and-
paste of the p27 alleles from the above yfp constructs. the sirna-resistant 
yfp–p27 (wt-r) and the yfp–p27t198a mutant (t198a-r) constructs were 
generated by mutating three nucleotide base pairs to alternative nucleotides 
within the sirna target region without altering the amino acid sequences. 
the sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dna sequencing. the 
plasmid encoding gfp–lc3 vector was obtained from noboru mizushima 
(tokyo metropolitan institute of medical science, tokyo, japan), and lkb1 
from  hans  c.  clevers  (netherlands  cancer  institute,  amsterdam,  the 
netherlands). transfection was performed using fugene 6 (roche scientific) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and ensuing experiments were 
l e t t e r s
performed 48 h post-transfection unless otherwise specified. stable lines 
were established by g418 selection.
phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy. images  were  acquired  using  a 
nikon eclipse te200-e microscope and iplab imaging software (biovision 
technologies, exton, pa).
cell-viability assays were performed using a celltiter glo kit (promega, madison, 
wi). the data represent six independent experiments (mean ± s.d.).

antibodies. antibodies against parp, cyclin d1, pkb, phospho-pkb (ser 473), 
ampk  and  phospho-ampkα  (t172)  were  obtained  from  cell  signaling 
technology; against caspase-7 from bd pharmingen (san diego, ca); against p21 
(c19), p27 (c-19), cyclin e (m20), cdk4 (c-22), and cdk2 (m2) from santa cruz 
biotechnology (santa cruz, ca); against p27 from transduction laboratories; 
against lkb1 from abcam (cambridge, ma); and against α-tubulin, β-tubu-
lin and β-actin from sigma-aldrich. phospho-p27 (thr 198) antibody (301a) 
against kpglrrrqpt was obtained as a prerelease reagent from r&d system 
(minneapolis, mn).
immunoprecipitation and western blotting. cell lysis, immunoprecipitation and 
immunoblotting were performed as previously described34. immunoprecipitation 
and  immunoblotting  experiments  used  200  and  50 μg  of  protein  lysates, 
respectively, unless otherwise indicated. antibody alone controls were run along 
side all immunoprecipitates and equal protein loading of all western blots was 
verified by blotting for β-actin.
reverse-phase  protein  microarray  analysis.  tissue  lysate  microarray  was 
processed as previously described35. briefly, serially diluted lysates were spotted 
onto fast slides (schleicher & schuell biosciences, keene, nh) using a robotic 
genetac arrayer (genomic solutions, ann arbor, mi). after printing, the slides 
were blotted sequentially with re-blot (chemicon, temecula, ca), i-block and 
a biotin blocking system (dako, carpinteria, ca), probed with primary anti-
bodies and incubated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies. the signals 
were then amplified using a catalysed signal amplification kit (dakocytomation, 
carpinteria, ca) according to manufacture’s instructions. the processed slides 
were scanned and quantitated using the microvigene software (vigenetech inc., 
north billerica, ma) and the quantitative values of five consistently expressed 
proteins (p38, jnk, erk, mtor and gsk) as internal controls.
two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino-acid 
analysis. mcf-7 cells transfected with yfp–p27 or yfp–p27t198a were incubated 
in phosphate-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fbs for 4 h before meta-
bolic labelling with 1 mci 32p-orthophosphate (amersham pharmacia biotech, 
piscataway, nj) per p100 dish for 3 h at 37 °c. cells were lysed in an ice-cold 
nonidet p40 lysis buffer. cell lysates were then pre-cleared with normal rab-
bit igg before immunoprecipitation of yfp–p27. the immunoprecipitates were 
resolved by 12% sds–page, transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane and 
autoradiographed. yfp–p27 bands dissected from the membrane were blocked 
with 0.5% polyvinyl difluride in 100 μm tris at ph 7.6 at 37 °c for 30 min and 
digested overnight with 10 μg of modified trypsin (roche diagnostics). the sam-
ples were then lyophilized and treated with ice-cold performic acid (45 μl formic

acid and 5 μl h2o2 ; 37%). lyophilized samples were resuspended in 5 μl ph 1.9 
buffer (formic acid 2.5%; glacial acetic acid 7.8% in aqueous solution) and loaded 
onto cellulose thin layer plates. thin layer electrophoresis (tle) was performed 
with ph 1.9 buffer at 1000 v for 60 min using hunter thin-layer electrophoresis 
system (htle-7000; cbs scientific, del mar, ca) system. ascending thin layer 
chromatography (tlc) was performed using a phosphochromatography buffer 
(n-butano 37.5%, pyridine 25%, glacial acetic acid 7.5% in aqueous solution) for 
24 h. the plates were then air dried and subject to autoradiography.
