trehalose, a disaccharide present in many non-mammalian
species, protects cells against various environmental stresses.
whereas some of the protective effects may be explained by its
chemical chaperone properties, its actions are largely unknown.
here we report a novel function of trehalose as an mtor-inde-
pendent autophagy activator. trehalose-induced autophagy
enhanced the clearance of autophagy substrates like mutant
huntingtin and the a30p and a53t mutants of ␣-synuclein,
associated with huntington disease (hd) and parkinson disease
(pd), respectively. furthermore, trehalose and mtor inhibi-
tion by rapamycin together exerted an additive effect on the
clearance of
these aggregate-prone proteins because of
increased autophagic activity. by inducing autophagy, we
showed that trehalose also protects cells against subsequent
pro-apoptotic insults via the mitochondrial pathway. the dual
protective properties of trehalose (as an inducer of autophagy
and chemical chaperone) and the combinatorial strategy with
rapamycin may be relevant to the treatment of hd and related
diseases, where the mutant proteins are autophagy substrates.
trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide found in many or-
ganisms, including bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates,
and plants. it is the natural hemolymph sugar of invertebrates.
it functions to protect the integrity of cells against various envi-
ronmental stresses like heat, cold, desiccation, dehydration,
and oxidation by preventing protein denaturation (1). many of
the stress-protecting properties of trehalose were discovered in
yeast (2); however, it also has beneficial effects in mammals
where it is not endogenously synthesized. for instance, it may
be a valuable tool for cryopreservation of cells (1, 3). it is not

clear how trehalose mediates many of its protective effects, but
some may be via its ability to act as chemical chaperone and
influence protein folding through direct protein-trehalose
interactions (4). trehalose inhibits amyloid formation of insu-
lin in vitro (5) and prevents aggregation of ␤-amyloid associated
with alzheimer disease (6). recently, trehalose was shown to
inhibit polyglutamine (polyq)3-mediated protein aggregation
in vitro, reduce mutant huntingtin aggregates and toxicity in
cell models and alleviate polyq-induced pathology in the r6/2
mouse model of huntington disease (hd) (7). this protective
effect was suggested to be caused by trehalose binding to
expanded polyq and stabilizing the partially unfolded mutant
protein.
hd is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder
caused by a cag trinucleotide repeat expansion, which results
in an abnormally long polyq tract in the n terminus of the
huntingtin protein. asymptomatic individuals have 35 or fewer
cag repeats, whereas hd is caused by 36 or more repeats. hd
and related polyq expansion diseases are associated with the
formation of intraneuronal inclusions (also known as aggre-
gates) by the mutant proteins containing the expanded polyq
tracts. the toxicity of mutant huntingtin is thought to be
exposed after it is cleaved to form n-terminal fragments con-
sisting of the first 100–150 residues containing the expanded
polyq tract, which are also the toxic species found in aggre-
gates. thus, hd pathogenesis is frequently modeled with exon
1 fragments containing expanded polyq repeats, which cause
aggregate formation and toxicity in cell models and in vivo (8).
the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins like mutant hun-
tingtin fragments, other polyq mutations, mutant ␣-synucleins
and tau is strongly dependent on macroautophagy, generally
referred to as autophagy (9–13). autophagy is a process that
allows bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents. it involves the
formation of double membrane structures called autophago-
somes, which fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes

trehalose induces autophagy
where their contents are degraded (14). induction of autophagy
reduces the levels of mutant huntingtin and protects against its
toxicity in cells and in transgenic drosophila and mouse models
of hd (10, 11, 13). the apparent clearance of huntingtin aggre-
gates by autophagy is likely to be a consequence of removal of
aggregate precursors (soluble and oligomeric species), rather
than big inclusions, which do not appear to be membrane-
bound and are also much larger than typical autophagosomes.
currently, the only suitable pharmacological strategy for
upregulating autophagy in mammalian brains is to use rapamy-
cin, or its analogues, that inhibit the mammalian target of rapa-
mycin (mtor), a negative regulator of autophagy (14).
parkinson disease (pd) is another condition associated with
aggregate formation. the intraneuronal lewy body aggregates
seen in pd have the protein ␣-synuclein as a major component.
the a53t and a30p point mutations in ␣-synuclein cause
autosomal dominant forms of pd (15, 16). the a53t and a30p
␣-synuclein mutants are substrates of autophagy, and the clear-
ance of these mutant forms is retarded when autophagy is
inhibited (12). while these forms of ␣-synuclein aggregate in
vivo, we do not observe overt aggregation in our cell lines (12).
furthermore, unlike wild-type ␣-synuclein,
these mutant
forms are not cleared by the chaperone-mediated autophagy
pathway (17), which is distinct from macroautophagy (which
we call autophagy in this report). hence, we have used these
mutations as model autophagy substrates.
here we identify a novel role for trehalose as an autophagy
inducer. trehalose, in aqueous solutions, leads to enhanced
clearance of aggregate-prone proteins like mutant huntingtin
and ␣-synuclein, and protects cells from subsequent pro-apo-
ptotic insults.
experimental procedures
plasmid constructs—hd gene exon 1 fragment with 74
polyq repeats in pegfp-c1 (clontech) (egfp-hdq74) and
ha-hdq74 constructs were characterized previously (18).
egfp-lc3, myc-lc3-ha (from t. yoshimori), egfp-atg5
(from n. mizushima), and egfp-bax (from r. youle) con-
structs were obtained as kind gifts. pabpn1 a17 (from e.
wahle) was subcloned into phm6 (roche applied science) to
generate the ha-pabpn1 a17 construct.
reagents—compounds used were 100 mm d-(⫹)-trehalose
dihydrate, 100 mm sucrose, 100 mm d-(⫹)-raffinose pentahy-
drate, 100 mm d-sorbitol, 0.2 ␮m rapamycin, 200 nm bafilomy-
cin a1, 10 mm 3-methyladenine, 10 ␮m lactacystin, 3 ␮m stau-
rosporine, 200 ␮g/ml congo red (all from sigma-aldrich), and
100 mm d-(⫹)-glucose (bdh).
mammalian cell culture and transfection—african green
monkey kidney cells (cos-7), human neuroblastoma cells (sk-
n-sh), human cervical carcinoma cells (hela), stable hela
cells expressing egfp-lc3 (19) (kind gift from a. m. tolk-
ovsky), and wild-type atg5 (atg5⫹/⫹) and atg5-deficient
(atg5⫺/⫺) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (20) (mefs) (kind gift
from n. mizushima) were maintained in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine
(sigma) at 37 °c, 5% co2.
inducible pc12 stable cell lines expressing egfp-hdq74 or
egfp-hdq23 (10, 21), and ha-tagged a30p or a53t
␣-synuclein mutants (12), previously characterized, were main-
tained at 75 ␮g/ml hygromycin b (calbiochem) in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm
l-glutamine, and 100 ␮g/ml g418 (invitrogen) at 37 °c, 10%
co2.
t-rex 293 (invitrogen), derived from human embryonal kid-
ney cell line hek 293, was maintained in dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5
␮g/ml blasticidin s (invitrogen) at 37 °c, 5% co2. qa1/12/9a
and a21/12/2b (tre) are stable transfectant cell lines produced
from t-rex 293, which were maintained in similar medium
and conditions as t-rex 293 along with the addition of 500
␮g/ml g418 (geneticin) and 250 ␮g/ml zeocin (invitrogen).
cells were transfected with the constructs for 4 h using lipo-
fectamine or lipofectamine 2000 reagent (invitrogen) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol, fixed with 4% paraformal-
dehyde (sigma) after 48 h (egfp-hdq74) or 2 h (egfp-lc3)
post-transfection, and mounted in citifluor (citifluor ltd.)
containing 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi; 3 ␮g/ml;
sigma-aldrich).
quantification of aggregate formation and cell death—ap-
proximately 200 egfp-positive cells were counted for the pro-
portion of cells with egfp-hdq74 aggregates, as described
previously. only egfp-positive cells were counted so that we
count only the transfected cells. if an egfp-positive cell has one
or many aggregates, the aggregate score is one. if an egfp-
positive cell does not have any aggregate, the aggregate score is
zero. nuclei were stained with dapi and those showing apo-
ptotic morphology were considered abnormal. these criteria
are specific for cell death, which highly correlate with pro-
pidium iodide staining in live cells (22). similar assessment for
cell death was done after apoptotic insults with staurosporine
or bax. experiments were done in triplicate at least twice.
quantification of cells with egfp-lc3 vesicles—similar
analyses in triplicate were done for counting the proportion of
egfp-positive cells with egfp-lc3 vesicles. approximately
100 egfp-positive cells were counted for the proportions of
egfp-positive cells with ⬎5 lc3-positive vesicles. we consid-
ered an egfp-positive cell as having a score of zero if there were
5 or fewer vesicles (as cells have basal levels of autophagy) and
cells scored one if they had ⬎5 lc3-positive vesicles (13).
clearance of mutant huntingtin and ␣-synucleins—stable
inducible pc12 cell lines expressing egfp-hdq74, egfp-
hdq23, or ␣-synuclein mutants (a30p or a53t) were induced
with 1 ␮g/ml doxycycline (sigma) for 8 and 48 h, respectively
(10, 12). transgene expression was switched off by removing
doxycycline from medium. cells were treated with or without
compounds for time points as indicated in experiments. com-
pounds were replenished every 24 h for egfp-hdq74 clear-
ance. clearance of soluble huntingtin or ␣-synuclein mutants
was measured by immunoblotting with antibody against egfp
or ha, respectively.
western blot analysis—cell pellets were lysed on ice in
laemmli buffer (62.5 mm tris-hcl, ph 6.8, 5% ␤-mercapto-

ethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 30
min in presence of protease inhibitors (roche applied sci-
ence). primary antibodies include anti-egfp (8362-1, clon-
tech), anti-ha (12ca5, covance), anti-complex iv subunit
iv (a-21348, molecular probes), anti-cytochrome c (4272),
anti-caspase 3 (9665), anti-mtor (2972), anti-phospho-
mtor (ser2448) (2971), anti-p70 s6 kinase (9202), anti-
phospho-p70 s6 kinase (thr389) (9206), anti-4e-bp1 (9452),
anti-phospho-4e-bp1 (thr37/46) (9459) (all from cell signal-
ing technology), anti-lc3 (kind gift from t. yoshimori),
anti-beclin-1 (3738, cell signaling), anti-atg7 (600-401-487,
rockland), anti-atg12 (36-6400, zymed laboratories), anti-
c-myc (c3956, sigma), anti-actin (a2066, sigma), and
anti-tubulin (clone dm 1a, sigma). blots were probed with
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit igg-horseradish peroxidase and
visualized using ecl or ecl plus detection kit (amersham
biosciences).
generation of stable human cell line synthesizing intracel-
lular trehalose—t-rex 293 (invitrogen), derived from the
human embryonal kidney cell line hek 293, expresses tetr,
which represses transcription from promoters containing
the tet operator unless tetracycline or derivatives are present
in the medium. qa1/12/9a and a21/12/2b (tre) are stable
transfectant cell lines produced from t-rex 293, which con-
tains a tetracycline-inducible form of the trehalose-6-phos-
phate synthase gene (otsa ) ofescherichia coli, together with
constitutively expressed otsb (trehalose-6-phosphate phospha-
tase gene). intracellular trehalose concentration in qa1/12/9a
(tre) cell line, 24 h after tetracycline induction, is ⬃20 mm as
determined by gas chromatography (23).
immunocytochemistry—cells were fixed with 4% paraform-
aldehyde in 0.1 m pbs, ph 7.6, immunolabeled with antibody
against active caspase 3 (g7481, promega) or ha (12ca5,
covance) and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody
(alexa fluor 488 (green) goat anti-rabbit or alexa fluor 594
(red) goat anti-mouse (molecular probes, cambridge bio-
science), respectively), and mounted in citifluor containing
dapi (3 ␮g/ml; sigma-aldrich) to visualize nuclei. approxi-
mately 200 cells were scored for abnormal apoptotic nuclei (cell
death) and active caspase 3 (bright, fluorescent immunolabel-
ing using the active caspase 3 antibody).
microscopy—transfected cells were analyzed on a nikon
eclipse e600 fluorescence microscope (plan-apo 60⫻/1.4 oil
immersion lens at room temperature) (nikon, inc.). images of
egfp-lc3 hela stable or cos-7 cells were acquired on a zeiss
lsm510 meta confocal microscope (63 ⫻ 1.4 na plan-apoc-
hromat oil immersion or fluar 40⫻/1.3 oil lens, respectively) at
room temperature using zeiss lsm510 v3.2 software (carl
zeiss, inc.), and adobe photoshop 6.0 (adobe systems, inc.)
was used for subsequent image processing.
statistical analysis—aggregate formation, cell death, or
egfp-lc3 vesicles were expressed as percentages from tripli-
cate samples, and the error bars denote s.e. p values were deter-
mined by unconditional logistical regression analysis, using the
general log-linear analysis option of spss 9 software (spss,
chicago). densitometry analysis on the immunoblots was done
by scion image beta 4.02 software (scion corporation) from
three independent experiments (n ⫽ 3). significance for the

results
trehalose reduces polyq-mediated aggregation and cell
the clearance of soluble mutant
death and enhances
huntingtin—we confirmed that trehalose reduced aggregation
and cell death caused by egfp-tagged huntingtin exon 1 with
74 polyq repeats (egfp-hdq74) in cos-7 (non-neuronal)
and sk-n-sh (neuronal precursor) cells (fig. 1, a and b and
supplemental fig. s1a). this effect of 100 mm trehalose was not
caused by osmotic stress and was not a general property of the
disaccharides, as no such effect was seen with 100 mm sucrose
(a disaccharide), raffinose (a trisaccharide), or sorbitol (a sugar
alcohol) (fig. 1, a and b).
we tested if the reduced aggregation of the huntingtin con-
struct was partly because of enhanced clearance leading to
lower levels (10, 18), using a stable doxycycline-inducible pc12
cell line expressing egfp-hdq74, where transgene expression
is first induced by adding doxycycline and then switched off by
removing doxycycline from the medium. if the transgene
expression level is followed at various times after switching off
expression after an initial induction period, one can assess if
specific agents alter the clearance of the transgene product, as
the amount of transgene product decays when synthesis is
stopped (10). trehalose significantly reduced egfp-hdq74
aggregates at 48 and 72 h and enhanced the clearance of soluble
egfp-hdq74 and insoluble mutant huntingtin (that gets
retarded in the stacking gel) at 120 h (fig. 1, c and d and sup-
plemental fig. s1b). sucrose, raffinose, and sorbitol did not
have any effects on the clearance of egfp-hdq74 when used at
similar concentrations (fig. 1e). the enhanced clearance of
egfp-hdq74 is not simply a chaperone effect, as no clearance
was observed with congo red at doses that do reduce egfp-
hdq74 aggregation and toxicity (supplemental fig. s1, c and
d). however, trehalose did not influence the clearance of wild-
type huntingtin exon 1 (egfp-hdq23) (fig. 1f and supple-
mental fig. s1e).
trehalose enhances the clearance of ␣-synuclein mutants—
we also assessed the clearance of a53t and a30p ␣-synuclein
mutants using stable doxycycline-inducible pc12 cell lines,
using similar switch-on/off paradigms to egfp-hdq74, as
these are autophagy substrates (12). trehalose significantly
enhanced the clearance of a30p and a53t mutants of
␣-synuclein at 24h (fig. 2, a and b). however, it had no signif-
icant effect on the clearance of wild-type ␣-synuclein at 24 h
(fig. 2c). this is entirely consistent with previous observations
that wild-type ␣-synuclein clearance is not obviously retarded
when autophagy is blocked, in contrast to the mutants (12, 17).
trehalose reduces mutant huntingtin aggregates by auto-
phagic route—we tested if the enhanced clearance of mutant
huntingtin mediated by trehalose was by autophagy or the pro-
teasomal route, using inhibitors of autophagy (3-methyl ade-
nine, 3-ma) and the proteasome (lactacystin). both these

autophagy was inhibited by 3-ma,
trehalose could not further reduce
egfp-hdq74 aggregates (fig. 3a

ever, cells treated with the protea-
some inhibitor lactacystin and tre-
halose had significantly reduced
egfp-hdq74 aggregates,
com-
pared with cells treated with lacta-
cystin alone (fig. 3a and supple-

used together with lactacystin, the

sions were significantly increased

deficiency dramatically increased mutant huntingtin aggrega-
tion and toxicity compared with untreated atg5⫹/⫹ cells, as
this mutant protein is an autophagy substrate (fig. 3, b and c).
when these cells were treated with trehalose, the mutant hun-
tingtin aggregation and toxicity were significantly reduced in
atg5⫹/⫹ cells, but not in atg5/autophagy-deficient (atg5⫺/⫺)
cells, thus confirming that the ability of trehalose to induce
autophagy is a major factor behind its ability to reduce mutant
huntingtin aggregation in cells (fig. 3, b and c).
trehalose induces autophagy—we first assessed the effect of
trehalose on autophagy in the atg5⫹/⫹ and atg5⫺/⫺ mefs by
measuring the levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (lc3). endogenous lc3 is processed post-translation-
ally into lc3-i, which is cytosolic. lc3-i is converted to lc3-ii,
which associates with autophagosome membranes (24). lc3-ii
levels relative to actin/tubulin correlate with autophagosome
number per cell (24, 25). as we are interested in autophago-
some number per cell, we have not quantified lc3-ii versus
lc3-i, as some lc3-ii can be converted back to lc3-i (26).
trehalose significantly increased lc3-ii levels in the autoph-
agy-competent atg5⫹/⫹ cells, but not in the autophagy-defi-
cient atg5⫺/⫺ cells (fig. 3d).
lc3-ii levels were significantly increased also in cos-7 cells
treated with trehalose for 24 h (fig. 4a). hela cells stably
expressing lc3 fused to egfp (egfp-lc3) (19) treated for 24 h
with trehalose had significantly higher egfp-lc3-ii levels (fig.
4b) compared with untreated cells. the increase in lc3-ii by
trehalose is similar to what has been observed previously when
autophagy is induced (24). in this cell line, 100 mm trehalose
(the concentration used in our experiments) induced autoph-
agy (supplemental fig. s3a).
accumulation of lc3-ii can occur because of increased
autophagosome formation, but also if there is impaired auto-
phagosome-lysosome fusion. we assayed lc3-ii in the pres-
ence of bafilomycin a1, which blocks autophagosome-lyso-
some fusion (27). bafilomycin a1 resulted in the expected
increase in egfp-lc3-ii in stable hela cells (fig. 4c). the
dose of bafilomycin a1 used is saturating for lc3-ii levels in
this assay (data not shown). further blockage of autophago-
some-lysosome fusion via a bafilomycin a1-independent
mechanism, using the dynein inhibitor erythro-9-[3-(2-hy-
droxynonyl)]adenine (ehna) (28), along with this dose of
bafilomycin a1, results in no increase in lc3-ii compared
with bafilomycin a1 alone (data not shown). however, tre-
halose significantly increased egfp-lc3-ii levels in pres-
ence of bafilomycin a1, compared with bafilomycin a1
alone, strongly arguing that the increased autophagosomes
induced by trehalose are upstream of autophagosome-lyso-

some fusion, at the level of autophagosome formation (fig.
4c). this result was confirmed in neuronally differentiated
non-mitotic pc12 stable cells by analyzing endogenous
lc3-ii (fig. 4d).
we next assessed the effect of trehalose on autophagy by
transfecting cos-7 cells with egfp-lc3, which localizes
only to autophagic membranes but not on other membrane
structures (24). as egfp-lc3 overexpression does not affect
autophagic activity, numbers of egfp-lc3 vesicles have fre-
quently been used to assess autophagic activity. assessment
of autophagosome number with lc3 is both more sensitive
and specific than electron microscopy (25). a significantly
greater proportion of trehalose-treated cells expressing
egfp-lc3 had overt vesicle formation compared with
untreated cells (fig. 4e and supplemental fig. s3b). rapamy-
cin, an inducer of autophagy, also increased the proportion
of cells containing egfp-lc3 vesicles (fig. 4e). trehalose
also increased lc3 vesicle numbers in stable egfp-lc3
hela cells (fig. 4f).
stable human cell lines synthesizing intracellular trehalose
have increased autophagy—to test whether intracellular
trehalose has the same effect as trehalose in the medium, we
used a human cell line engineered to produce trehalose
endogenously. the cell line, qa1/12/9a (tre), was derived
from the human kidney cell line, t-rex 293, and carries
inducible trehalose synthase genes. in induced qa1/12/9a
(tre) cells containing ⬃20 mm trehalose, we saw increases in
egfp-lc3 vesicles compared with the control cell
line
(t-rex 293), suggesting that trehalose enhances autophagy
by acting on intracellular targets (fig. 5, a and b). similarly,
increased autophagy was seen in another clonal cell line
a21/12/2b (tre) synthesizing intracellular trehalose, com-
pared with t-rex 293 cells (fig. 5c).
in uninduced qa1/12/9a (tre) cells, trehalose is present
at ⬃1 mm (probably due to leaky expression of otsa). even
this low intracellular trehalose concentration increased
lc3-ii levels, compared with uninduced t-rex 293 cells
(fig. 5d). the qa1/12/9a (tre) cells have significantly more

trehalose protects against subsequent pro-apoptotic insults—
we recently described that autophagy induction by rapamycin
leads to protection against subsequent pro-apoptotic insults
acting via the mitochondrial cell death pathway. we provided a
plausible mechanism for the protective effect exerted by rapa-
mycin. we observed decreased levels of several mitochondrial
proteins after rapamycin pretreatment, suggesting enhanced
clearance of mitochondria, which are degraded via autophagy
(14). after pro-apoptotic insults, we observed decreased levels
of cytosolic cytochrome c and activated caspases in cells pre-
treated with rapamycin, consistent with reduced mitochondrial
load. we proposed that the protective effect of rapamycin can
be accounted for by enhanced clearance of mitochondria by
autophagy, thereby reducing cytosolic cytochrome c release
and downstream caspase activation after pro-apoptotic insults
(29).
accordingly, we tested whether trehalose had similar protec-
tive effects. trehalose reduced the levels of mitochondrial com-
plex iv and cytochrome c in these cells, like rapamycin (fig. 6, a
and b). these proteins accumulate when autophagy is inhibited
(29). neither intracellular (30) nor extracellular (fig. 6c) treha-
lose cause enhanced cell death in the cell types and paradigms
we studied. trehalose protected against subsequent toxicity of
bax, a pro-apoptotic protein that acts on mitochondria, against
staurosporine toxicity and lowered levels of cleaved (active)
caspase 3 (fig. 6, d–g). no benefit was observed with short
term incubation (fig. 6, e and g), consistent with a model
requiring prolonged autophagy to reduce mitochondrial load.
these effects correlated with induction of lc3-ii levels by long
term trehalose treatment (fig. 6h).
to test if these effects were dependent on autophagy, we
tested if trehalose incubation protected against subsequent
pro-apoptotic insults in autophagy-incompetent atg5-defi-
cient mefs (20). no protective effects of trehalose against stau-
rosporine-induced cell death were seen in the atg5-deficient
cells, while protective effects were seen in wild-type mefs, or if
atg5 was transfected into the atg5-deficient cells (fig. 6, i and
j). thus, enhancing autophagy with trehalose protects against
subsequent pro-apoptotic insults.
trehalose-induced autophagy is mtor-independent—we
next studied whether induction of autophagy by trehalose was
dependent on the known pathway that is negatively regulated
by mtor in mammalian cells. mtor kinase activity can be
inferred by the levels of phosphorylation of its substrates, ribo-
somal s6 protein kinase (s6k1, also known as p70s6k) and
eukaryotic initiation factor 4e-binding protein 1 (4e-bp1) at
thr389 and thr37/46, respectively, and the phosphorylation of
ribosomal s6 protein (s6p) at ser235/236, a substrate of p70s6k
(31). while rapamycin (a specific mtor inhibitor) reduced
phosphorylation of p70s6k, s6p and 4e-bp1, trehalose had no

have additive effects in reducing
egfp-hdq74 aggregates and cell
death in cos-7 cells, compared
with the single treatments of treha-
lose or rapamycin (fig. 8, a and b).
furthermore, trehalose and rapa-
mycin together significantly facili-
tated greater clearance of aggre-
gated and soluble egfp-hdq74
at 72 h and a30p ␣-synuclein at
16 h, compared with single either
compound alone (fig. 8, c and d).
here we chose early time points
when we do not see dramatic reduc-
tions of the levels of these proteins
when the cells are treated with
either of the compounds alone. we
have used saturating doses of rapa-
mycin (0.2 ␮m) (13) and trehalose
(supplemental fig. s3e). cos-7
cells treated with both trehalose and
rapamycin significantly had more
egfp-positive
containing
egfp-lc3 vesicles than either of
the compounds treated alone (fig.
8e). thus autophagic activity can be
further enhanced through simulta-
neous
induction of an mtor-
dependent and -independent route,
compared with each of the route
induced individually.

other neuronal cells are not known
to express trehalase (33), we further
confirmed that our trehalose effects

ination by showing that combined
glucose and trehalose treatment (at
saturating doses) (32) (fig. s3e)
resulted in far more egfp-hdq74

compound alone (fig. 8f). hek-
293 cells, from which the t-rex
293 cells and stable inducible tre-
halose cells were generated, do not
metabolize intracellular trehalose (30), consistent with sug-
gestions that hek-293 cells are derived from a rare neuronal
cells present in the hek primary culture.
such effects (fig. 7, a–d and supplemental fig. s3d), suggest-
ing that trehalose does not inhibit mtor. likewise, mtor
activity was not affected in a stable cell line expressing intracel-
lular trehalose (fig. 7, e–g).

trehalose induces autophagy
the differences that we observed with the longer expan-
sions that cause polyq disease (⬎37 repeats) versus the short
(17 alanine) expansion causing opmd are likely to be caused
by the following factors. as expected for a nuclear protein,
pabpn1 clearance is mediated by the proteasome, and auto-
phagy has minimal influence (35). autophagy can only act on
extranuclear proteins and the significant cytosolic localiza-
tion of huntingtin explains why it is efficiently cleared by
autophagy. indeed, iwata et al. (36) reported that the clear-
ance of polyq expanded ataxin-1, which is largely nuclear,
showed no obvious dependence on autophagy, while a major
dependence on autophagy seen with the identical construct
where the nuclear localization signal was mutated. consist-
ent with this paradigm, mutant huntingtin clearance is still
enhanced by inducing autophagy with trehalose (or other
autophagy-inducing agents like lithium or inositol mono-
phosphatase inhibitor (13)) in cells treated with the protea-
some inhibitor, lactacystin (fig. 3a and supplemental fig.
s2a). however, mutant pabpn1 clearance induced by tre-
halose is blocked by this proteasome inhibitor (35).
we have further confirmed these data by comparing
mutant huntingtin and mutant pabpn1 aggregation in
autophagy-competent
-incompetent
(atg5⫺/⫺) mefs. in untreated atg5⫺/⫺ cells, mutant hun-
tingtin aggregation was significantly increased as compared
with atg5⫹/⫹ cells; however, no significant effect on mutant
pabpn1 aggregation was observed (fig. 3b and supplemen-
tal fig. s4a). when these cells were treated with trehalose,
the pabpn1 aggregation was significantly reduced even in
atg5⫺/⫺ cells (suggesting that trehalose acts independently
of autophagy for pabpn1), while no significant reduction of
huntingtin aggregation was seen in atg5⫺/⫺ cells (confirm-
ing that the autophagy-inducing ability of trehalose is a
major factor behind its effect in reducing mutant huntingtin
aggregation in cells) (fig. 3b and supplemental fig. s4a).
trehalose appears to induce autophagy efficiently in cells
containing either mutant huntingtin or mutant pabpn1
(supplemental fig. s4, b–d).
(atg5⫹/⫹)
and
the ability of trehalose to attenuate poly(a) aggregation but
not polyq aggregation in cells treated with inhibitors of their
clearance may be due to the different structures (37, 38) and
detergent resistance of these aggregates. polyq, but not
poly(a), aggregates formed in cells are resistant to 4% sds and
4% triton (39).
enhanced autophagy occurred in cells that synthesize intra-
cellular trehalose at ⬃20 mm (fig. 5, a–c and supplemental fig.
s3c), and even in uninduced qa1/12/9a (tre) cells where tre-
halose is present at ⬃1 mm (probably because of basal levels of
otsa expression) compared with uninduced t-rex 293 cells
(fig. 5d). although 100 mm extracellular trehalose had autoph-
agy-inducing effects similar to endogenous trehalose, no
increases in lc3-ii were seen at extracellular concentrations of
10 mm or lower (supplemental fig. s3a). thus, it is likely that
the trehalose is acting intracellularly, and not because of secre-
tion of intracellular trehalose.
trehalose does not readily cross cell membranes, but can be
efficiently loaded into mammalian cells via fluid-phase endocy-
tosis and pinocytosis (3, 40) like other small molecules that do
figure 7. induction of autophagy by trehalose is mtor-independent.
a–d, cos-7 cells treated with or without 100 mm tre or 0.2 ␮m rap for 24 h,
were analyzed for mtor activity by immunoblotting for levels of phospho-
and total mtor (a), p70s6k (b), s6p (c), and 4e-bp1 (d). e–g, t-rex 293 (con-
trol) and qa1/12/9a (tre) cell lines induced as in fig. 5b for 24 h were analyzed
for mtor activity by immunoblotting for levels of phospho- and total mtor
(e), p70s6k (f), s6p (g).
aggregate-prone proteins, and also protection against certain
subsequent pro-apoptotic insults.
trehalose reduced polyq-mediated aggregation and toxicity
caused by mutant huntingtin fragments (fig. 1, a–c and sup-
plemental fig. s1a). although this protective effect was previ-
ously thought to be caused by trehalose binding to expanded
polyq and stabilizing the partially unfolded mutant protein (7),
here we show that a major consequence of trehalose is to induce
autophagy thereby enhancing clearance of the mutant protein
(figs. 1d, 4,a–f, 5,b–d, and supplemental fig. s3, a–c),
because the ability of trehalose to reduce mutant huntingtin
aggregates was abolished when autophagy was inhibited (fig. 3,
a–d and supplemental fig. s2a).
trehalose may have different effects on different aggre-
gate-prone proteins. we recently described that trehalose
protected against the toxicity of the polyalanine (poly(a))-
expanded form of the polyadenine-binding protein nuclear 1
(pabpn1) that causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy
(opmd) (35). unlike mutant huntingtin, which forms both
nuclear and cytosolic aggregates and is largely intracytosolic
when soluble, mutant pabpn1 is essentially entirely
intranuclear at steady state (8, 35). trehalose enhanced
proteasome-dependent clearance of mutant pabpn1 (35),
in contrast with the current data which shows for the first
time that trehalose induces autophagy, which is responsible
for the enhanced clearance of autophagy substrates like
mutant huntingtin and ␣-synuclein. also mutant huntingtin
aggregation was not reduced by trehalose in cells treated
with the autophagy inhibitor 3-ma (fig. 3a and supplemen-
tal fig. s2a), while mutant pabpn1 aggregation was
reduced by the sugar even when protein clearance pathways
were blocked (35).

not readily cross membranes (41). extracellular trehalose is
likely acting in the cytosol in the same compartment(s) as the
trehalose in the stable cells. there are many precedents for cells
taking up extracellular material that does not readily cross cell
membranes by pinocytosis or endocytosis and then releasing it
into the cytosol, including mhc class ii antigen presentation
(42), and dna transfection methods (43, 44). thus, it is entirely
plausible that high concentrations of extracellular trehalose can
act via effects in the same cytosolic compartments as plasmid-
synthesized trehalose, outside of membrane-bound pinosomes
or endosomes.
the failure of trehalose to accelerate the clearance of wild-
type ␣-synuclein and egfp-hdq23 (figs. 1f and 2c and sup-
plemental fig. s1e) is entirely consistent with previous data
suggesting that the dependence of proteins on the macroauto-
phagy pathway for their clearance correlates with their propen-
sity to aggregate (10, 12). the non-aggregate prone wild-type
proteins are efficiently cleared by the proteasomes. for proteins
that are accessible to both pathways, the greater efficiency of
the ubiquitin-proteasome system compared with basal levels of
macroautophagy makes the proteasomes the favored and dom-
inating clearance route. when a cytosolic protein is aggregate-

prone and a poor proteasome substrate, then macroautophagy
becomes a major clearance route by default. under these cir-
cumstances, the macroautophagy route becomes more effec-
tive than the proteasome.
our data suggesting that trehalose acts independently of
mtor (fig. 7, a–g and supplemental fig. s3d) may be
explained by two possibilities. the two pathways may be truly
independent and may act even on different components of the
autophagy machinery. alternatively, trehalose may act on a
component in the pathway between mtor and autophagy.
unfortunately, this is impossible to test without knowing what
these components are, and they are currently not characterized
in the context of mammalian autophagy. trehalose is not sim-
ply increasing the levels of autophagy regulators like beclin-1/
atg6, atg12, atg7, or atg5 (supplemental fig. s5, a–d). the
new role of trehalose as an autophagy inducer could have con-
tributed to its protective effect in hd mice (7) because mutant
huntingtin is an autophagy substrate and upregulating autoph-
agy reduces the levels of mutant huntingtin and protects against
its toxicity in cells, transgenic drosophila, and mouse models of
hd (10, 11).
trehalose may also protect against secondary apoptotic
effects (fig. 6, a–j) occuring in hd in an autophagy-dependent
manner. furthermore, the ability of trehalose to protect against
diverse pro-apoptotic insults in an autophagy-dependent man-
ner may account for some of its previously poorly understood
beneficial properties in a diversity of contexts (1). as far as we
are aware, these anti-apoptotic effects of trehalose have not
been reported previously. they also add to our previous data
showing that rapamycin-induced autophagy is protective
against subsequent pro-apoptotic insults and argue that auto-
phagy induced by either mtor-dependent or mtor-inde-
pendent pathways may be beneficial in this context.
it is difficult to be certain that prolonged up-regulation of
autophagy would be without risks. one theoretical concern is
that enhanced mitochondrial turnover might be deleterious.
increasing autophagy decreases the mitochondrial load to a
lower steady-state level but will not result in eventual total
depletion of mitochondria (29, 45). very large decreases in
mitochondrial load may be associated with deleterious effects
due to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation. however, it
should be noted that although such relationships are complex
and tissue-dependent, the activities of some respiratory com-
plexes can be reduced by 25–80% before respiration or atp
synthesis in brain mitochondria are affected, and the activity of
rat liver complex iii can be decreased by 45% before respiration
is affected (46). thus, it is likely to be possible to induce auto-
phagy and reduce mitochondrial load to levels that have sub-
stantial protective effects against proteinopathies but do not
affect respiration. it is also worth noting that rapamycin is used
chronically in people, and we are not aware of side effects that
are caused by autophagy. also, rapamycin attenuates mutant
huntingtin toxicity in hd fly and mouse models (11).
our data also raise the possibility of combination therapy
using trehalose and rapamycin, which may be more effective in
such diseases (fig. 8, a–e). this new role of trehalose coupled
with its anti-aggregation property and lack of toxicity increases
its efficacy for treating a spectrum of protein conformational
trehalose induces autophagy
disorders like hd and pd. recent data suggest that autophagy
induction may be effective in certain infectious diseases,
because mycobacteria and group a streptococci are cleared by
this process (34, 47, 48). therefore, it would be interesting to
test the efficacy of trehalose as a possible safe addition to the
armoury for treating such disorders.
