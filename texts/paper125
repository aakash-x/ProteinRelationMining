induces
indirubin, an isomer of indigo, is a reported inhibitor of
cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (gsk-3) as well as an agonist of the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (ahr). indirubin is the active
ingredient of a traditional chinese medicinal recipe used
against chronic myelocytic leukemia. numerous indirubin
analogs have been synthesized to optimize this promising
kinase inhibitor scaffold. we report here on the cellular
effects of 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (7bio). in contrast
to its 5-bromo- and 6-bromo- isomers, and to indirubin-30-
oxime, 7bio has only a marginal
inhibitory activity
towards cdks and gsk-3. unexpectedly, 7bio triggers
from apoptosis.
a rapid cell death process distinct
7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
the
appearance
of large pycnotic nuclei, without classical features of
apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and nuclear
fragmentation. 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime-induced cell
death is not accompanied by cytochrome c release
neither by any measurable effector caspase activation.
furthermore, the death process is not altered either by
the presence of q-vd-oph, a broad-spectrum caspase
inhibitor, or the overexpression of bcl-2 and bcl-xl
proteins. neither ahr nor p53 is required during 7bio-
induced cell death. thus,
to previously
described indirubins, 7bio triggers the activation of
non-apoptotic cell death, possibly through necroptosis or
autophagy. although their molecular targets remain to be
identiﬁed, 7-substituted indirubins may constitute a new
class of potential antitumor compounds that would retain
their activity in cells refractory to apoptosis.

cellular
introduction
in man, 518þ protein kinases and 80þ protein
phosphatases control the phosphorylation of enzymes
and structural proteins. phosphorylation/dephosphory-
lation constitutes one of the most common yet complex
post-translational
regulatory mechanism.
abnormal phosphorylation on speciﬁc proteins
is
observed in essentially all pathologies and this has
stimulated an extraordinary interest in small molecular
weight inhibitors of kinases and phosphatases. protein
kinases now constitute the second class of targets (after
g-protein-coupled receptors) used in the drug screening
efforts of
in
cohen, 2002; fischer, 2004; weinmann and metternich,
2005). these efforts have received considerable support
from the remarkable success story of gleevec, one
of the ﬁrst commercial kinase inhibitors. currently,
55 kinase inhibitors are under clinical evaluation
against diseases such as cancers, inﬂammation, diabetes,
neurodegeneration, etc.
the pharmaceutical
industry (reviews
cyclin-dependent kinases
(cdks) play essential
functions all along the cell cycle and there are multiple
examples of dysfunctions of cdks and their regulators
in cancer (vermeulen et al., 2003). furthermore, cdks
are involved in various neurodegenerative diseases such
as alzheimer’s, parkinson’s and nieman-pick’s diseases,
ischemia and traumatic brain injury. a few academic
groups, and most pharmaceutical companies, have thus
invested in the search for pharmacological inhibitors
of cdks (reviews in knockaert et al., 2002; fischer
et al., 2003; benson et al., 2005; fischer and gianella-
borradori, 2005). optimization of such inhibitors has
been efﬁciently assisted by their co-crystallization with
cdk2 (noble et al., 2004), cdk5 (mapelli et al., 2005)
and cdk6 (lu et al., 2005).
the bis-indole alkaloid indirubin and its analogs
(collectively referred to as indirubins) were among some
of the early cdk inhibitors to be discovered (hoessel
et al., 1999). the red/purple indirubin is an isomer of the
blue indigo. both are derived from the spontaneous,
non-enzymatic dimerization of isatin and indoxyl, two
precursors found either free or conjugated to carbohy-
drates in natural sources. indirubins can indeed be
extracted from various indigo dye-producing plants
(200þ species) (balfour-paul, 1998). they are also
present in the historic ‘tyrean purple’ dye extracted
from various muricidae mollusks (15þ species) (meijer
et al., 2003; review in cooksey, 2001). they are also
extracted from various wild-type and recombinant
bacteria (guengerich et al., 2004; wu et al., 2005 and
references therein). finally,
indirubin and indigo are
occasionally present in human urine (adachi et al., 2001
and references therein). interestingly, indirubin is the
active ingredient of a traditional chinese medicine
recipe, danggui longhui wan, used to treat various
diseases including chronic myelocytic leukemia (review
in xiao et al., 2002). besides cdks, indirubins were
found to target glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk-3)
(leclerc et al., 2001), glycogen phosphorylase b (kos-
mopoulou et al., 2004) and the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (ahr), also known as the dioxin receptor
(adachi et al., 2001; kawanishi et al., 2003). aryl
hydrocarbon receptor mediates the effects of many
xenobiotics such as dioxin and indole-containing com-
pounds (review in denison and nagy, 2003). upon
binding to xenobiotic-responsive element, activated
ahr induces the transcription of numerous genes,
including cytochrome p450 cyp1a1, p27kip1, myristoyl-
transferase, etc. (review in elferink, 2003). evidence
suggests that the antiproliferative effects of indirubins
derive from their ability to inhibit cdks (damiens
et al., 2001; marko et al., 2001). however, interaction
induction of p27kip1
with ahr and the subsequent
contributes to a marked arrest
in g1 (knockaert
et al., 2004). finally it has been recently shown that
some indirubins prevent
the phosphorylation and
subsequent activation of the transcription factor signal
transducers and activators of transcription (stat3),
leading to a downregulation of survival factors such as
antitumor activity of 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
j ribas et al
survivin and mcl-1, and subsequent induction of cell
death (nam et al., 2005).

insigniﬁcant
in this article, we report on a new subfamily of
indirubins, substituted on position 7. unexpectedly,
despite weak or
activity
on various classical kinase targets of
indirubins,
7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime potently induces a rapid cell
death distinct from classical apoptosis. the possible
mechanisms of action of 7-substituted indirubins and
their potential as antitumor agents will be discussed.
inhibitory
results
(io)
different bromoindirubins display different selectivities
for kinases
in a previous study, we observed that a bromine
substitution of indirubins on position 6 led to com-
pounds with increased selectivity towards gsk-3
(meijer et al., 2003; polychronopoulos et al., 2004).
we further extended this work by synthesizing and
comparing indirubin-30-oxime
and 5-bromo-
(5bio), 6-bromo-(6bio) or 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
(7bio) (table 1). surprisingly, compared to io, 5bio
and 6bio, 7bio displayed very weak inhibitory activity
towards our routine screening kinase targets, gsk-3,
cdk1/cyclin b, cdk5/p25. replacement of the bro-
mine substituent by chlorine (7-chloroindirubin-30-
iodine (7-iodoindirubin-30-oxime

the 7-
halogeno-indirubin-30oximes, whereas substitution with
ﬂuorine (7-ﬂuoroindirubin-30-oxime (7fio)) enhanced
the kinase inhibitory potency (table 1). finally,
substitution of 7bio on n1 with a methyl group

(1-methyl-7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (me7bio)) led to
a completely inactive compound, as observed previously
with me6bio (meijer et al., 2003).
we next investigated the selectivity of io, 5bio, 6bio
and 7bio in the 85 kinase proqinase selectivity panel
(table 2) (in contrast to the above-mentioned kinase
assays performed at a ﬁnal 15 mm atp concentration,
the proqinase assays are run in the absence of cold
atp. as indirubins act by competing with atp binding,
the ic50 values are dependent on the assay atp
concentration, therefore the values of tables 1 and 2
cannot be compared directly). this approach ﬁrst
revealed that aurora a-c, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
(flt3), ret constitute new targets of io, 5bio and
6bio. vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(vegf-r) had been previously described as a target
for indirubins (jautelat et al., 2005). the selectivity
panel also revealed that, compared to the three other
indirubins, 7bio is a poor kinase inhibitor. only one
kinase, flt3, was inhibited by 7bio with an ic50 below
1 mm (table 2) (15 kinases for io, 11 for 5bio, 19 for
6bio). 7-br-, 7cl- and 7i-substituted indirubin-30-
oximes showed a signiﬁcant inhibitory activity towards
aurora c, a modest activity on aurora b and little
activity, if any, on aurora a (data not shown), whereas
7fio appeared to be equipotent on the three aurora
forms. unexpectedly, me7bio was found to be rather
active on aurora c, but completely inactive on aurora
a and b (data not shown). fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
was found to be sensitive to all eight indirubins tested
including me7bio. the effects of indirubins on aurora
kinases and flt3 will be reported in detail elsewhere.
induction of cell death by indirubins
we next compared the four indirubins for their ability
to induce cell death in neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells

occasionally observed under conditions different from
cell death, we used an independent cell death assay, the
lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release assay (figure 1b).
dose–response curves showed that 7bio is the most
potent compound in terms of concentration required to
reduce cell survival (mts reduction) (figure 1a) or to
induce cell death (ldh release) (figure 1b). however,
7bio’s efﬁcacy was sensitive to the concentration of
serum, suggesting that it binds to serum proteins (data
not shown). different halogens were introduced in
position 7 of indirubin-30-oxime (figure 2, table 1).
7-fluoroindirubin-30-oxime was poorly
active on
cells compared to the equipotent 7bio and 7cio.
7-iodoindirubin-30-oxime was the most potent com-
pound (figure 2a). these results did not correlate with
those obtained in the in vitro kinase assays (table 1).

abolished the cell death-inducing ability of 7bio
(figure 2b). as 7bio was a poor inhibitor of kinases
and yet a potent cell death inducer, we decided to
investigate the effects of this compound in more detail.
to ascertain that the induction of cell death by 7bio
was not a speciﬁc property of sh-sy5y cells, we also
used the breast cancer cell line mda-mb-231 (figure 3).
a 48-h exposure to 7bio induced a dose-dependent
inhibition of cell proliferation as evidenced by direct
counting. this effect was poorly if at all reversible by
removal of 7bio (figure 3a). we next analysed the
effects of 7bio on cell cycle distribution (figure 3b).
a tendency towards accumulation in g2/m and reduc-
tion of g0/g1 was observed, as described previously for
other indirubins (hoessel et al., 1999; damiens et al.,
2001; marko et al., 2001).
induction of cell death by 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime does
not require aryl hydrocarbon receptor
indirubins interact with ahr (adachi et al., 2001). this
interaction may contribute to the cellular effects of
indirubins (knockaert et al., 2004). however, sh-sy5y

figure 3 effects of 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (7bio) on cell
proliferation and cell cycle distribution in mda-mb-231 cells.
(a) cells were exposed at time 0 to various concentrations of 7bio
and cell numbers were determined at various times. at 48 h, the
culture medium was replaced by fresh medium devoid of 7bio.
(b) cells were exposed to various concentrations of 7bio for 24 h
and their distribution in the various cell cycle phases was
determined by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter analysis.
cells seem to be devoid of ahr (unpublished data). to
evaluate the contribution of ahr to the cell death
effects of 7bio, we made use of two hepatoma cell lines,
5l (ahr þ /þ ) and its ahr-deﬁcient subclone, bp8
(ahr  / ) (weiss et al., 1996; kolluri et al., 1999;
knockaert et al., 2004). we ﬁrst conﬁrmed that, like
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd)
(dioxin),
both 7bio and me7bio potently enhance the ahr-
dependent expression of the cdk inhibitory protein
p27kip1 (figure 4a), as reported previously for io and
6bio and their methylated counterparts, 1-methyl-
indirubin-30-oxime (meio) and me6bio (knockaert
et al., 2004). no correlation is thus observed between
induction of p27kip1 expression (figure 4a) and induc-
tion of cell death (figure 2b). we next analysed the
effects of 7bio and me7bio on cell cycle distribution of
ahr /  and ahr þ /þ cells. as reported for other
indirubins, both 7bio and me7bio induced a striking
ahr-dependent accumulation in g0/g1 (figure 4b).
finally, cell death induction was estimated in both cell
lines following exposure to increased 7bio concentra-
tions. the dose–response curves were essentially the
same (figure 4c). altogether these results show that
ahr is not involved in the cell death inducing properties
of 7bio.

7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime-induced cell death involves
neither p53 nor p21cip1 nor stat3 dephosphorylation
we next investigated the involvement of p53 and p21cip1
in cell death induced by the four indirubins (figure 5).
p53 was strongly induced by 5bio in a time-dependent
manner in sh-sy5y cells (figure 5a and b). induction
of p53 was only modest in cells treated with 6bio and

expression occurred with some delay after p53 stabilization (figure 5b). indirubin-30 -oxime, 5bio and 6bio
were roughly equipotent at inducing p21cip1overexpression, whereas 7bio and me7bio had negligible effects
(figure 5a). finally, we tested the effects of 7bio on
wild-type hct-116 and a hct-116 subclone deprived
of p53 (figure 5e). the dose–response curves were
essentially the same. altogether, these data suggest that
7bio-induced cell death does not induce p53 nor require
its contribution.
tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation
of the transcription factor stat3 were recently shown
to be inhibited by some indirubins, leading to the
downregulation of survival factors and subsequent
induction of cell death (nam et al., 2005). to examine
whether this mechanism is involved in the action of
7bio, we investigated the effect from io, 5bio, 6bio
and 7bio on the level of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated
stat3 in mda-mb-231 cells (figure 6). as a positive
control, cells were also stimulated by interferon a
(ifna). results show that the basal level of tyrosine

low compared to the level reached by stimulation with
ifna, yet it is downregulated by io, 5bio and 6bio
but not by 7bio. this suggests that the mechanism of
action of 7bio is not primarily due to an inactivation of
tyrosine-phosphorylated stat3.
induction of cell death by 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
is much faster than by other indirubins
a time course of sh-sy5y cell death induction was
next performed following exposure to 25 mm io, 5bio,
6bio, 7bio or me7bio (figure 7). although 5bio and
6bio required 36–48 h to induce 70% cell death, this
level was reached by 12 h with 7bio. almost complete
cell death was obtained with 7bio within 24 h (figure 7).
this much faster kinetics suggests that a different
mechanism of cell death is occurring in the case of
7bio compared to the other indirubins. alternatively, a
subpopulation of cells may respond to 5bio and 6bio
as they do to 7bio, whereas the vast majority undergoes
apoptosis.
7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime induces non-apoptotic cell
death
to investigate the mechanism of action of 7bio, we ﬁrst
examined, under a ﬂuorescence microscope, sh-sy5y
cells exposed to different indirubins following bisbenzi-
mide and propidium iodide (pi) staining (figure 8).
first of all, no pi staining was observed in control cells
and in me7bio-treated cells
(figure 8a and f),
conﬁrming the absence of cell death. indirubin-30-oxime,
5bio and 6bio all triggered nuclear fragmentation
typical of apoptosis, accompanied by secondary necrosis
(figure 8b–d). these ﬁgures were never observed in
7bio-treated cells that, in contrast, displayed numerous

large, unfragmented pycnotic nuclei (figure 8e). such
ﬁgures were observed only occasionally with 5bio and
6bio (figure 8c and d). these morphological results
suggest
that 7bio triggers an atypical cell death
different from apoptosis.
to challenge this possibility, the activity of caspases
was assayed in sh-sy5y cells exposed to various con-
centrations of different indirubins (figure 9). 5-bromo-
indirubin-30-oxime and 6bio and io to a lesser extent,
triggered a dose- (figure 9a) and time- (figure 9b)
dependent activation of caspase. in sharp contrast,
neither 7bio nor me7bio induced any activation of
caspases, which remained at
the level of control,
untreated cells. furthermore, q-vd-oph, a general
caspase inhibitor (caserta et al., 2003), had no effect on
cell death induced by 7bio (figure 10), whereas it
reduced the level of cell death induced by 5bio and
6bio, and io, to a lesser extent (figure 10a). the time
course of 7bio-induced cell death was unaffected by
q-vd-oph (figure 10b).
moreover, 7bio triggered negligible release of cyto-
chrome c from mitochondria (figure 11). under the
same conditions io, 5bio and 6bio induced the release
of cytochrome c to levels similar to those reached by
standard apoptosis-inducing reagents like staurosporine
(sts) and etoposide. we next examined dna laddering
as a reﬂection of apoptotic cell death. the laddering
caused by r-roscovitine was consistent with the
reported ability of this compound to induce apoptosis
(ribas and boix, 2004). 5-bromoindirubin-30-oxime and
to a lesser extent 6bio, also induced internuclesosomal
fragmentation, whose intensity was proportional to the
amount of apoptotic cells in the culture (see bisbenzi-
mide/pi staining in figure 8). in 7bio-treated cells, no
ladder was observed; however, most cells were dead. in
me7bio, io and dimethylsulfoxide (dmso)
treat-
ments, cell death induction was negligible and no
laddering was detected.
altogether these results show that 7bio-induced cell
death does not induce cytochrome c release and does not
trigger nor require the activation of caspases, in sharp
contrast with cell death induced by io, 5bio and 6bio.
thus 7bio appears to induce a cell death pathway
which differs from the apoptosis induced by io, 5bio
and 6bio.
7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime-induced cell death is not
inhibited by cellular mechanisms able to protect cells from
apoptosis
to further explore the cell death process triggered
by 7bio, we wondered whether proved mechanisms
of resistance to apoptosis were able to protect cells
from 7bio’s effects. sh-sy5y cells can be differen-
tiated in cell culture by retinoic acid (ra) and this
differentiation prevents apoptosis triggered by cdk
inhibitors like olomoucine or roscovitine (ribas and
boix, 2004). similarly, differentiation renders sh-sy5y
cells
shown in figure 12,
differentiation had negligible effect on the rates of
7bio-induced cell death.

together, these results reinforce the action of 7bio

non-apoptotic, caspase-independent cell death is a general
characteristic of the death processes triggered by

tumors derived cell lines, jurkat and hl-60. as shown
in figure 13 (left column), 7bio induced cell death in
the same range of concentrations characterized as lethal
for sh-sy5y, mda-mb-231 (breast cancer) and
hct116 (colon cancer) cell types. the sensitivity of

triggered by 7bio in imr-5, imr-32, jurkat and hl60 cells. bisbenzimide staining, ﬂuorescence and electron
microcopy characterizations demonstrated that nonapoptotic cell death was taking place as described in shsy5y cells (data not shown). in addition, effector
caspase activation was assessed at 24 h (figure 13,
right). as expected, 5bio triggered caspase activation.
compared with sts, 5bio displayed reduced caspase
activation, consistent with (1) the mixed type of cell
death that 5bio induces and (2) less synchronous
kinetics of apoptosis induction. in contrast, devdase
activity in 7bio-treated cells fell consistently below the
background displayed by control, untreated cells. in

(me7bio), 0.25 mm staurosporine or 12.5 mm etoposide for 10 h.
cells were then harvested and fractionated into a nuclear pellet and
a cytoplasmic supernatant. the latter was resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by
western blotting using an anticytochrome c antibody. the
antibody crossreacts with an irrelevant protein used as an internal
loading marker. (b) sh-sy5y cells were treated with dimethylsulfoxide (0.25%), 25 mm io, 5bio, 6bio, 7bio or me7bio, or 25 mm

1.5% agarose gels.
conclusion, the non-apoptotic, caspase-independent
type of cell death triggered by 7bio appears to be an
intrinsic property of the compound, independent of the
cell model.

discussion
indirubins have been the object of many chemical
modulations in order to improve their selectivity proﬁle,
kinase inhibitory efﬁcacy and solubility. in particular,
numerous modiﬁcations have been carried out on
positions 30 , 50 , 60 on one indole ring and 5 or 6 on the
other indole ring (hoessel et al., 1999; leclerc et al.,
2001; meijer et al., 2003; merz et al., 2004; polychronopoulos et al., 2004; jautelat et al., 2005). however, no
modiﬁcations have ever been reported on position 7.
one reason might be that substitution at this position
almost annihilates inhibitory activity towards key
targets of indirubins, cdks and gsk-3. the fast and
potent induction of cell death by 7bio was totally
unexpected, but provided the impetus to investigate
7-substituted indirubins further. indirubins have been
co-crystallized with cdk2 (hoessel et al., 1999),
cdk2/cyclin a (davies et al., 2001), cdk5 (mapelli
et al., 2005), pfpk5, the plasmodium falciparum homolog of cdk1 (holton et al., 2003), gsk-3b (bertrand

figure 13 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime (7bio) induces caspase-
independent cell death in four additional cell lines. imr-5, imr-
32, hl-60 and jurkat cells were challenged with increasing
concentrations of 7bio for 24 h and cell viability was determined
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-
(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium procedure (left). every point is the
mean7s.e. of three independent experiments with six independent
measurements per experiment. the same cell lines were subjected
for 24 h to treatments with staurosporine (1 mm), 5-bromoindir-
ubin-30-oxime (25 mm), 7bio (25 mm) or left untreated (u) and the
activation of effector caspases (devdase activity in arbitrary
ﬂuorescent units) was measured (right). bar value is the mean7s.e.
of six independent determinations.
et al., 2004). these co-crystal structures suggest that a
bromine substitution on position 7 would be detrimental
to the interaction of indirubins with their targets as will
be described in detail elsewhere (in preparation). a
general steric hindrance by the bromine is supported by
the fact that io substituted with a small atom such as
ﬂuorine is much more active toward kinases than when
the position 7 is
substituted with other halogens
(table 1). this overall unfavorable position 7 substitu-
tion is conﬁrmed by the kinase selectivity panel (table 2),
which shows that, compared to io, 5bio and 6bio,
7bio interacts poorly with protein kinases. however, this
panel only represents 85 out of 518 kinases and the
possibility that 7bio potently inhibits one or several
unidentiﬁed kinases remains open. in addition, 7bio
may bind to its targets in an orientation which is widely
different from that of io and 6bio in cdks and gsk-3.
oncogene
indirubins appear to induce different forms of cell
death according to their substitutions. we reported
previously that a transient exposure to io triggered a
necrotic type cell death in nocodazole-synchronized
hbl100 cells (damiens et al., 2001). in contrast, io
apparently triggered apoptotic type cell death in mcf-7
cells (marko et al., 2001). various 5-substituted indirubins
also induce apoptosis as evidenced by poly-(adp-ribose)
polymerase cleavage (nam et al., 2005). this apoptosis
appears to be correlated with downregulation of survival
factors such as survivin and mcl-1. induction of apoptosis
has also been recently described for 5-nitro-indirubin-30-
oxime (lee et al., 2005).
six arguments demonstrate that 7bio induces cell
death by a mechanism distinct from apoptosis: (1) a
morphological study of dying cells shows that 7bio
induces the appearance of large pycnotic nuclei, without
classical features of apoptosis such as nuclear fragmen-
tation and secondary necrosis (figure 8); (2) 7bio does
not trigger an activation of caspases (figures 9 and 13);
(3) the general caspase inhibitor q-vd-oph does not
counteract 7bio-induced cell death (figure 10); (4)
7bio does not induce cytochrome c release (figure 11);
(5) 7bio does not induce dna fragmentation (fig-
ure 11); (6) neither bcl-2 nor bc-xl overexpression
signiﬁcantly reduce the level of 7bio-induced cell death
(figure 12b).
what
inhibited by a family of
is the nature of 7bio-induced cell death?
besides apoptosis, a number of caspase-independent
cell death mechanisms have been described (reviews in
jaattela, 2004; broker et al, 2005). one such pathway is
autophagy, a cellular process involved both in cell
survival and in cell death which requires the family of
atg genes (review in baehecke, 2005). whether such a
pathway is involved in 7bio-induced cell death is
currently under investigation. recently, a new caspase-
independent cell death process, necroptosis, was de-
scribed that displays some of the characteristics of
necrosis and activation of autophagy (degterev et al.,
2005). we are currently investigating this pathway as a
potential mechanism of action of 7bio. interestingly, it
is
substituted indoles
called necrostatins (degterev et al., 2005). substituents
(methyl, halogen) at position 7 on necrostatin result in
increased inhibitory activity (teng et al., 2005). given
their partial structure similarity,
is tempting to
speculate that necrostatins and 7bio might share a
target which they affect in opposite directions. another
description of caspase-independent cell death implies the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) (chipuk
and green, 2005). although preliminary experiments
suggest that 7bio does not induce the generation of
ros in vitro (unpublished), we are still exploring this
possible mechanism of action of 7bio. electron
microscopy examination of 7bio-treated cells reveals
that 7bio induces a prominent disruption of endoplas-
mic reticulum without markedly affecting the nucleus
(data not shown), suggesting that 7bio acts as a potent
reticulum stress inducer.
it
indirubins interact with and activate ahr leading to
the upregulation of cytochrome p450 and p27kip1
in ahr /  and ahr þ /þ cells;
(adachi et al., 2001; spink et al., 2003; knockaert et al.,
2004; sugihara et al., 2004). 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
clearly activates ahr as observed in an in vitro
luciferase reporter system (unpublished), and conﬁrmed
by the ahr-dependent expression of p27kip1 and g1
arrest (figure 4). however, three pieces of evidence
suggest that ahr is not involved in the cell death
process induced by 7bio: (1) 7bio triggers cell death
equally well
(2)
neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells express very little if any
ahr (unpublished); (3) me7bio, which is as potent as
7bio in activating ahr, does not induce cell death.
7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime inhibits aurora c and
flt-3 (table 2 and unpublished data). yet me7bio,
which is as potent as 7bio at inhibiting both kinases,
does not trigger cell death (figure 2b). 7-bromoindir-
ubin-30-oxime-induced cell death is therefore unlikely to
be a direct consequence of inhibition of these two
kinases. we also believe that 7bio action does not
involve the downregulation of stat3 tyrosine phos-
phorylation and its subsequent inactivation as has been
suggested for other indirubins (nam et al., 2005)
(figure 11).
although it is too early to speculate on the potential
clinical use of 7-substituted indirubins, this new family
of indirubins opens a promising research area. firstly,
these molecules seem to interact with much less kinases
than previously described indirubins and thus appear
to be more selective (table 2). identiﬁcation of the
molecular targets of 7bio and 7-substituted indirubins
obviously constitutes a high priority. we plan to tackle
this using afﬁnity chromatography on immobilized
7bio as described for other kinase inhibitors (bach
et al., 2006). secondly, numerous cancer cells are
characterized by the development of various mechan-
isms of resistance to apoptosis (for instance over-
expression of
and bcl-xl oncogenic
proteins). such tumor cells thus constitute putative
targets for 7-substituted indirubins such as 7bio, which
induce cell death through a non-apoptotic pathway and
in a bcl2/bcl-xl-insensitive way. such indirubins might
thus allow the killing of
to
conventional anticancer drugs.

graphy using either gsh-agarose (sigma) or ni-nth-agarose
(qiagen, courtabeuf, france). the purity and identity of each
kinase was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (sds–page)/coomassie staining and by
western blot analysis. a proprietary protein kinase assay (33
panqinases activity assay) was used to assay the recombi-
nant enzymes. all kinase assays were performed in 96-well
flash platest from perkin elmer/nen (boston, ma, usa) in
a 50 ml reaction volume using a beckmancoulter/sagian

ml rnase a and 0.1% triton x-100. flow cytometry readings
were obtained by an epicss xl2 unit from coulter (beck-
man, ca, usa). data were processed by means of winmdi
(a free software from joe trotter)
in order to obtain
monoparametric dna histograms. finally, these histograms
were analysed with the multi-cycle software.

antitumor activity of 7-bromoindirubin-30-oxime
j ribas et al
caspase assay the measurement of caspase activity is based
on determining the ﬂuorescence released from the acdev-
dafc synthetic substrate after its direct addition to the culture
medium, detergent lysis, and incubation at 371c. this method
is devised to be applied to 96-multiwell plates. it allows kinetic
determinations of caspase activation and the characterization
of multiple drugs simultaneously (ribas et al., 2005).
electrophoresis and western blotting whole-cell extracts were
obtained in buffer containing 100 mm tris/hcl ph. 6.8, 1 mm
edta, 2% sds. following heat denaturation for 3 min,
proteins were separated by 10% sds–page (0.7 mm thick
gels) (p27kip1) or by 10% nupage precast bis-tris poly-
acrylamide mini gel electrophoresis system (invitrogen) with
mops sds (p53, p21cip1, actin) or mes sds (cytochrome c)
running buffer depending on protein size. proteins were
transferred to 0.45 mm nitrocellulose ﬁlters (schleicher and
schuell). these were blocked with 5% low-fat milk in tris-
buffered saline–tween-20, incubated for 1 h with antibodies
(anti-p27kip1: 1:1000; anti-actin: 1:1000; anti-bcl-2, 1:2000;
anti-bcl-xl, 1:5000; anti-tubulin, 1:4000; anti-stat3: 1:1000)
or overnight at 41c (anti-p53: 1:1000; p21cip1: 1:1000;
cytochrome c: 1:1000; anti-actin: 1:5000 (stat3 experiment);
anti-phosphotyr705-stat3: 1:1000) and analysed by en-
hanced chemiluminescence (amersham).
to study expression of p53 and p21cip1, cells were lysed for
30 min at 41c in radioimmunoprecipition assay buffer (150 mm
nacl, 1% np40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sds and 50 mm
tris-hcl ph 8.0) supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (roche). after centrifugation (12 000 g for 10 min), the
protein concentration was determined in the supernatants by
the bradford protein assay (bio-rad, marnes-la-coquette,
france). to study cytochrome c release from mitochondria, a
0.05% digitonin cytosolic extraction was performed (ribas
and boix, 2004).
in the stat3 study, cells were lysed in 30 mm hepes (ph
7.5), 10 mm nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, 25 mm naf, 1 mm egta,
1% triton x-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate,
6.4 mg/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate and protease inhibitor
cocktail (roche). total proteins (73 mg) was resolved on 10%
nupage with mops sds running buffer.

cell death and cell viability assessments cell death character-
ization based on nuclear morphology was assessed by double
staining with 0.05 mg/ml bisbenzimide and 25 mg/ml pi.
cell viability was determined by means of the mts method.
both procedures have been previously described in detail
(ribas and boix, 2004). for evaluation of dna laddering,
cell dna was extracted and electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose
gels to evidence the internucleosomal fragmentation typical
of apoptosis.
