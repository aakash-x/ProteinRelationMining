autophagy is a major catabolic pathway by which eukar-
yotic cells degrade and recycle macromolecules and orga-
nelles. this pathway is activated under environmental
stress conditions, during development and in various
pathological situations. in this study, we describe the
role of reactive oxygen species (ros) as signaling mole-
cules in starvation-induced autophagy. we show that
starvation stimulates formation of ros, speciﬁcally h2o2.
these oxidative conditions are essential for autophagy, as
treatment with antioxidative agents abolished the forma-
tion of autophagosomes and the consequent degradation
of proteins. furthermore, we identify the cysteine protease
hsatg4 as a direct target for oxidation by h2o2, and specify
a cysteine residue located near the hsatg4 catalytic site as
a critical for this regulation. expression of this regulatory
mutant prevented the formation of autophagosomes in
cells, thus providing a molecular mechanism for redox
regulation of the autophagic process.

introduction
autophagy is a major pathway for delivery of proteins and
organelles
to lysosomes/the vacuole, where they are
degraded and recycled. autophagy plays an essential role in
differentiation and development, as well as in cellular
response to stress. it is activated during amino-acid depriva-
tion and has been associated with neurodegenerative dis-
eases, cancer, pathogen infections and myopathies (reviewed
in cuervo, 2004; shintani and klionsky, 2004). autophagy is
initiated by the surrounding of cytoplasmic constituents by
the crescent-shaped isolation membrane/phagophore, which
forms a closed double-membrane structure, called autopha-
gosome. finally, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome
to become an autolysosome, and its content is degraded by
lysosomal hydrolases.

the molecular mechanism underlying autophagy has been
extensively researched in the past decade, and the genes
participating in this process, denoted atgs (autophagy-
related; klionsky et al, 2003), were found to be conserved
from yeast to man (ohsumi, 2001; huang and klionsky,
2002). yet, the roles played by the different gene products
and their modes of action are to be resolved. a hallmark
event in the autophagic process is the reversible conjugation
of the atg8 family of proteins to the autophagosomal mem-
brane (ichimura et al, 2000). this ubiquitin-like (ubl) pro-
tein family, which has been implicated in a variety of cellular
processes, includes atg8p in yeast (lang et al, 1998; ichimura
et al, 2000) and gate-16 (golgi-associated atpase enhancer
of 16 kda; sagiv et al, 2000), lc3 (light-chain 3; mann and
hammarback, 1994) and gabarap (gaba receptor-
associated protein; wang et al, 1999) in mammals. all atg8
homologues (hereafter termed atg8s) serve as substrates for
the atg4 family of cysteine proteases (kirisako et al, 2000;
hemelaar et al, 2003; marino et al, 2003; scherz-shouval
et al, 2003). atg4s cleave atg8s near the c-terminus, down-
stream of a conserved glycine. this cleavage allows the
conjugation of atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)
through the exposed glycine, a process mediated through a
ubiquitination-like mechanism. atg8-pe serves as another
substrate for atg4, which cleaves atg8 and releases it from
the membrane. notably, this conjugation process must be
preceded by another ubiquitination-like process, conjugating
atg12 to atg5 (tanida et al, 2004b). in mammalian cells,
amino-acid deprivation induces lipidation of lc3 (kabeya
et al, 2000) as well as of gate-16 and gabarap (kabeya
et al, 2004). lipidated atg8s associate with phagophaores and
autophagosomes and remain there until fusion with lyso-
somes, at which point intra-autophagosomal atg8 is probably
degraded (kabeya et al, 2000, 2004).
at least four atg4 mammalian homologues have been
reported based on sequence homology to the yeast
saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc)atg4. two of the homologues,
hsatg4a and hsatg4b, were shown to cleave the three
mammalian atg8s with different efﬁciencies: hsatg4a
cleaves mainly gate-16, whereas hsatg4b cleaves all three
homologues (gate-16, gabarap and lc3), with the highest
efﬁciency for lc3 (kabeya et al, 2004).
atg4s act both as conjugating and deconjugating enzymes
and therefore their activity is expected to be tightly regulated.
hence, in the process of autophagy, following the initial
cleavage of atg8-like proteins, atg4 must become inactive
so as to ensure the conjugation of atg8 to the autophago-
somal membrane. later on, as the autophagosome fuses with
the lysosome, atg4 might be locally re-activated in order to
delipidate and recycle atg8. how is this regulation achieved?
we have previously shown that recombinant hsatg4a is
active as a cysteine protease of gate-16 only in the presence
of the reducing agent dtt (scherz-shouval et al, 2003). this

could implicate that, in vivo, the delipidating activity of atg4
is regulated through changes in redox potentials that take
place under different conditions and at speciﬁc subcellular
microenvironments. such regulation could be inﬂicted,
among other factors, by reactive oxygen species (ros). at
high levels, ros are deleterious to cells, leading to pro-
grammed cell death (pcd) (jabs, 1999; lee et al, 2003;
macip et al, 2003). at low levels, however, ros can serve
as signaling molecules, by oxidizing factors in a variety of
pathways that lead to growth and survival. here, we report
for the ﬁrst time the involvement of ros as signaling mole-
cules in nutrient starvation-induced autophagy, which is
essentially a survival pathway. we show that under starva-
tion conditions, cells form ros, speciﬁcally h2o2, which
is essential for autophagosome formation and autophagic
degradation. the oxidative signal is partially pi3k dependent
and leads to inhibition of atg4. using an in vitro assay, we
could demonstrate that h2o2 directly regulates hsatg4a.
moreover, we identiﬁed cys81, situated four amino acids
downstream of the active site, as an essential residue for
the redox regulation of hsatg4a. expression of hsatg4a
mutated in cys81, or the corresponding mutant of hsatg4b,
inhibited the formation of gate-16- or lc3-labeled auto-
phagosomes in cells.
results
starvation induces formation of ros
ros serve as signaling molecules in a variety of cellular
processes, including growth, differentiation, adhesion and
pcd. to test whether ros play a role in autophagy, we
measured ros production under starvation using a ﬂuores-
cent probe, dihydroethidum (dhe). dhe reacts with perox-
ides to form a compound that upon binding to dna
ﬂuoresces and can be visualized by confocal ﬂuorescent
microscopy (vanden hoek et al, 1997). indeed, upon nutrient
starvation, dhe staining was evident, indicating that cells
accumulate peroxides under these conditions (figure 1a). we
then used another probe, 20,70-dichloroﬂuorescin diacetate
(dcf-da), which reacts mainly with h2o2 to form a ﬂuor-
escent compound at the point of interaction (cathcart et al,
1983; vanden hoek et al, 1997). dcf staining was already
evident 15 min after the induction of starvation (figure 1bd
and supplementary figure 1a, see text below). the pattern of
dcf staining was punctated as well as cytosolic, and it was
also apparent following overnight starvation (figure 1bh).
these results indicate that h2o2 is most likely the oxidative
agent accumulating in starved cells. to rule out the possibility
that the oxidative signal associated with starvation is leading
to pcd, we tested the viability of cells grown under nutrient
starvation conditions. as shown in supplementary figure 1b,
5 h of nutrient starvation did not affect the viability of the
cells, and the percent of cell death was equally low in control
and starved cells. taken together with the ﬁnding that the
oxidative signal appears minutes after induction of starva-
tion, these results suggest that h2o2 serves as a signaling
molecule in the autophagic pathway, and not as part of an
oxidative stress leading to pcd.
the pattern of dcf staining resembled mitochondrial
staining, and therefore we double stained the cells with
dcf and mitotracker red, a marker for functional mitochon-
dria. we found signiﬁcant overlap between the two markers
(figure 1bf and j; enlargements in g and k, respectively). all
the dcf puncta either colocalized with or were in close
vicinity to mitotracker-stained structures, suggesting mito-
chondria as the source of ros generated during starvation.
this ﬁnding coincides with our observation that phago-
phores, identiﬁed by a double staining with atg5 and atg16
(mizushima et al, 2003), tend to colocalize with mitotracker
red-stained mitochondria (supplementary figure 1c), sug-
gesting a functional
link between ros generated in the
mitochondria during starvation and autophagosome forma-
tion. this result is consistent with recently reported ﬁndings
(kissova et al, 2006).
in order to assess the rise in ros in a more accurate
manner, we measured the increase in dcf ﬂuorescence
using a ﬂuorimeter set at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm
emission in two different cell lines (cho and hela). the
cells were either deprived of serum, completely starved
(deprived of serum and nutrients) or grown in control
medium for 2 h, after which they were treated with dcf
and the ﬂuorescent signal of the whole population (3 104
cells) was monitored. as shown in figure 1c, complete
starvation of the cells resulted in a dramatic increase in the
ﬂuorescent signal over time, as compared to the control,
whereas serum starvation had only a mild effect on the
ﬂuorescent signal, indicating a slight increase in ros produc-
tion. these measurements were further processed and sum-
marized as the increase in dcf ﬂuorescence over 20 min of
incubation with the reagent (figure 1d).
class iii pi3k is involved in starvation-dependent ros
formation
in the attempt to understand where ros production ﬁts in the
autophagic signaling pathway, we monitored the effect of two
known autophagy inhibitors, wortmannin and 3-methylade-
nine (3ma), on starvation-dependent dcf staining (petiot
et al, 2000). starvation of cells for a 2-h period in the presence
of either drug reduced the level of dcf ﬂuoresence by 25–
30% (figure 2a, left panel). as expected, the autophagic
activity in the treated cells, tested by the rate of degradation
of long-lived proteins (known to increase during autophagy,
see mizushima et al, 2001), was signiﬁcantly reduced
(figure 2a, right panel). wortmannin and 3ma are phospha-
tidyl inositol 3 kinase (pi3k) inhibitors. class iii pi3k plays a
critical role in the early stages of autophagosome formation
in mammals through formation of an essential complex with
beclin 1 and, hence, inhibition of its activity inhibits the
autophagic process (petiot et al, 2000; tassa et al, 2003). this
ﬁnding, therefore, indicates that ros production is partially
pi3k dependent. indeed, partial silencing of beclin 1 (pre-
viously shown to cause a partial autophagic defect; reef et al,
2006) or the pi3k hvps34 resulted in 15 and 20% (respec-
tively)
reduction in starvation-induced ros production
(supplementary figure 2a). notably, partial silencing of
hvps34 caused 30% reduction in the number of autophago-
somes per cell (supplementary figure 2b, lower right panel).
next, we assessed the level of dcf staining in cell lines
deleted for the atg5 gene, whose product is essential for
autophagosome formation, acting downstream of the class iii
pi3k (suzuki et al, 2001; tanida et al, 2004b). dcf staining in
the mutant cells did not decrease, as compared with control
cells (figure 2b), but rather increased signiﬁcantly (40–50%),
indicating that ros production takes place upstream of the

atg5-dependent step of autophagosome formation, and
suggesting that in the absence of a functional autophagic
pathway, cells accumulate ros.
ros formation is essential for autophagy
the results described above suggest that starvation induces
ros formation. but are ros essential for autophagy? to
address this question, we tested the effect of n-acetyl-l-
cysteine (nac), a general antioxidant, and catalase, which
speciﬁcally decomposes h2o2, on the formation of autopha-
gosomes using gate-16 and lc3 as markers. lc3 and gate-
16 were shown to label autophagosomes under starvation
conditions (kabeya et al, 2004; supplementary figure 3a),
and as shown in supplementary figure 3b, the two proteins

or absence of either 100 nm wortmannin or 10 mm 3ma, after which they were treated with dcfda and analyzed by a ﬂuorimeter as described

exhibit signiﬁcant colocalization under these conditions.
addition of either nac or catalase to the growth medium
(sakurai and cederbaum, 1998; preston et al, 2001; xu et al,
2003) of the cells for 10 min before a 2-h starvation period
resulted in reduced lipidation of gate-16 and lc3 and
abolished the formation of gate-16- and lc3-labeled auto-
phagosomes (figure 3a and supplementary figure 3c). as
expected, the same concentration of antioxidative reagents
signiﬁcantly reduced the level of ros in the treated cells
(figure 3b). these results were further validated by testing
the effect of antioxidants on starvation-induced protein
degradation (figure 3c). treatment with nac caused 60%
inhibition in starvation-induced degradation, and catalase
caused 25% inhibition in starvation-induced degradation.
taken together, we conclude that starvation conditions
induce formation of ros, which are required for induction
of autophagy. notably, treatment of cells with h2o2 alone did
not result in formation of autophagosomes (data not shown).
atg4 is attenuated in response to starvation in a
redox-dependent manner
next, we searched for a cellular target of the starvation-
induced oxidative signal. the amount of the lipidated form
of atg8s increases signiﬁcantly during starvation (kabeya
et al, 2004). as shown in figure 4a, this elevation,
in
mammalian atg8s, does not result from increased transcrip-
tion, as previously shown for scatg8 (kirisako et al, 1999).
consistently, we could not observe changes in the protein
levels of mammalian atg8s under these conditions (figure 4b
and data not shown). we therefore deduce that the increase
in lipidated mammalian atg8 proteins in response to nutrient
starvation is due to post-translational regulation of the pro-
cessing enzymes. to test this hypothesis, cells were starved
for 3 or 13 h, after which they were lysed and the lysates were
tested for their ability to cleave gate-16. in this assay,
recombinant gate-16, tagged at both termini (his6-gate-
16-ha), is used so that cleaved gate-16 can be detected by
its faster mobility in sds–page. as shown in figure 4c,
incubation of gate-16 in a lysate prepared from cells that
were starved for a short period of 3 h resulted in a decrease of
up to 40% in the cleavage activity as compared with control
cells. starvation of cells for longer periods of 13 h (during
which the cells are still viable) resulted in further inhibition
in cleavage activity. however, addition of 1 mm dtt to the
lysates brought about recovery of
the cleavage activity,
suggesting that the inhibition of atg4 was caused by oxida-
tion of the protein. consistently, treatment of cells with 1 mm
h2o2 for 1 h before lysis resulted in strong inhibition of the
cleavage activity of atg4 as compared with control cells.
addition of dtt to the lysate restored most of the lost
activity, conﬁrming that the inhibition by oxidation is rever-
sible. notably, the protein levels of the gate-16-speciﬁc
protease, hsatg4a, did not change under any of the tested
conditions (supplementary figure 4a), supporting the idea
that
the regulation of atg4 activity is post-translational.
speciﬁc anti-hsatg4a antibodies were utilized to conﬁrm
that the cleavage activity shown in figure 4c is mediated
by hsatg4a (for details see supplementary figure 4b),

is also inhibited during starvation, we transfected cells with
gate-16 tagged with myc at its n-terminus and ha at the
c-terminus, starved them for 30 min (a time period in which
autophagosomes are expected to form; fass et al, 2006) or
13 h and subjected them to a [35s]methionine pulse–chase
experiment as detailed in materials and methods (figure 4d).
the control experiment shows that two bands at approxi-
mately 19 kda are detected immediately after pulse labeling
in the transfected cells (figure 4d, left panel). a 1 h chase
resulted in disappearance of the upper band, suggesting that
this band corresponds to unprimed gate-16 (myc-gate-16-
ha), whereas the lower band corresponds to primed gate-16
(myc-gate-16). short starvation does not induce accumula-
tion of the unprimed form (figure 4d, middle panel), and this
form accumulates only in cells that were starved for a long
period of 13 h.
these results indicate that hsatg4a is redox regulated
during starvation. as the priming activity is not affected by
short starvation, we conclude that the delipidation activity is
the main target of this regulation.
to characterize the redox regulation of hsatg4, we
expressed hsatg4a as a recombinant protein and tested its
activity in the cell-free cleavage assay. as depicted in
figure 5a, the protease was gradually activated upon reduc-
tion of the reaction mixture and the activity saturated at 1 mm
dtt. next, we tested the inhibition of hsatg4a activity by
h2o2. the protein was preincubated in a low concentration of
dtt for activation followed by addition of h2o2 for 5 min
before incubation with gate-16 for the cleavage assay. the
activity of hsatg4a decreased as the h2o2 concentration
increased above 100 mm (figure 5b). in some experiments,
a slight increase in the protease activity was detected upon
addition of 30 mm h2o2 to the reaction mixture. finally, we
tested the reversibility of hsatg4 inhibition by h2o2. in this
experiment, the protein was preincubated in a low concen-
tration of dtt (figure 5c, lane 2) followed by addition of
h2o2 (lane 3) and then addition of a high concentration of
dtt (lane 4; each incubated for 5 min before addition of the
next reagent) before incubation with gate-16. under these
conditions, hsatg4a completely regained its activity. taken
together, these results show that reducing conditions activate
hsatg4a, whereas an oxidizing environment
inhibits its
activity. moreover, these results indicate that h2o2 alone is
sufﬁcient to reversibly inhibit the activity of hsatg4a in vitro,
and therefore suggest that h2o2 might also act directly on the
protease in vivo.
to the whole family (figure 6). one of
cys81 is a target for the redox regulation of hsatg4a
hsatg4a contains 12 cysteines, seven of which are highly
conserved among tetrapod homologues of atg4a and atg4b.

another conserved residue (cys81 in hsatg4a) is located four
sites downstream of the active residue. we ﬁrst sought to
determine whether cys77 is the catalytic residue, as suggested
by homology to scatg4 and hsatg4b. as shown in figure 7a,

gate-16 in vitro, neither in the absence nor in the presence
of dtt. based on this result and the sequence homology
described above, we conclude that cys77 is part of the active
site of hsatg4a.
to study the mechanism of redox regulation of hsatg4a,
we mutated the conserved cysteine residues 81 and 92
(figure 6a, small arrows), which are closest to the active
residue, to serine (his6-hsatg4ac81s and his6-hsatg4ac92s,
respectively) and tested their activity in the cell-free cleavage
assay of gate-16 under different redox conditions. as shown
in figure 7a, mutation in cys81 signiﬁcantly reduced the
redox sensitivity of hsatg4a so that his6-hsatg4ac81s was
partially active even in the absence of dtt. mutation in cys92,
however, had no effect on the regulation and the protease
remained under the same conditions as active as his6-
hsatg4awt (data not shown). next, we tested the effect of
oxidation by h2o2 on the activity of his6-hsatg4ac81s. we
found that the mutant protein retained signiﬁcant activity in
the presence of h2o2 (figure 7b) under conditions in which
the wt was completely inhibited (figure 5c). similar to the
wt, the partial inhibition of his6-hsatg4ac81s by h2o2 could
be reversed by addition of dtt. from these results, we
conclude that cys81 is important for redox regulation of
hsatg4a in vitro.
hsatg4a and hsatg4b are both redox regulated during
autophagy
to examine whether cys81 plays a role in the redox regulation
of hsatg4a in vivo, we monitored the formation of gfp-
gate-16-labeled autophagosomes in cells transfected with
hsatg4a mutants. expression of hsatg4ac81s signiﬁcantly
impaired the formation of gate-16-labeled autophagosomes
in starved cells (figure 8a), as compared with cells expres-
sing hsatg4awt (figure 8a) or hsatg4ac92s (data not
shown) at similar levels. the average number of autophago-
somes formed in hsatg4ac81s-expressing cells was 70%
lower than in hsatg4awt-expressing cells (figure 8a, lower
in the presence of

that

hsatg4ac81s, autophagosomes are formed, but then rapidly
degraded, and therefore cannot be seen. to exclude this
possibility, we inhibited the degradation of autophagosomes
in the lysosome using baﬁlomycin a (mousavi et al, 2001).
this treatment did not affect the mutant phenotype, indicat-
ing that autophagosomes do not form in cells transfected with
hsatg4ac81s (data not shown). the ﬁnding that gate-16-
labeled autophagosomes do not form in hsatg4ac81s-expres-
sing cells was further supported by gate-16 lipidation
measurements. as the hsatg4ac81s mutant is less sensitive
to oxidation, we expect the delipidation activity to be higher
in starved cells transfected with this mutant as compared
with cells transfected with hsatg4awt. indeed, we found
nearly 40% less of the lipidated form of gate-16 in cells
transfected with hsatg4ac81s as compared with cells trans-
fected with hsatg4awt (figure 8b). it should be mentioned
that expression of hsatg4ac81s did not affect the pattern of lc3
staining in the cells (data not shown), as expected, as hsatg4a
is speciﬁc for gate-16 and does not process lc3. taken
together, our ﬁndings support the notion that cys81 takes
part in the redox regulation of hsatg4a during autophagy.
in order to extend our study to other atg4 family members,
we decided to test the lc3-speciﬁc protease, hsatg4b. to
that end, we transfected cells with gfp-hsatg4bwt, gfp-
hsatg4bc78s or with gfp as control and tested the effect on
lipidation of lc3 and formation of lc3-labeled autophago-
somes. we found that overexpression of both gfp-
hsatg4bwt and gfp-hsatg4bc78s reduced autophagosome
formation and lipidation of lc3 (data not shown). this
phenomenon was previously reported for overexpression of
hsatg4bwt (tanida et al, 2004a). to overcome this problem,
we added h2o2 to the starvation media. under these condi-
tions, hsatg4bwt was inhibited and a normal autophagic
phenotype was observed (figure 9). hsatg4bc78s, however,
was resistant to h2o2 and the cells expressing this construct
failed to form lipidated lc3 and lc3-labeled autophago-
somes. these results indicate that hsatg4b, similar to
hsatg4a, is redox regulated.
discussion
autophagy is a unique pathway of intracellular trafﬁcking
activated in response to extracellular signals. although many
of the proteins involved in this process have been identiﬁed,
the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of
autophagy is not fully solved. here we demonstrate, for the
ﬁrst time, the involvement of ros as signaling molecules
in starvation-induced autophagy. we show that starvation
triggers accumulation of ros, most probably h2o2, which is
necessary for autophagosome formation and the resulting
pathway of degradation. the oxidative signal is partially pi3k
dependent, located upstream of the atg5-dependent conjuga-
tion machinery. furthermore, we identify a direct target for
oxidation by h2o2—the protease atg4.
based on our results, we propose the following model,
illustrated in figure 10: nutrient starvation induces complex
formation between class iii pi3k and beclin 1, which in turn
leads, together with other signals, to a local rise in h2o2 in
the vicinity of mitochondria. this oxidative signal leads to
inactivation of atg4 at the site of autophagosome formation,
thereby promoting lipidation of atg8, an essential step in the
process of autophagy. as the autophagosome matures to-

active cysteine residue among members of the atg4 family. sequences of the following accession numbers are aligned: bab83890, bab83889,

wards fusion with the lysosome, its localization apparently
changes to an h2o2-poor environment where atg4 is active
and can delipidate and recycle atg8.
how does h2o2 regulate atg4? atg4s are cysteine proteases
that share several conserved cysteine residues. one of these is
the catalytic residue, found previously in other members of
the atg4 family and shown here to be cys77 in hsatg4a.
another conserved motif is a cysteine residue located four
amino acids from the catalytic residue, cys81 in hsatg4a.
remarkably, we found this residue to be crucial for the redox
regulation of hsatg4a. mutation of this residue to serine
signiﬁcantly impaired the sensitivity of the protein to h2o2
in vitro, and abolished the formation of gate-16-labeled auto-
phagosomes in cells. the essentiality of this residue for proper
redox regulation was further conﬁrmed by the ﬁnding that the
corresponding hsatg4b mutant (hsatg4bc78s) exhibited a
similar autophagic defect. our in vitro study shows that
h2o2 directly inactivates atg4. this could be accomplished
either by binding of h2o2 to cys77 or to cys81, forming
reversible sulfenic acid that shields cys77, or by oxidation,

which leads to other modiﬁcations such as formation of a
disulﬁde bond between cys77 and cys81, again shielding cys77.
such a disulﬁde bond, however, was not detected in our
experiments (unpublished data). alternatively, h2o2 might
be affecting a different site, which is altered when cys81 is

mutated. the active site, cys77, is conserved from yeast to
man, whereas cys81 is conserved only in tetrapod homologues
of atg4a and atg4b. lower species harbor a conserved ser or
thr in this residue and hence the choice of a c81s mutant. we
thus propose that the redox regulation may be mediated via
cys77 in lower species, whereas tetrapods evolved a more
complex mechanism of regulation that requires both cys77
and cys81, where the latter provides tetrapods with higher
sensitivity to ros than lower species. the recently solved
three-dimentional structure of hsatg4b (sugawara et al,
2005; kumanomidou et al, 2006) supports our model, as it
shows cys77 and cys81 to be situated at the beginning of an a-
helix, both facing the same plane of the helix. with such close
proximity between the two cysteines, modiﬁcations on cys81
could indeed affect the active site. notably, both crystals were
prepared under reducing conditions, and consequently no
disulﬁde bridges or other modiﬁcations were reported for
any of the cysteine residues.

they can undergo rapid, variable and, most importantly,
reversible post-translational modiﬁcations in response to
changes in the oxidative conditions of
the environment
(sitia and molteni, 2004). several cysteine proteases, includ-
ing cathepsin d, cathepsin b and the cytosolic caspase-3
(chandler et al, 1998) and calpains (glading et al, 2001),
have been shown to undergo redox regulation through a
direct modiﬁcation of
the active site (reviewed in giles
et al, 2003). redox regulation of atg4 can provide
rapid activation and inactivation of this protease, as part
of the signaling pathway, leading to induction of the autop-
hagic process.
a growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy plays
a dual role, both in survival and in death-related pathways
(cuervo, 2003; codogno and meijer, 2005; reef et al, 2006).
the data available till now, linking ros with autophagy,
describe the death-related pathway, known as type ii pcd,
which is induced by high levels of ros (i.e. oxidative stress;
yu et al, 2004; kifﬁn et al, 2006). recently, it has been shown
that caspase inhibition leading to cell death through auto-
phagy involves accumulation of ros, owing to catalase-
speciﬁc autophagic degradation.
in that study, however,
starvation did not lead to a similar effect (yu et al, 2006).
in our system, the rise in ros is both local and reversible; it is
not deleterious to cells and serves to oxidize a speciﬁc target.
therefore, our study provides the ﬁrst indication for the
involvement of ros in starvation-induced autophagy as
signaling molecules in a survival pathway.
materials and methods
all experiments presented in the results section were repeated at
least three times unless indicated otherwise.
expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins
recombinant his6-hsatg4a (wt and the mutants described in
supplementary data) and his6-gate-16-ha were expressed from
the pqe-30 plasmid and puriﬁed as described previously (scherz-
shouval et al, 2003). puriﬁcation of his6-hsatg4a (wt and
mutants) was carried out in the presence of 10 mm bme to prevent
formation of nonspeciﬁc disulﬁde bonds; however, before its use,
the protein was diluted to at least 30-fold or dialyzed in a buffer
lacking bme.
cell culture, transfection, reagents and immunoﬂuorescence
all cell lines were grown in a-mem medium (biological industries,
israel) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and referred to as
control medium. atg5 /  mefs and anti-atg16 polyclonal
antibodies were a kind gift from the laboratory of dr mizushima
(the tokyo metropolitan institute of medical science). stable
clones of gfp-gate-16-, gfp-lc3- or yfp-atg5-transfected cho
cells were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin (g418). starvation was
carried out in ebss. details regarding the use of different reagents
for tissue culture treatments are described in supplementary data.
transfections of cho cells were preformed with lipofectamine
(invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. transfections
of hela and hek 293 cells were performed by the standard calcium
phosphate technique. for immunoﬂuoresence, unless described
otherwise, cells were ﬁxed in methanol, permeabilized with acetone
and then incubated with the indicated antibodies and visualized by
a nikon eclipse te300 ﬂuorescent microscope or by an olympus
ix-70 confocal microscope.
hydrogen peroxide measurements
h2o2 was measured using 50 mmdhe (molecular probes) and 30 mm
dcfda (molecular probes). see supplementary data for details.
the ﬂuorescent signal was detected by an olympus ix-70 confocal
microscope. each experiment was repeated at least three times and
representative images are shown. the dcfda signal was also
measured by a spectramax gimini ﬂuorimeter, set
to 485
excitation and 535 emission and kept at 371c, for 40 min. data
collected from the ﬂuorometric measurements were analyzed as
detailed in supplementary data. the results presented for all
ﬂuorimetric measurements are the means7s.d. of at least three
experiments in duplicate or triplicate.
protein degradation assay
the assay was preformed on cho cells according to the protocol
described by fass et al (2006). when required, 10 mm 3ma, 100 nm
wortmannin, 1000 m/ml catalase or 10 mm nac were added.
notably, nac was added for 10 min before starvation induction
and catalase was added 14 h before starvation. [14c]valine release
was calculated as a percentage of the radioactivity in the tca-
soluble supernatant relative to the total cell radioactivity.
preparation of cell lysates
cells were homogenized in ripa buffer (0.1 m nacl, 5 mm edta,
0.1 m na2hpo4/nah2po4, ph 7.5, 1% triton, 0.5% doc, 0.1%
sds and protease inhibitors) by vortexing on ice. the homogenates
were centrifuged for 15 min at 20 000 g and the supernatant
containing the lysate was collected.
mrna measurement
rna was isolated by tri-reagent (molecular research center inc.) as
detailed in supplementary data.

pulse–chase experiment
hela cells were transiently transfected with myc-gate-16-ha or
with an empty vector. cells were then kept in full medium for 24 h,
after which they were either incubated in methionine-free medium
for 10 min or starved in ebss for 30 min (2 10 cm plates). for long
starvation, the cells (three plates) were shifted to ebss 10 h post-
transfection for 13 h, after which the medium was replaced with
fresh ebss. all cells were then pulse-labeled with 0.2 mci of
[35s]methionine for 10 min at 371c, and either chased in full
medium for 1 h at 371c or lysed immediately on ice, in ripa buffer
supplemented with 0.5 mm n-ethylmaleimide (sigma). lysates
were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibodies and analyzed
on 15% sds–page.
