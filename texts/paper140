autophagy is a catabolic membrane-trafficking process that
occurs in all eukaryotic cells and leads to the hydrolytic degra-
dation of cytosolic material in the vacuolar or lysosomal lumen.
mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy targeting mitochon-
dria, is poorly understood at present. several recent reports sug-
gest that mitophagy is a selective process that targets damaged
mitochondria, whereas other studies imply a role for mitophagy
in cell death processes. in a screen for protein phosphatase
homologs that functionally interact with the autophagy-dedi-
cated protein kinase atg1p in yeast, we have identified aup1p,
encoded by saccharomyces cerevisiae reading frame ycr079w.
aup1p is highly similar to a family of protein phosphatase
homologs in animal cells that are predicted to localize to mito-
chondria based on sequence analysis. interestingly, we found
that aup1p localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space
and is required for efficient mitophagy in stationary phase cells.
viability studies demonstrate that aup1p is required for effi-
cient survival of cells in prolonged stationary phase cultures,
implying a pro-survival role for mitophagy under our working
conditions. our data suggest that aup1p may be part of a signal
transduction mechanism that marks mitochondria for seques-
tration into autophagosomes.
mitochondria perform numerous essential physiological
functions in all eukaryotic cells. apart from their role in oxida-
tive phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, they are also
essential for biosynthesis of central building blocks such as
amino acids and nucleotides. at the same time, mitochondria
are a threat to cellular well-being. mitochondria are a major
source of reactive oxygen species in cells. in addition, disrup-
tion of mitochondrial compartmentalization results in leakage
of cytochrome c and other cytotoxic factors, and mitochondria
with defective chemiosmotic coupling can cause an energy
drain on the cell. accumulation of mitochondrial genetic vari-
ation and mitochondrial damage are widely considered to

underlie many age-related metabolic diseases and late-onset
genetic disorders (1, 2). it is commonly postulated that in nor-
mal cells defective mitochondria are broken down in the lyso-
somal compartment through autophagy, and inability to clear
defective mitochondria is thought to underlie numerous path-
ological conditions (3, 4).
autophagy is a set of catabolic membrane trafficking mech-
anisms that allow import of cytosolic material into the vacuole/
lysosome. the best understood form of autophagy is macroau-
tophagy, in which intracellular membranes of undetermined
origin engulf cytosolic material to form a double or multi-bi-
layer membrane bound intermediate called the autophagosome
(reviewed in refs. 3 and 5–8). this intermediate then goes on to
fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing a single-bilayer
bound vesicle called an autophagic body into the lumen of the
lytic compartment where it is broken down, releasing the
cytosol-derived material for further degradation to biosyn-
thetic building blocks. classical macroautophagy is induced
under starvation conditions and is largely thought to be a non-
specific process, although some central cellular structures are
clearly off limits under normal conditions, and there have been
reports of selective degradation of some proteins (9). this type
of starvation-induced autophagy is essential for surviving nutri-
ent deprivation in all eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals.
microautophagy is a related process whereby the vacuolar/ly-
sosomal membrane invaginates and pinches into the lumen,
forming an autophagic body without first forming a free auto-
phagosome. there are a number of selective autophagic path-
ways, which appear to target specific cellular components. the
cvt2 pathway, for example, is an autophagic pathway in yeast
that is highly similar to macroautophagy yet functions in the
biosynthetic routes of two known proteins, aminopeptidase i
and ␣-mannosidase, without delivering any additional known
cargo to the vacuolar lumen (10–12). aminopeptidase i, or
ape1p, is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes as a 61-kda pre-
cursor and is then specifically recruited to cvt vesicles that are
analogous to autophagosomes. upon fusion of cvt vesicles with
the limiting membrane of the vacuole the protein is released
into the vacuole lumen. within the vacuole, prape1 is proteo-
lytically processed to yield the mature 50-kda form in a pep4p-

a mitochondrial protein phosphatase required for mitophagy
and prb1p -dependent fashion. whereas most of the protein
factors required for cvt trafficking and for macroautophagy are
identical, there exist cvt pathway-specific factors that are dis-
pensable for macroautophagy, and autophagy-specific factors
that are not required in the cvt pathway (3).
an additional example of a selective autophagic pathway is
pexophagy, or the degradation of peroxisomes. like the cvt
pathway, pexphagy also occurs via a mechanism which shows
mechanistic overlaps with classical macroautophagy, but is an
inducible, not a constitutive phenomenon (13).
recent studies in yeast and in mammalian cells have uncov-
ered experimental conditions in which mitochondria are
degraded through mitophagy, in response to environmental
insults. specifically, it was shown that when cells are transferred
from rich glucose-based medium into a nitrogen starvation
medium with lactate as a carbon source, large scale mitophagy
is observed. this response appears to depend on uth1p, a mito-
chondrial outer membrane protein that is also involved in cell
longevity and bax-induced cell death (14, 15). in addition, it was
suggested that yeast cells with a temperature-sensitive mito-
chondrial proton atpase undergo mitophagy under anaerobic
conditions at restrictive temperature (16). finally, studies in rat
hepatocytes suggest that the mitochondrial permeability tran-
sition pore (mpt) regulates mitochondrial autophagy (17).
intriguing links have recently surfaced between mitochon-
drial regulation and macroautophagy. reggiori et al. (18)
reported that atg9p, an integral membrane protein required for
autophagy, cycles between mitochondria and the preautopha-
gosomal structure (pas), which is thought to be an assembly
point for autophagosomes (18). in mammalian cells, a short
isoform of the tumor suppressor p19 arf was found to localize
to mitochondria and induce macroautophagy (19).
atg1p is a protein kinase required for both classical, starva-
tion-induced macroautophagy as well as for the selective vari-
ants of autophagy such as the cvt pathway and pexophagy.
atg1p was also shown to be required for the cycling of atg9p
between the pas and the mitochondria (20). we previously
reported (21) that truncation of the c-terminal 18 amino acids
of atg1p abrogates the cvt pathway, yet still allows autophagic
trafficking under nitrogen starvation conditions. in addition,
the truncated version of atg1p (atg1⌬880) is constitutively
hypophosphorylated, whereas wild-type protein was phospho-
rylated in rich medium and dephosphorylated upon starvation.
to better understand the regulation of atg1p, we searched for
protein phosphatase homologs that genetically interact with
the atg1p protein kinase, by searching for phosphatase homo-
log deletion mutants that would show a synthetic interaction
with the atg1⌬880 mutant. one phosphatase homolog identi-
fied in this fashion is encoded by the previously uncharacter-
ized open reading frame ycr079w, which we have renamed
aup1. in this report, we present a functional characterization
of aup1p. aup1p is a highly conserved protein that localizes to
the mitochondrial intermembrane space. surprisingly, while it
is not absolutely required for classical starvation-induced mac-
roautophagy, we find that it is required for effective mitophagy
in stationary phase yeast cells. these data suggest that aup1
may be part of a signal transduction mechanism that marks
mitochondria for selective degradation through mitophagy.
experimental procedures
yeast strains and culture conditions—the strains used in
this study are listed in table 1. strains were grown in synthetic
dextrose medium (sd; 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2%
(w/v) glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as
required) or synthetic lactate medium (slm; 0.67% (w/v) yeast
nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) lactate, and auxotrophic amino acids
and vitamins as required). nitrogen starvation was carried out
in sd-n (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without ammonium
sulfate and amino acids and 2% (w/v) glucose). yeast transfor-
mation was according to (23). to generate strain hay670, a
pcr-amplified cassette was synthesized using plasmid pfa6–
3ha-his3mx6 (24) as template. this cassette carries the
schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 gene, and at its 5⬘-end con-
tains a coding region for 3 repetitions of the 9 amino acid influ-
enza virus hemagglutinin (ha) epitope followed by a stop
codon. the ha codons are fused in-frame to the c terminus of
the aup1 reading frame as encoded by the 5⬘ pcr primer over-
hang, while the 3⬘ pcr primer contains an overhang homolo-
gous to 3⬘-untranslated region of the aup1 gene (all primer
sequences will be provided upon request). integration of this
cassette creates a chromosomal aup1 gene fused to the ha
epitope at its c terminus, as verified by pcr and western blot-
ting. to generate strain hay695, strain hay469 was trans-
formed with a pcr cassette synthesized using phab102 (21) as
template, to create a truncation/fusion of the atg1 reading
frame with the protein a tag at amino acid 880. strain hay805
was created by transforming strain hay75 with a pcr-ampli-
fied cassette carrying the monomeric rfp sequence fused in-
frame to the 40 3⬘-nucleotides of the vph1 reading frame and
the kanamycin resistance gene, synthesized using plasmid
phab152 as template (see below). strain hay809 was gener-
ated by integrating a pcr-amplified cassette carrying the
s. pombe his5 gene flanked by short regions of homology to
regions upstream and downstream of the aup1 gene, to gener-
ate an aup1⌬::his5 genotype, as verified by diagnostic pcr.
strain hay831 was generated by transforming strain hay75
first with a pcr-amplified cassette carrying the rfp open read-
ing frame fused in-frame to the 40 3⬘-nucleotides of the cox9
reading frame (generated using phab152 as template) and car-
rying the kanr selectable marker to create strain hay829,
which was then transformed with a second pcr-amplified cas-
sette carrying the gfp open reading frame fused in-frame to the
3⬘-40 nucleotides of the aup1 reading frame and carrying the
his5 selectable marker (generated using plasmid pfa6a-
gfp(s65t)-his3mx6 (24) as template). both aup1-ha and
aup1-gfp constructs were functional as assessed by complemen-
tation of the rapamycin sensitivity of the aup1⌬ mutant (25).

plasmids and genetic manipulations—plasmid phab152
was constructed by excising the paci-asci fragment of plasmid
pfa6a-kanmx6 (24), and ligating a paci-asci pcr amplicon of
the mrfp reading frame (26) synthesized with paci and asci
overhangs, into the linearized plasmid. the resulting insert
contains the mrfp sequence preceded by 2 glycines as an
optional linker. plasmid pyx142, encoding a mitochondrial
gfp marker (27), was a gift from dr. benedict westermann.
cell fractionation and membrane extraction procedures—
30 a600 units (or as indicated in specific experiments) of expo-
nentially growing cells were collected, washed, and sphero-
plasted for 30 min at 30 °c in slm supplemented with 1 m
sorbitol and 40 mm hepes-koh, ph 7.4, and 300 ␮g/ml lyti-
case (icn) for 30 min at 30 °c. all subsequent operations were
at 4 °c. spheroplasts were centrifuged at 2000 ⫻ g in a hermle
z400k refrigerated centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor and
resuspended at a concentration of 6 a600 units/ml in ice-cold
lysis buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm
edta, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml antipain,
1 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin, 10
␮g/ml ␣2-macroglobulin, and 40 mm hepes-koh, ph 7. cells
were ruptured by homogenization (15 strokes) in a 7-ml dounce
homogenizer (kimble-kontes) using a tight fitting pestle. the
crude homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 300 ⫻ g
for 5 min using a fixed-angle rotor. clarified lysate (s300) was
centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 ⫻ g to generate p1500, and the
supernatant was re-centrifuged 10 min at 12,500 ⫻ g to gener-
ate pellet (p13) and supernatant (s13) fractions. s300, p1500,
p13, and s13 fractions were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichlo-
roacetic acid, washed twice with cold acetone, and solubilized
in sds-page sample buffer. from each fraction, 2 a600 unit
equivalents of cell extract were loaded per lane, separated by
sds-page and analyzed by immunoblotting.
purification of mitochondria on nycodenz gradients was
according to glick and pon (28). gradient fractions were precipi-
tated with 10% trichloroacetic acid prior to immunoblot analysis.
for membrane extraction experiments, p13 fractions gener-
ated as above were resuspended in 100 mm na2co3 (ph 11), in
hypotonic buffer (80 mm sorbitol, 20 mm pipes-koh, ph 7) or
in standard fractionation lysis buffer (see above). following a
30-min incubation, the different samples were collected by cen-
trifugation at 12,500 ⫻ g for 10 min, divided into pellet and
supernatant fractions, and proteins were precipitated with 10%
trichloroacetic acid followed by two washes with cold acetone.
samples were solubilized in sds-page sample buffer and ana-
lyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting.
protease protection assays—50 a600 units of cells were
spheroplasted, and p13 fractions were generated as above. the
pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer or in hypotonic buffer (80
mm sorbitol, 20 mm pipes-koh, ph 7) at a concentration of 0.3
a600 equivalents/␮l. time 0 samples (12 a equivalents) were with-
drawn and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. proteinase
k was added to the main sample to a final concentration of 0.3
␮g/ml, and samples were taken at the indicated time points. reac-
tions were quenched by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic
acid followed by two washes in cold acetone. samples were ana-
lyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting as above.
fluorescence microscopy—typically, culture samples were
placed on standard microscope slides (3 ␮l) and viewed using a
nikon e600 upright fluorescent microscope equipped with a
⫻100 plan fluor objective, using a fitc fluorescent filter (for
viewing gfp fluorescence) or a cy3 filter (for viewing mrfp).
to achieve statistically significant numbers of cells per viewing
fielding in some pictures, high cell densities were achieved by
sedimenting 1 ml of cells for 30 s at 500 ⫻ g and resuspending
the pellet in 10 ␮l of medium.
quantitative western blotting—to follow protein levels over
time with minimal bias, cultures were sampled (10 a600 unit
equivalents per sample), and samples were precipitated with
tca followed by acetone washes. cells were disrupted by a
5-min agitation with 100-␮l glass beads (425–600-␮m diame-
ter) in 100 ␮l of cracking buffer (6 m urea, 1% sds, 1 mm edta,
50 mm tris-cl, ph 6.8). an additional 100 ␮l of cracking buffer
was added, and the suspension was mixed and centrifuged 5
min at 14,000 ⫻ g. clarified lysate was transferred to a new tube,
and protein levels were determined using the bca protein assay
kit (pierce). for typical immunoblot analysis 15 ␮g of protein per

pathway. however, upon starvation one observes rapid matu-
ration of the precursor and the appearance of the mature form
of ape1p, mape1 because of proteolytic processing in the vac-
uolar lumen. this type of nutrient-induced shift in ape1p traf-
ficking can be used to assay mechanistic aspects of the
induction of macroautophagy (29–32). to identify protein
phosphatases that potentially interact with the atg1 protein
kinase, we screened for mutants that, in the genetic background
of the atg1⌬880 allele, would cause a synthetic phenotype such
that autophagic trafficking of prape1 would be abolished. to
this end we assayed 32 knockouts of protein phosphatase
homologs from the yeast deletion library (33) for loss of viability
on starvation plates using phloxine b as a vital dye (34). of these
strains, 6 showed characteristic pink coloration because of loss
of viability on starvation and were then further analyzed by
integration of the atg1⌬880 cassette into the atg1 locus for
analysis of ape1p trafficking. one of these homologs,
deleted for open reading frame ycr079w, showed a clear
synthetic effect on prape1 maturation: whereas the phos-
phatase homolog deletion alone had no effect on prape1 mat-
uration, and the atg1⌬880 mutant was able to mature prape1
under nitrogen starvation, the double mutant was unable to
mature ape1p either in rich medium or nitrogen starvation
conditions (fig. 1). because ycr079w was not previously char-
acterized, we decided to name it aup1p, for autophagy-related
protein phosphatase.
aup1p localizes to mitochondria—surprisingly, sequence
analysis of aup1p using the mitoprot ii algorithm (35) revealed
a high propensity for mitochondrial localization of the protein.
indeed, an aup1-gfp fusion strongly co-localizes with a red
fluorescent protein fusion of the mitochondrial inner mem-
brane marker cytochrome c oxidase
subunit viia (cox9-rfp), when
cells are grown in 2% lactate
medium (fig. 2). however, upon
long term (3–4 days) incubation, a
clear shift in this co-localization was
observed. whereas the gfp fluores-
cence remained distributed in the
cytoplasm,
the rfp fluorescence
appeared to concentrate at a central
location which roughly coincided
with the vacuole, although cytoplas-
mic puncta are still observed as well.
this result suggested to us that
mitochondria are being delivered to
the vacuole under these conditions.
because there are no reports in the
literature regarding massive mito-
phagy under these conditions, we
chose to characterize this phenom-
enon in more detail. to determine
whether the observation shown in
fig. 3 was limited to a specific marker
protein or fluorophore combination,
we used cells expressing a generic
mitochondrialgfpmarkerandavac-
uolar vph1-rfp marker. in addition,

aup1p is required for efficient mitophagic degradation of
aconitase—to verify that the fluorescent experiments repre-
sent bona fide mitophagy, we also followed the levels of aconi-
tase, a protein residing in the mitochondrial matrix, using
quantitative western blotting. as seen in fig. 4a, aconitase
levels drop sharply between the second and third day of incu-
bation, consistent with the fluorescent microscopy data. fur-
thermore, this decrease was not observed in pep4⌬ mutants.
pep4p is the major vacuolar protease and is required for the
activation of most other vacuolar hydrolases: in its absence the
vacuole does not efficiently degrade incoming proteins. the
lack of aconitase degradation in pep4⌬ cells implies that the
degradation process occurs in the vacuole, and by definition,
therefore, constitutes a form of mitophagy. because we initially
identified aup1p as a genetic interactor of atg1p, and because it
localizes to mitochondria in a way that correlates with the onset
of mitophagy (fig. 2), we also tested whether aup1⌬ and atg1⌬
cells are defective in stationary phase mitophagy. aup1 was
previously shown to be a nonessential gene (36). as shown in
fig. 4a, aup1⌬ cells are completely defective in stationary
phase mitophagy whereas atg1⌬ cells also show a reduced level
of mitophagy. we then used quantitative western blotting to
ask whether aup1p protein levels temporally correlate with its
point of action during mitophagy. to this end, we c-terminally
tagged aup1p with the ha epitope derived from the influenza
virus hemagglutinin protein, and followed its levels using anti-ha
antibodies. the aup1-ha chimera is functional, as assayed by
rapamycin sensitivity (see “experimental procedures”). as seen in
fig. 4b, aup1p levels sharply peak during the second day of incu-

hay670, expressing aup1-ha, was grown overnight in smd to log phase,
spheroplasted, lysed, and fractionated as described under “experimental pro-
cedures.” s300, p1500, p13, and s13 fractions (10 a600 unit equivalents each)
were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to tom70 (mitochondrial
outer membrane), hexokinase (hxk1; cytosol), alkaline phosphatase (pho8;
vacuole), kar2 (er), sed5 (golgi), or the ha epitope. b, p13 fractions isolated in
a were resuspended in lysis buffer and loaded on a 5–25% nycodenz gradient
(see “experimental procedures”). following centrifugation, the gradient was
fractionated from the top, and the fractions were precipitated with 10% tri-
chloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting.

observed in figs. 3 and 4a.
aup1p localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space—
one interpretation of these data is that aup1p functions
directly in mediating mitophagy. to better understand the
potential ways in which aup1p may be involved in such a mech-
anism, we decided to investigate the manner of its association
with the mitochondrion. aup1p may be a peripheral membrane

permeabilized by hypotonic treatment. strain hay670 was grown to log
phase and lysed as in the legend to fig. 5. p13 fractions were resuspended in
lysis buffer (upper panels) or hypotonic buffer (lower panel) and digested with
proteinase k for the indicated times as described under “experimental proce-
dures.” after the reactions were quenched, samples were analyzed by immu-
noblotting with anti-ha (for both treatments), anti-tom70 (upper panel, as
positive control for proteinase k digestion in whole mitochondria), anti-cyto-
chrome b2 (lower panel, as positive control for mitochondrial outer mem-
brane permeabilization), or anti-aconitase (lower panel, as control for mito-
chondrial inner membrane integrity).
12,500 ⫻ g, as expected for mitochondrial proteins, while kar2
(endoplasmic reticulum) sed5 (golgi) and hexokinase (cytosol)
are either underrepresented in this fraction or completely
absent. not surprisingly, the vacuolar marker pho8 shows a
similar distribution. to resolve vacuolar and mitochondrial
components we resuspended the p13 fraction in lysis buffer and
loaded it on a 5–25% nycodenz gradient. as seen in fig. 5b,
aup1-ha co-fractionates with tom70 in this gradient and well
away from pho8. these results corroborate the fluorescent
microscopy data of fig. 2. to understand how aup1p associates
with the mitochondrion, we tested whether aup1-ha can be
extracted from the 13,000 ⫻ g pellet by treatment with 100 mm
na2co3 or under hypotonic conditions. na2co3 treatment
strips peripheral membrane proteins and soluble luminal pro-
teins (37), while hypotonic conditions disrupt the outer mito-
chondrial membrane, releasing soluble intermembrane pro-
teins as well as loosely associated peripheral membrane
proteins (38) (fig. 6). as seen in fig. 6, aup1-ha is stripped by
na2co3, but not by hypotonic treatment although cytochrome
b2, a soluble intermembrane protein, is clearly released by
hypotonic treatment. this implies that aup1p is not a soluble
intermembrane protein or an integral membrane protein, but
does not indicate which submitochondrial compartment it
associates with. to address this issue, we treated resuspended
13,000 ⫻ g pellets with proteinase k either in lysis buffer or
under hypotonic conditions. as seen in fig. 7, aup1-ha is not
sensitive to proteinase k when the resuspended 13,000 ⫻ g
pellet is challenged with proteinase k in lysis buffer, in contrast
to tom70p, an integral outer membrane protein that faces the
cytosol. this makes it very unlikely that aup1p is peripherally
associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the outer membrane
of the mitochondrion. however when the 13,000 ⫻ g pellet is
resuspended in hypotonic buffer and challenged with protein-
ase k, aup1p becomes sensitive to exogenous proteinase k, as is
cytochrome b2, a soluble intermembrane protein. as a control,
figure 8. aup1p is required for efficient survival during long term sta-
tionary phase cultures. wild-type (hay75) and hay809 cells were grown to
equivalent densities in smd. aliquots were removed at the indicated time
points and spread onto ypd plates in triplicate. the number of colonies was
counted after a 4-day incubation at 30 °c.
one can see that aconitase, a luminal protein, is not degraded
under these conditions, indicating that the inner membrane is
not disrupted and that the sensitivity of aup1-ha to proteinase
k reflects the disruption of the outer membrane alone. in sum-
mary, because aup1-ha is not released from the pellet by
hypotonic treatment alone, yet becomes sensitive to exogenous
proteinase k under these conditions, the simplest explanation
is that aup1p is a peripheral membrane protein associating
with one of the two membranes that face the intermembrane
space.
aup1p is required for efficient survival in long term sta-
tionary phase cultures—the role of autophagy and mitophagy
in cell survival has been a point of some debate in the literature.
whereas some authors contend that autophagy is strictly a cell
survival mechanism related to starvation stress, others have
suggested a role for autophagy in programmed cell death (6,
39–46). indeed, under some conditions it has been argued that
mitophagy in s. cerevisiae correlates with cell death phenomena
(14, 16). to determine whether the role of aup1p in mitophagy
reflects a cell survival mechanism or a cell death mechanism
under our conditions, we compared the viability of wild-type
and aup1⌬ cells incubated in slm over the time scales in which
mitophagy occurs. as shown in fig. 8, wild-type cells slowly lose
viability over a 9-day incubation period in slm, to ⬃30% of the
initial viable cell counts. in contrast, viable counts of the aup1⌬
mutant reached saturation later than wild type (on day 2) and
rapidly lost viability between days 4 and 6, reaching less than 1%
of the initial counts by day 6. interestingly, the onset of the rapid
loss of viability in the aup1⌬ cells correlates with the onset of
mitophagy (days 2 and 3). these results are consistent with a
cell survival role for aup1p, and potentially for mitophagy,
under our working conditions.
aup1p is the s. cerevisiae ortholog of a highly conserved
family of pp1k homologs—aup1p is a mitochondrial protein
with significant homology to the protein phosphatase 2c fam-
ily, and analysis on the ncbi dart program clearly indicates
the existence of a pp2c catalytic motif. however the similarity
between aup1p and the other pp2c family members in s. cer-
evisiae is weak. s. cerevisiae ptc1, ptc2, and ptc3 are not found

in an unbiased blast search (47) of all nonredundant protein
databases using aup1p as a query. in pairwise blast analysis,
one observes respective % identity (and expect) values for align-
ment of aup1p with ptc1, ptc2, and ptc3 as being 24% (expect
value 3.0), 29% (expect value 5.2), and no significant similarity
(for ptc3). in contrast, human, canine, and murine mitochon-
drial protein phosphatase 1k, (pp1k, pp2c domain containing,
all functionally uncharacterized proteins) are all identified in an
unbiased blast search using aup1p as query, with % identity
and expect values for these comparisons being 31% (expect
value of 5 ⫻ 10⫺11), 29% (expect value of 4 ⫻ 10⫺10), and 29%
(expect value 3 ⫻ 10⫺10), respectively. this implies that aup1p
is a s. cerevisiae pp1k ortholog. the lack of additional s. cerevi-
siae proteins with significant homology to aup1p (beyond their
common pp2c motif) renders it unlikely that it is functionally
redundant with the other members of the pp2c family in yeast.
hence, these comparisons define a conserved eukaryotic mito-
chondrial protein phosphatase family that may share a func-
tional role in mitophagy.
discussion
the clearance of damaged mitochondria is an important
household chore in eukaryotic cells (1, 4). this is even more
pronounced in cells utilizing oxidative phosphorylation as the
main mode for production of energy, as is the case for yeast
growing on lactate medium. damaged mitochondria can gen-
erate reactive oxygen species, release cell death-inducing fac-
tors such as cytochrome c into the cytosol, or generally burden
the metabolic machinery of the cell by decreasing the efficiency
of atp generation. numerous inherited diseases caused by
mitochondrial mutations have been described, and somatic
variation and mutation of mitochondria is suggested to under-
lie additional pathologies (2, 48).
the cellular ability to recognize and delete damaged mito-
chondria is therefore a vital aspect of aerobic life. it is generally
assumed that such clearance occurs by sequestration of mito-
chondria by the lytic compartment, i.e. the lysosome in animal
cells or the vacuole in yeast. such sequestration, by definition,
constitutes a form of specific autophagy, although the precise
mechanisms involved are currently obscure.
pioneering studies of mitophagy in yeast (15, 16) utilized
experimental scenarios that are unlikely to be encountered by
free living cells in their natural environment. in contrast, this
study represents an effort to analyze mitophagy during pro-
longed stationary phase incubation of aerobic yeast cultures, in
the absence of additional manipulation.
aup1p is a protein phosphatase homolog required for effi-
cient mitophagy—we describe the identification and charac-
terization of aup1p, a yeast protein phosphatase homolog that
functionally interacts with the autophagy-dedicated protein
kinase atg1p. whereas deletion of aup1 does not cause a
defect in starvation-induced macroautophagy (fig. 1 and data
not shown), the mitochondrial localization of the protein and
the loss of this localization during mitophagy prompted us to
analyze its potential role in mitophagy. our experiments indi-
cate that aup1p is required for efficient mitophagy and that its
function is required for survival of cells through prolonged sta-
tionary phase incubation in a medium containing lactate as car-
bon source. these results imply a pro-survival role for mitoph-
agy, under our working conditions.
several recent studies have pointed to a potential connection
between mitochondrial function and autophagy,
including
classical macroautophagy. reggiori et al. (18, 20) report that
atg9p, a membrane protein that is essential for starvation-in-
duced macroautophagy, cycles between a mitochondrial local-
ization and an autophagy-specific structure called the pas. a
mechanistic involvement of mitochondrial metabolism in the
regulation of macroautophagy is reasonable, given the central
importance of the mitochondrion to amino acid metabolism,
through anaplerotic functions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
uth1p, a peripheral membrane protein of the cytoplasmic
face of the mitochondrial outer membrane, was recently shown
to be required for selective mitophagy in cells challenged with
rapamycin, concomitantly with a switch between fermentative
and gluconeogenic culture conditions (15). while both uth1p
and aup1p are required for mitophagy, their effects on the
physiological role of the process appear to be different: knock-
out of uth1 results in increased viability of cells transferred
from nitrogen replete medium containing glucose to nitrogen
starvation medium containing lactate as carbon source, while
we find that knock-out of aup1 results in decreased viability of
cells in prolonged stationary phase incubation under sustained
gluconeogenic conditions.
this difference between aup1p and uth1p may reflect the
differences in experimental protocol, or they may reflect a com-
plex regulation of mitophagy through these proteins. intrigu-
ingly, uth1p is thought to be regulated by phosphorylation,3
raising the possibility that its function is regulated by aup1p.
although direct dephosphorylation of uth1p by aup1p is
unlikely since uth1p is projected to be localized at the cytoplas-
mic leaflet of the outer membrane (49) whereas aup1p is local-
ized to the intermembrane space (fig. 6), it is possible that
aup1p is part of a signal transduction network that relays a
signal from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasmic inter-
face and which then regulates mitochondrial targeting for
vacuolar degradation. further work on the possible interac-
tions between aup1p and uth1p are required to parse these
possibilities.
aup1p is a conserved protein with homologs in higher
eukaryotic cells—aup1p lacks clear paralogs in the yeast pro-
teome, despite the presence of a pp2c motif. aup1p appears to
be a unique yeast representative of a highly conserved yet pre-
viously unstudied eukaryotic pp1k family that is represented in
all the genomes sequenced and annotated to date. all of the
pp1k family members contain a pp2c motif and are predicted
to be mitochondrial. it remains to be seen whether the role of
aup1p in regulating mitophagy is evolutionarily conserved. in
any event the high degree of conservation between these pro-
teins, their apparently conserved mitochondrial localization,
and the lack of paralogs within the s. cerevisiae genome all
strongly suggest a conserved function. in addition, ruan et al.
(50)recentlyshowedthatrecombinantaup1haspp2c-typephos-

the relationship between aup1p function, atg1p function,
and mitophagy—while aup1p shows a synthetic interaction
with the atg1⌬880 allele, the mechanistic significance of this
interaction is unclear because we were unable to show a clear-
cut requirement for aup1p in classical starvation-induced mac-
roautophagy. nonetheless, it remains possible that a number of
signaling inputs impinge on atg1p, and that the atg1⌬880
mutant is defective for some of these inputs, leaving the auto-
phagic machinery dependent on aup1p signaling. an addi-
tional aspect of the relative roles of atg1p and aup1p is that
while aup1p appears to be completely required for degradation
ofaconitaseduringstationaryphaseinlactatemedium,atg1⌬cells
appear to be only partly defective in the degradation of aconitase
(fig. 4a). several different mechanisms have been proposed to
mediate mitophagy, including nonspecific macroautophagy (51),
specific macroautophagy (16), and specific microautophagy (52).
it is conceivable that the cell uses redundant pathways that are
activated by a common cue displayed on the mitochondrial sur-
face, and that aup1p is required for the generation of this signal.
further studies are required to test this hypothesis.
