autophagy is a major cellular process that facilitates the bulk degradation of eukaryotic
macromolecules and organelles, through degradation within the lysosomal/vacuole compartment.
this has been demonstrated to inﬂuence a diverse array of eukaryotic cell functions including
adaptation, differentiation and developmental programmes. for example, in saccharomyces
cerevisiae autophagy is required for sporulation and survival of nitrogen starvation. the
opportunistic pathogen candida albicans has the ability to colonize and cause disease within a
diverse range of mammalian host sites. the ability to adapt and differentiate within the host is liable
to be critical for host colonization and infection. previous results indicated that the vacuole plays an
important role in c. albicans adaptation to stress, differentiation, and survival within and injury of host
cells. in this study the importance of vacuole-mediated degradation through the process of
autophagy was investigated. this involved identiﬁcation and deletion of atg9, a c. albicans gene
required for autophagy. the deletion strain was blocked in autophagy and the closely related
cytoplasm to vacuole (cvt) trafﬁcking pathway. this resulted in sensitivity to nitrogen starvation, but
no defects in growth rate, vacuole morphology or resistance to other stresses. this indicates that
the mutant has speciﬁc defects in autophagy/cvt trafﬁcking. given the importance of autophagy in
the development and differentiation of other eukaryotes, it was surprising to ﬁnd that the atg9d
mutant was unaffected in either yeast–hypha or chlamydospore differentiation. furthermore, the
atg9d mutant survived within and killed a mouse macrophage-like cell line as efﬁciently as control
strains. the data suggest that autophagy plays little or no role in c. albicans differentiation or during
interaction with host cells.

introduction
autophagy is a major pathway by which eukaryotes are able
to degrade cellular material. this has been shown to
inﬂuence a wide array of biological phenomena including
resistance to stress and starvation, cellular differentiation,
development and ageing, programmed cell death, antigen
presentation, clearance of intracellular pathogens, tumor-
igenesis and neurodegenerative disease (mizushima, 2005).
in the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, autophagy
is critical
for survival during nitrogen starvation, and
to complete the differentiation process of sporulation
(takeshige et al., 1992; tsukada & ohsumi, 1993). the
molecular mechanism behind autophagy has been inten-
sively studied in yeast and mammalian cells, and many of the
components
required have been identiﬁed
(abeliovich & klionsky, 2001; klionsky, 2005). a portion
of cytoplasmic material is bound in a double-membrane
structure known as an autophagosome, which fuses with the
vacuolar membrane to release a single-membrane-bound
compartment within the vacuole lumen. degradation of this

material by the hydrolytic enzymes within the vacuole
recycles cellular building blocks such as amino acids, which
can be used in the synthesis of new macromolecules. thus
autophagy is typically considered a non-speciﬁc means
to degrade ‘bulk’ cytoplasmic material. however, recent
studies have revealed that under some conditions certain
cargo is preferentially targeted for sequestration within the
autophagosome (nair & klionsky, 2005). for example, in s.
cerevisiae under nutrient-replete conditions (i.e. when
autophagy is repressed), the vacuolar hydrolases amino-
peptidase i (api) and a-mannosidase (ams) are delivered
from cytoplasm to vacuole via the cvt (cytoplasm to vacuole
trafﬁcking) pathway. the cvt pathway closely resembles
autophagy, and involves sequestration of the cargo proteins
within a double-membrane vesicle, which subsequently
fuses to the vacuole to release its contents within the lumen.
the vesicles formed are smaller than autophagosomes and
appear to speciﬁcally deliver the api and ams hydrolases.
interestingly, the cvt and autophagy pathways rely on
much of the same cellular machinery, and many mutants
defective in autophagy are also blocked in the cvt pathway
(abeliovich & klionsky, 2001; thumm et al., 1994; tsukada
& ohsumi, 1993). furthermore, under starvation condi-
tions api and ams are delivered to the vacuole in the

is a commensal organism of
candida albicans
some
mammalian species including humans, where it commonly
resides on mucosal surfaces. under conditions of host
immunosuppression c. albicans can invade host tissues to
cause a diverse range of diseases. infection of mucosal
surfaces is common, with hiv patients being particularly
susceptible
(de
repentigny et al., 2004), while neutropenic patients are at
risk of disseminated disease, with a high mortality rate
(maertens et al., 2001).
to oral and oesophageal candidiasis
given the importance of autophagy in a diverse array of
eukaryotic cellular processes, we decided to establish the role
of autophagy in c. albicans survival and differentiation
within the host. to date the role the vacuole or indeed
autophagy plays during candida–host interaction has not
been established. we hypothesized that autophagy is
required for c. albicans adaptation and differentiation,
two properties critical for survival within and infection of
the mammalian host.
methods
sequence analysis. c. albicans atg9 and lap4 homologues were
identiﬁed through blastp searches on the c. albicans genome data-
base (http://www.candidagenome.org/) using the s. cerevisiae protein
sequences (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) as the query sequence.
protein sequences were aligned using the emboss pairwise align alo-
gorithm (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/). kyte–doolittle hydropathy
plots (kyte & doolittle, 1982) were performed within the ds gene
program (accelrys).
strain construction. strains used in this study are described in
table 1. gene deletion strains were constructed by the pcr-based
approach described by wilson et al. (1999), using the ura3 his1 arg4
strain bwp17, kindly provided by dr a. mitchell (columbia
university). atg9d : : arg4 and atg9d : : his1 deletion cassettes were
ampliﬁed by pcr using pargdspe and pgemhis1 plasmids,
respectively, as template with primers atg9disf and atg9disr
(table 2). bwp17 was ﬁrst transformed with atg9d : : arg4 to gen-
erate heterozygote strains baa1 and baa4. each heterozygote strain
was then transformed with the atg9d : : his1 cassette to generate the
double deletion strains baa1h1 and baa4h4. correct integration
of either cassette was conﬁrmed at each step by pcr analysis using
primer pairs atg9detf and atg9detr, atg9ampr and
arg4det2, or atg9ampf and his1f1268 (table 2). southern
blot analysis was also performed using an atg9-speciﬁc probe to
the 39-utr of atg9, ampliﬁed using primers atg9pbf and
atg9pbr (table 2). correct gene deletion resulted in the replace-
ment of 2858 bp of the 2859 bp atg9 orf, with either the 2822 nt
his1 or 2161 nt arg4 encoding cassettes. finally a wild-type copy
of atg9 including 59 and 39 ﬂanking sequences was introduced to
the deletion strains on pla2, to produce a prototrophic ‘reconsti-
tuted’ strain. prototrophic deletion strains were produced by trans-
forming the deletion strains with plasmid vector alone (plux).
either plasmid was digested with nhei prior to transformation to
target integration into (and reconstitution of) the ura3 loci. the
presence/absence of atg9 in the prototrophic deletion/reconstituted
strains was conﬁrmed by ampliﬁcation using the atg9detf/r
primer pair.
strains harbouring api–gfp fusions were derived from bwp17
(atg9/atg9), baa1 and baa4 (atg9/atg9d), and baa1h1 and
baa4h4 (atg9d/atg9d) using the pcr-based tagging approach
described by gerami-nejad et al. (2001). primers lap4gfpf and
lap4gfpr (table 2) were designed to amplify a gfp : : ura3 cassette
from plasmid pgfpura3 (gerami-nejad et al., 2001) with 78 bp of
homology on either end to direct integration at the 39 end of the c.
albicans lap41 gene to form an in-frame lap41–gfp fusion. the
ampliﬁed cassette was transformed into the above strains; transformant
colonies were selected, and screened for correct integration by pcr.
genomic dna was prepared from transformants and pcr-ampliﬁed
using primers lap4detr and ura3-5 (table 2); a product of 470 bp
conﬁrmed the expected integration event.
dna manipulations. pcr was performed using standard reagents.
plasmids pgemura3, pgemhis1 and prsargdspe (wilson et al.,
1999) were provided by dr a. mitchell (columbia university).
plasmid plux (ramon & fonzi, 2003), was provided by dr w.
fonzi (georgetown university). plasmids pla2 and pla9 were
made by amplifying the atg9 orf with 693 bp of 59-utr and
214 nt 39-utr from genomic dna with atg9ampf and
atg9ampr (table 2) to incorporate bamhi sites. the resulting
product was cloned into the bamhi site of plux.
growth conditions. strains were routinely grown on ypd (1 %
yeast extract, 2 % bacto peptone, 2 % glucose) at 30 uc, supple-
mented with uridine (25 mg ml21) when necessary (guthrie & fink,
1991). for growth curves, overnight cultures were subcultured to
20 ml fresh ypd medium to od600 0.2 and incubated at 30 uc with

transformants were selected on minimal media [6.75 g l21 yeast
nitrogen base plus ammonium sulfate and without amino acids, 2 %
glucose, 2 % bacto agar (ynb)] supplemented with the appropriate
auxotrophic requirements, as described for s. cerevisiae (burke et al.,
2000), except for uridine, which was added at 25 mg ml21.
phenotypic assays. resistance to temperature stress was deter-
mined on ypd agar at 37 and 42 uc, and osmotic stress on ypd
agar plus 2.5 m glycerol or 1.5 m nacl. secreted aspartyl protease
(sap) secretion was examined on bsa+ye agar (crandall &
edwards, 1987). carboxypeptidase y (cpy) activity was measured
using a colorimetric assay as previously reported (palmer et al.,
2003). resistance to nitrogen starvation was determined using an
assay similar to that of noda et al. (2000). each strain was grown in
ynb broth for 48 h at 30 uc. cells were washed twice in sd–n and
107 cells resuspended in 2 ml sd–n medium (0.17 % yeast nitrogen
base without ammonium sulfate or amino acids, 2 % glucose).
samples taken at intervals were plated to ypd agar, and viability
determined as c.f.u. after 2 days at 30 uc. accumulation of autopha-
gic bodies within the vacuole was assayed by transferring cells grown
overnight in ypd to sd–n medium in the presence of 1 mm pmsf
(noda et al., 2000). pmsf inhibits the breakdown of the delivered
autophagic bodies. after 6–24 h at 30 uc, cells were examined by dif-
ferential interference contrast (dic) microscopy. filamentation on
m199 and 10 % fetal calf serum (fcs) agar was performed as pre-
viously described (palmer & sturtevant, 2004). cells from overnight
cultures were also induced to ﬁlament in 10 % fcs (in distilled
h2o) at 37 uc after inoculation at 106 cells ml21. chlamydospores
were induced on cornstarch-tween agar as previously described
(palmer et al., 2004). sensitivity to h2o2 and rapamycin was deter-
mined by measuring growth in ypd medium supplemented with
the appropriate compound. approximately 1000 cells from an over-
night culture were inoculated to 200 ml growth medium within the
wells of a 96-well plate. after 48 h incubation at 30 uc (250 r.p.m.),
growth was measured at od600 using a plate reader.
phagocytic assays. the murine macrophage cell
line, j774a.1
(atcc tib-67) was grown according to attc instructions in d-
mem, high glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum at
37 uc under 5 % co2. the same culture conditions were used for
incubations with c. albicans. c. albicans strains were incubated with
j774a.1 cells as described by lorenz et al. (2004). brieﬂy, j774.a1
cells were seeded overnight in 12-well plates (26105 per well) on
18 mm coverslips and incubated at 37 uc under 5 % co2. c. albicans
strains were grown overnight at 30 uc, washed and incubated with
j774a.1 cells at an m.o.i. of 2.0 (46105 per well) unless otherwise
noted.
macrophage survival. c. albicans and j774a.1 cells were incubated
for 1, 5 and 24 h and then wells were washed and incubated with
0.2 mm calcein am (ﬁnal concentration) (live/dead viability/
cytotoxicity kit, molecular probes). c. albicans cells were simulta-
(0.225 mm). coverslips were
neously
removed from wells and observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope.
macrophages that ﬂuoresced green were viable. macrophage survival
was quantiﬁed by counting at least four ﬁelds for each well. results
are presented as the mean number of macrophages observed per
ﬁeld.

c. albicans survival. this was assessed using an end-point dilution
assay as described by rocha et al. (2001). macrophages were seeded
overnight in 96-well plates at 56103 per well. c. albicans (50 ml)
were added to the ﬁrst column of cells (150 ml), then serially diluted
1 : 4 for six columns so that the resulting m.o.i. were between 2 and
1.961023. the plates were incubated for 48 h. controls were wells
with c. albicans but no macrophages. the lowest dilution of the
control well where it was possible to discriminate distinct colonies
was counted. the same dilution was counted for the c. albicans plus
macrophage well. results are presented as (number of colonies in
the presence of macrophages/number of colonies in the absence of
macrophages)6100. each experiment was set up in quadruplicate
and p values determined using the unpaired student’s t-test.

vacuole morphology and api localization. vacuole morphol-
ogy was visualized using the ﬂuorescent dye fm4-64, as reported
(palmer et al., 2003; vida & emr, 1995). in order to localize the
api–gfp fusion protein, cells were grown into the exponential
phase in ypd medium, stained with fm4-64, washed twice in dis-
tilled water, and visualized using an olympus bx51 ﬂuorescence
microscope. all cells were applied to polylysine-coated slides prior
to viewing.
western blot analysis. western blot analysis was performed basi-
cally as described previously (palmer & sturtevant, 2004). cell
extracts of c. albicans were prepared by lysis with glass beads in the
presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (sigma). lysates were
microfuged at 13 000 r.p.m. to yield supernatant and pellet fractions.
the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml sds-page sample buffer.
protein lysates (pellet and supernatant fractions) prepared from
equivalent numbers of cells were loaded per lane in 12 % sds-page
gels. gels were transferred to protran (schleicher and schuell)
and blotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-gfp antibody (anaspec).
equivalent loading of sds-page gels was conﬁrmed by staining
with coomassie blue, and membranes were stained with ponceau
red (sigma) following the manufacturer’s directions. a horseradish-
peroxidase-conjugated
antibody
(rockland) was used for detection with reagents supplied by pierce.

cloning and deletion of c. albicans atg9
s. cerevisiae atg9 (also known as cvt7 and apg9) encodes
an integral membrane protein of 998 amino acids, which is
required for autophagosome and cvt vesicle formation
(lang et al., 2000; noda et al., 2000). deletion of atg9
results in complete abrogation of autophagy and cvt
pathways, leading to a block in api and ams delivery,
sensitivity to nitrogen starvation and an inability to
complete sporulation (lang et al., 2000; noda et al.,
2000). blast searches to the c. albicans genome sequence
database (www.candidagenome.org/) identiﬁed a single
atg9 orthologue, predicted to encode a protein of
952 amino acids,
sharing 32 % identity and 47.6 %
similarity with s. cerevisiae atg9p. a kyte–doolittle plot
of the predicted c. albicans atg9p sequence suggests six to
eight transmembrane domains, which is in good agreement
with the ﬁve to eight predicted transmembrane domains of
the s. cerevisiae protein (lang et al., 2000; noda et al., 2000).
in order to investigate the importance of autophagy (and the
related cvt pathway) in the pathogen c. albicans, we
constructed a strain in which both atg9 alleles were
deleted. correct genotype was checked by both pcr
detection and southern blot analysis. the deletion mutant
was readily produced,
indicating that this gene is not
essential for viability. a wild-type copy of atg9 including 59
and 39 ﬂanking sequences was then reintroduced to the
deletion strain to produce a ‘reconstituted’ strain.
the atg9d mutant had a growth rate comparable to wild-
type and reconstituted strains in liquid ypd culture, and
was not sensitive to osmotic, temperature or oxidative
stresses (data not shown). levels of vacuolar cpy activity
were also determined to be comparable between mutant and
control strains, suggesting that trafﬁcking from the golgi
apparatus to the vacuole was not affected in the atg9d
mutant (data not shown), and the mutant strain was
unaffected in sap activity (data not shown). the mutant
strain was not sensitive to the autophagy-inducing drug
rapamycin, or the replication checkpoint inhibitor caffeine
(data not shown). vacuole morphology was analysed using
the ﬂuorescent dye fm4-64 (vida & emr, 1995). the atg9d
mutant was observed to have an intact vacuole morphology,
control strains (data not shown).
similar to that of atg9
c. albicans atg9d is defective in autophagy
we examined resistance to nitrogen starvation by measuring
viability (as c.f.u.) after transfer to medium lacking a
nitrogen source (sd–n) (fig. 1a). wild-type and recon-
stituted strains underwent two to three further cell divisions
after shifting to sd–n medium, and then maintained
viability for the duration of the experiment (30 days).
however, the atg9d strain did not continue to divide after
the shift to sd–n and c.f.u. steadily declined to 0, clearly
demonstrating that atg9d cells are sensitive to nitrogen

starvation. we next induced the formation of autophago-
somes in sd–n media containing 1 mm pmsf. pmsf is a
serine protease inhibitor which blocks the action of vacuolar
prb, an enzyme required for degradation of autophagic
bodies within the vacuole (noda et al., 2000). under these
conditions wild-type and atg9 reconstituted strains
accumulate autophagic bodies within the vacuole, giving
the vacuole a granular appearance (fig. 1b). as expected,
the atg9d strain did not accumulate autophagic bodies
under these conditions, conﬁrming that our atg9d mutant is
defective at an early step of autophagy, possibly autophago-
some formation.
c. albicans atg9d is defective in cvt trafﬁcking
in order to establish if atg9p functions in the cytoplasm to
vacuole trafﬁcking pathway, we tagged the cvt cargo protein
api (encoded by the lap4 gene in s. cerevisiae). using the s.
cerevisiae lap4p sequence we identiﬁed two lap4-like
orfs, designated lap4 and lap41 by the c. albicans
genome database. the predicted amino acid sequences had
57 % (lap41p) and 34 % (lap4p) identity to s. cerevisiae
lap4p. we therefore selected the lap41 orf for gfp
tagging using a pcr-based procedure (gerami-nejad et al.,
2001), to generate a c-terminal lap41–gfp fusion,
in
and atg9d backgrounds. tagged strains were grown
atg9
under nutrient-replete conditions (ypd) to the exponential
phase of growth, conditions where cvt trafﬁcking occurs but
not autophagy, and observed by ﬂuorescent microscopy
cells had ﬂuorescence in three distinct
(fig. 2a). atg9
patterns: 1, single intense spot outside the vacuole; 2, single
intense spot within vacuole lumen; 3, diffuse staining of the
vacuole lumen. these patterns resemble api–gfp localiza-
tion in s. cerevisiae (suzuki et al., 2002) and correspond
nicely with the cvt trafﬁcking events: 1, oligomerized api–
gfp precursor within the cytoplasm, or the membrane-
bound cvt vesicle prior to vacuolar delivery; 2, cvt body
released into the vacuole; 3, mature api–gfp released into
the vacuole lumen following degradation of cvt vesicle
(wang & klionsky, 2003). the distribution of api–gfp in
the atg9d background mutant was altered (table 3). no
diffuse staining of the vacuole lumen was detected, and an
increased proportion of cells had a single spot distribution.
furthermore, the spots were of increased intensity in the
atg9d mutant as compared to the atg9
control strains,
suggesting an accumulation of api–gfp in the oligomeric
cytoplasmic cvt complex.
in s. cerevisiae, api is synthesized as an inactive precursor,
which is activated upon delivery to the vacuole by
proteolytic cleavage of an n-terminal propeptide of
45 amino acids (oda et al., 1996). this can be followed as
a shift in molecular mass on a western blot (klionsky et al.,
1992; suzuki et al., 2002). in order to further conﬁrm the cvt
trafﬁcking defects, we immunodetected the api–gfp fusion
and atg9d backgrounds, using a
protein in atg9
polyclonal anti-gfp antibody. the predicted molecular
mass of gfp is 26.9 kda and that of c. albicans lap41p
56.7 kda (prior to proteolytic maturation). in atg9

detected a non-speciﬁc band of around 25 kda, and one of
approximately 80 kda (atg9d only), which corresponded with
the expected molecular mass of lap41–gfp. two indepen-
dently constructed gfp-tagged strains were analysed for each
genotype, and both experiments repeated three times. strain

strains, delivery of api–gfp to the vacuole would expose the
gfp tag to the proteolytically active vacuole lumen, which is
liable to have resulted in its cleavage and/or degradation.
this may account for the inability to detect the api–gfp
fusion species by western blotting (fig. 2b), and the fairly
low level of ﬂuorescence detected within the vacuole lumen.
unfortunately the anti-gfp antibody recognized a peptide

around 25 kda. a similar non-speciﬁc band has been
described in s. cerevisiae (suzuki et al., 2002) and may have
obscured the detection of peptide species of a similar size,
including any gfp that is cleaved upon vacuolar delivery.
however, a species of 75–80 kda, corresponding to the
predicted api–gfp molecular mass was detected in the
atg9d background, indicating accumulation of api–gfp in
the atg9d mutant. this species was detected in the pelletable
fraction of the cell extracts, but not the soluble fraction. this
suggests that the api–gfp has accumulated as part of a large
complex before vacuole delivery, perhaps either the highly
oligomerized precursor api (cvt body), or even within a cvt
vesicle (yorimitsu & klionsky, 2005). these data clearly
demonstrated that, similar to the s. cerevisiae atg9d mutant,
our c. albicans atg9d mutant has a defect in cvt trafﬁcking to
the vacuole.
autophagy is not required for c. albicans
differentiation
in the model eukaryote s. cerevisiae, mutants defective in
autophagy are unable to complete sporulation (takeshige
et al., 1992; tsukada & ohsumi, 1993). moreover,
autophagy has been intimately associated with a wide
range of differentiation and development events in higher
eukaryotes. we therefore assessed the consequences of a
defect in autophagy on two major differentiation processes
of c. albicans. yeast–hypha differentiation was examined on
solid and in liquid m199 and fcs media. in each case the
atg9d mutant produced ﬁlaments that were indistinguish-
control strains (data not shown),
able from the atg9
indicating that under in vitro conditions autophagy is not
essential for yeast–hypha differentiation. similarly, when
the atg9d mutant
induced on cornstarch-tween agar,
produced chlamydospores with similar kinetics and abun-
control strains (data not shown).
dance as the atg9
together these results suggest that autophagy is not required
for two major differentiation events in c. albicans.
autophagy is not required for c. albicans
survival within or killing of a macrophage cell
line
previous studies using two c. albicans mutants with defects
in vacuole biogenesis demonstrated that some vacuolar
function(s) are required for survival within, and killing of a
mouse macrophage-like cell line (j774a.1) (palmer et al.,
2005). we considered that while not required for yeast–
hypha differentiation or chlamydospore formation, autop-
hagy may be important for normal interaction with host
cells or survival within host tissues. to test this we analysed
the outcome of atg9d interaction with the j774a.1 cell line,
by determining macrophage and c. albicans survival rates.
following co-culture, the macrophages rapidly phagocy-
tosed wild-type c. albicans. this was followed by ﬁlamenta-
tion of c. albicans within the macrophage, which resulted in
stretching of the j774a.1 cells, followed by macrophage lysis.
the atg9d mutant killed the j774a.1 cells as efﬁciently as
strains (data not shown), indicating that autophagy
atg9
is not required for killing of the macrophage cell line. c.
albicans survival of the macrophage challenge was deter-
mined using an end-point dilution assay (rocha et al.,
2001). we found that the atg9d cells exhibited similar
control
susceptibility to the j774a.1 interaction as atg9
strains (data not shown), indicating that this pathway does
not aid c. albicans survival within the j774a.1 cells.
discussion
autophagy is a well-conserved pathway in eukaryotes, and
serves to facilitate a diverse range of cellular activities. in this
study we investigated the importance of autophagy and
the closely related cvt pathway during differentiation
and pathogenesis of the fungal pathogen c. albicans. we
hypothesized that autophagy may be an important
mechanism for survival and/or differentiation within host
tissues. we considered that during adaptation to new host
environments c. albicans may need to recycle endogenous
macromolecules to provide nutrients until host sources can
be tapped, or that in order to facilitate rapid differentiation
within the host an ‘elimination’ of inappropriately expressed
proteins may occur via autophagic degradation. we
addressed these questions by analysing a mutant strain
defective in autophagy. as expected, the atg9d mutant strain
constructed within this study was blocked in autophagy and
the closely related cvt pathway, and was sensitive to nitrogen
starvation. however, the atg9d mutant had a normal growth
rate, vacuolar cpy activity, resistance to osmotic and
temperature stress, and vacuole morphology. these ﬁndings

suggest that the atg9d mutant does not have a generalized
defect in vacuolar function (palmer et al., 2005), but a
speciﬁc defect in cvt/autophagy trafﬁcking.
for
survival
the atg9d mutant has no detectable defect
in either
chlamydospore or yeast–hypha differentiation, a result
which was surprising given the importance of this pathway
in a diverse array of eukaryotic biological processes, includ-
ing s. cerevisiae sporulation. microarray studies by lorenz
et al. (2004) demonstrated that upon phagocytosis by
j774a.1 cells, c. albicans undergoes a starvation-like tran-
scriptional response, suggesting that the phagolysosome is
a nutritionally poor environment. vacuolar proteases
including api, cpy and prb are upregulated following
macrophage ingestion, suggesting that vacuole-mediated
proteolysis may be important
following
phagocytosis. however, our atg9d mutant was not deﬁcient
in its ability to survive within or kill a mouse macrophage-
like cell line, suggesting that autophagy may not be required
for c. albicans–macrophage interaction. this prompted us
to conduct a small-scale pilot study to test the virulence of
the atg9d mutant in the well-deﬁned mouse model of
haematogenously disseminated candidiasis. only three mice
were infected per c. albicans strain, but our results (mean
survival time and fungal burden in the kidneys) clearly
suggested that the atg9d mutant is fully virulent (data not
shown). taken together, these results indicate that autop-
hagy plays little or no role in c. albicans differentiation
or pathogenesis. it remains possible that autophagy is
important for the long-term survival of c. albicans as a
commensal organism, or to reside on a peripheral host site
such as skin, or perhaps within the environment.
previously we found a c. albicans vps11d mutant to be
defective in vacuole biogenesis and to exhibit a range of
pleiotropic phenotypes, including a reduced growth rate,
sensitivity to a range of stresses and to nitrogen starvation,
and reduced vacuolar and secreted protease activities
(palmer et al., 2003, 2005). moreover, this mutant is
unable to undergo yeast–hypha differentiation and was
unable to kill the j774a.1 macrophage cell line. work with a
partially functional vps11 allele revealed that restoring a
normal growth rate, stress resistance, and sap and vacuolar
hydrolase activities was not sufﬁcient to restore normal
ﬁlamentation or macrophage killing. both vps11 mutants
have highly fragmented vacuole morphology and are
sensitive to nitrogen starvation, suggesting either of these
vacuolar functions to be important in yeast–hypha differ-
entiation and macrophage killing. as outlined above, the
major role of the vacuole during nitrogen starvation is
through the process of autophagy. the results presented
here clearly demonstrate that vacuolar functions relating to
autophagy are of little consequence in either yeast–hypha
differentiation or interaction with macrophages.
gow & gooday (1982, 1984) originally observed the vacuole
to undergo a dynamic expansion during c. albicans germ-
tube emergence from a parental yeast cell. furthermore,
during apical extension of the germ-tube, asymmetrical
candida albicans autophagy
division of the protoplasm yields subapical compartments
composed almost entirely of vacuole, whereas the proto-
plasm migrates at the hyphal tip (barelle et al., 2003; gow
& gooday, 1984). after a delay, the highly vacuolated
compartments regenerate cytoplasm and the vacuoles
recede. this pattern of vacuole inheritance also seems to
inﬂuence cell cycle progression and branching frequency of
the hyphae (barelle et al., 2003; veses et al., 2005). at present
the mechanism by which vacuole expansion is mediated,
and its importance during host interaction, are unknown.
our results further strengthen the hypothesis that the major
role the vacuole plays in yeast–hypha differentiation relates
to its morphology, and perhaps its physical expansion to
generate ‘empty’ hyphal compartments. moreover, our
results eliminate the autophagic and cvt trafﬁcking pathways
as mediating germ-tube induced vacuole expansion.
