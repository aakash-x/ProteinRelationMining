abstract
lysosomes are responsible for the degradation of macromolecules derived from the cell exterior by endocy-
tosis, or from within the cell by autophagy. while our knowledge of the biosynthesis and targeting of lysoso-
mal hydrolases is considerable, much less is known about the lysosomal membrane itself. to identify the lyso-
somal membrane proteins that mediate these functions, we have isolated lysosomes from amebae and injected
them  into  mice  to  produce  monoclonal  antibodies  (mabs).  we  produced  nine  mabs  against  dictyostelium
lysosomes  from  the  batches  of  fused  cells.  among  them,  three  mabs  were  specific  to  lysosomal  membrane
and  gave  a  strong  signal,  and  thus  used  in  this  study.  the  mabs  specifically  reacted  with  a  single  protein
band of 27 kd and stained a lysosome-like structure by immunofluorescence microscopy. to identify the anti-
gen that the mabs recognize, we processed differential centrifugation with whole-cell extract of dictyostelium
and traced p27 protein by activity assay of organelle marker enzyme. we showed that p27 is one component
of the lysosomal system on the basis of comigration with a lysosomal marker enzyme. we also demonstrated
that the 27-kd lysosomal protein is a tightly bound integral membrane protein by using a phase separation
method of triton x-114.
introduction
lysosomes serve as digestive organelles in eukaryotic cells.
the hydrolytic enzymes within the lysosomes are respon-
sible for the degradation of macromolecules derived from the
cell  exterior  by  endocytosis,  or  from  within  the  cell  by  au-
tophagy. while our knowledge of the biosynthesis and target-
ing  of  lysosomal  hydrolases  is  considerable,(1) much  less  is
known about the lysosomal membrane itself.(2) the lysosomal
membrane  is  unique  in  several  aspects.  the  lysosomal  mem-
brane is critical for maintenance of cell homeostasis because it
provides  the  communication  link  between  the  degradative  lo-
cation of the lysosome and the cytosol.(3) in addition, the lyso-
somal  membrane  plays  a  role  in  resistance  to  degradation  by
the  hydrolases  it  delimits,  specific  fusion  with  other  cellular
membranes, maintenance of a low intraorganellar ph, and spe-
cific export of hydrolase digestion products.(4,5)
dictyostelium can be maintained on a culture plate with bac-
teria lawn and the free-living amebae feed upon bacteria by phago-
cytosis.(6) when grown axenically, amebae take up rich media by
fluid  phase  endocytosis.  thus,  dictyostelium  amebae  possess  a
well-developed  lysosomal  system  involved  in  endocytosis  and
food digestion.(7) many of the genes encoding lysosomal enzymes
are  regulated  during  growth  and  development,  and  because  the
organism  is  easily  manipulated  both  biochemically  and  geneti-
cally, dictyostelium discoideum presents a unique system in which
to investigate the function of the lysosomes and the proteins that
constitute the lysosomal membrane.(8,9) aside from well-known
lysosomal membrane proteins, i.e., the lamps and limps, it can
be predicted from physiologic uptake and flux studies that multi-
ple classes of transporter proteins exist.(10) as an initial approach
to learn about the proteins that mediate these functions, we have
isolated lysosomes from the amebae and injected them into mice
to produce monoclonal antibodies (mabs). using the antibodies
as probes, we identified and characterized a lysosomal membrane
protein.

materials and methods
dictyostelium discoideum
basic stock culture of the axenic d. discoideum strain, ax-
2, was maintained on lawns of enterobacter aerogens. for ax-
enic  growth,  cells  were  cultivated  in  hl5  medium  (15.4  g 
glucose,  14.3  g  neutralized  bacteriologic  peptone  [oxoid,
hampshire,  uk],  7.0  g  yeast  extract  [oxoid],  0.96  g
na2hpo47h2o,  and  0.49  g  k2h2po4 per  liter  of  deionized
h2o,  ph  6.8)  and  the  cultures  were  shaken  at  100  rpm  at
22°c.(11) exponentially growing cells at a density of 2–4 ⫻ 106
cells/ml were passaged by an approximately 100-fold dilution
into fresh hl5 medium.
isolation of lysosomes
the  cells  were  collected  by  centrifugation  for  1  minute  at
900 g. an equal volume of homogenizing buffer (20 mm tris-
hcl,  ph  7.2,  10%  sucrose,  and  1  mm  phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride) was added to 5 ml packed cells, and the cells were
lysed in a potter-elvehjem glass homogenizer until 90% of cells
were broken (determined under the microscope). the lysate was
placed  onto  the  top  of  10%–50%  linear  percoll  gradient  in  a
30-ml tube and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 g at 4°c.
one-milliliter  fractions  were  collected  from  the  top  while  su-
crose solution was being injected into the bottom of the tube.
fractions  showing  high  lysosomal  marker-enzyme  activities
were  combined,  diluted  five  times  with  the  homogenizing
buffer, and the tube was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 15,000 g
to collect lysosomes.
enzyme assay
the  lysosomal  marker  enzyme,  acid  phosphatase,  was  as-
sayed as previously described with a modification.(12) percoll
gradient fractions (100 ␮l each) were added to 0.3 ml of sub-
strate solution containing 5 mm sodium acetate buffer (ph 5.0),
0.2% triton x-100, and 5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate. after
30 minutes at 37°c, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml
of 0.5 m glycine and 0.5 m sodium carbonate (ph 10). succi-
nate  dehydrogenase,  a  mitochondrial  marker,  was  assayed  as
described below. the fractions of percoll gradient were incu-
bated for 15 minutes at 37°c with gentle shaking in 0.5 ml (fi-
nal volume) of the following medium: 50 mm potassium phos-
phate  buffer  (ph  7.4)  containing  0.1%  2-p-iodo-phenyl-3-p-
nitrophenyl-5-phenyl-tetrazolium chloride, and 25 mm sucrose.
then,  0.5  ml  of  10%  trichloroacetic  acid  was  added  and  the
formazan was extracted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. after stand-
ing for 5 minutes under a hood, 1 ml of the extract was taken
from the top and absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
production of mabs
isolated  lysosomes  were  fixed  for  30  min  in  3%  parafor-
maldehyde and 10% sucrose in 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4) and
washed  3  times  in  phosphate-buffered  saline  (pbs)  by  cen-
trifugation  for  5  minutes  at  10,000  g.  fixed  lysosomes  were
suspended in pbs and 0.5 ml of the suspension was then in-
jected intraperitoneally into a mouse (6–8 weeks old, balb/c
female) without the adjuvant. the first injection was followed
by three booster injections at 3- to 4-week intervals, and the fi-
nal injection was given 3 or 4 days before the cell fusion. spleen
cells were prepared by rearing with forceps, fused with sp2/0-
ag14 myeloma cells, and placed in 96-well plates. hybridoma
cells producing antibodies were primarily screened by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and were cloned by lim-
iting dilution.
elisa
for  the  screening  of  mabs,  96-well  microtiter  plates  were
incubated  with  50  ␮l  of  the  antigen  (2  ␮g/ml)  overnight  at
4°c.  after  washing  with  pbs-tween  20  (pbst)  extensively,
the plates were treated with culture supernatant for 1 hour, and
then for additional 1-hour incubation with horseradish peroxi-
dase  (hrp)-conjugated  goat  anti-mouse  immunoglobulin  g
(igg).  following  the  final  rinse  with  pbs,  the  color  reaction
was initiated by adding 50 ␮l of tmb substrate solution (kem
en  tec,  copenhagen,  denmark)  and  stopped  by  adding  10
mm h2so4. after the final washing with pbst, the absorbance
was read at 450 nm.
immunofluorescence microscopy
immunostaining of ameba was performed by the agar-over-
lay technique as described previously.(13) briefly, a thin agarose
sheet was prepared and laid over the cells before fixation, and
immunofluorescence  staining  proceeded  under  this  condition.
cells  were  harvested  and  suspended  in  the  phosphate  buffer,
and an aliquot of the suspension was placed on a coverslip. a
thin agarose sheet dissolved in the phosphate buffer was put on
the cells. then, the coverslip was immersed in ⫺20°c metha-
nol and fixed for 5 minutes. after a brief rinse with pbs, the
samples were incubated with the mabs for 30 minutes at 37°c,
washed in changed pbs three times at 5-minute intervals, and
further processed with the goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated
to  fluorescein  isothiocyanate  (fitc)  for  30  minutes.  the  la-
beled cells were washed extensively with pbs, mounted with
a mounting solution containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine
and  10%  pbs,  and  examined  under  a  fluorescence  micro-
scope.(14)
western blotting
for western blotting, the proteins separated by 12% sodium
dodecyl  sulfate–polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (sds-
page) were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.(15) the
membranes  were  blocked  with  5%  non-fat  dry  milk  in  tris-
buffered saline (tbs) and incubated with the primary antibody
for 1 hour. hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was used
as  a  probe  to  detect  the  primary  antibody.  after  rinsing  with
tbst thoroughly, chemiluminescence reaction was started ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instruction (pierce, rockford, il).
protein concentration was determined according to bradford as-
say (1976).
affinity purification of p27
mab (lys-47 clone) was purified from mouse ascitic flu-
ids for the preparation of antibody affinity column. the ascitic
fluids were centrifuged to remove cell debris for 30 minutes at
12,000 g and the supernatant was then applied to the protein a

column. the antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-hcl (ph
2.5), neutralized with 1.0 m tris buffer (ph 8.0), and dialyzed
against  pbs  overnight.  the  purified  mab  was  coupled  to
cyanogen  bromide  (cnbr)-activated  sepharose  4b  for  24
hours. the column was blocked with 0.2 m glycine ethyl ester
(ph 8.0) for 2 hours, washed sequentially with pbs, 1 m mgcl2,
tbs buffer (25 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid  [edta],  ph  7.4),  and  stored  in  tbs  containing  0.1%
thimerosal. the antibody-coupled sepharose beads were rotated
overnight with whole ameba extract in a lysis buffer (20 mm
tris-hcl, 0.5% triton x-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, ph 7.2) and washed 1 m nacl in tbs. the high-affin-
ity bound proteins were eluted with 4 m mgcl2, 70 mm tris-
hcl (ph 7.5) and collected with equivalent volumes of 10 mm
tris-hcl  (ph  7.5).  fractions  containing  affinity-purified  pro-
teins were pooled and repeatedly diluted with 10 mm tris-hcl
(ph 7.5).
phase separation with triton x-114
lysosomal components were separated into hydrophobic and
hydrophilic fractions using the triton x-114 (sigma chemical,
st.  louis,  mo)  partitioning  method  of  bordier.(16) triton  x-
114 was added to give a final concentration of 1% (wt/vol), and
lysosomes  were  solubilized  for  30  minutes  at  4°c.  insoluble
components were removed by centrifugation at 4°c for 5 min-
utes at 13,000 g, and the triton x-114-solubilized material was
placed in a centrifuge tube and incubated for 5 minutes at 37°c
to induce rapid condensation of the triton x-114. the cloudy
suspension was centrifuged at 22°c for 5 minutes at 13,000 g.
the resulting upper (aqueous) phase was carefully transferred
to a second tube and brought to 1% triton x-114 by the addi-
tion of condensed triton x-114, whereas the lower phase was
brought to the original volume with pbs. both 1% triton x-
114  suspensions  were  then  dissolved  by  incubation  at  0°c  to
4°c for 15 minutes, and phase partitioning was repeated to ob-
tain fractions of the desired purity.
results and discussion
to  characterize  lysosomal  membrane  proteins,  we  need  to
purify the membrane proteins from the cells by column chro-
matography or other biochemical methods. however, intrinsic
properties of membrane proteins, such as poor solubility, ren-
der it difficult to isolate and identify the proteins. one of the
alternative approaches is to use antibodies as probe to identify
and characterize the membrane proteins. for the production of
mabs  against  dictyostelium  lysosomes,  we  injected  isolated
lysosomes  into  mice  without  adjuvant  after  fixing  with
formaldehyde.  from  the  batches  of  fused  cells,  we  obtained
nine mabs by elisa screening. because goat anti-mouse igg
antibody was used as a secondary antibody for the selection of
mabs, all the mabs selected by the procedure were igg classes.
to identify the antigen that the mabs recognize, lysosomal pro-
teins  were  extracted,  separated  by  sds-page,  and  im-
munoblotted with the mabs. initially, we expected to produce
a large number of mabs that recognize different lysosomal pro-
teins in western blot. instead, most of the mabs were cross-
reacted  with  a  single  protein  band  of  27  kd  (p27)  from  lyso-
some vesicle extract (fig. 1a). this observation indicates that
the p27 lysosomal protein may be highly immunogenic. among
them, we chose three mabs (lys-46, lys-47, lys-98) for use
in  the  present  study  on  the  basis  of  strong  reactivity  in  im-
munoblotting.
to check whether the mabs recognize a lysosome-like struc-
ture, the cells were stained with the antibody for the immuno-
fluorescence  microscopy.  dictyostelium  amebae  are  not  flat
enough to allow light microscopic observation of their cellular
structures. so, we adapted an agar overlay technique for the im-

of the cell pressed the cell down flat for a better resolution. as
expected,  the  mabs  recognized  numerous  numbers  of  small
vesicles throughout the cytoplasm, which appeared to be lyso-
some-like organelles (fig. 1b).
to  show  further  that  the  27-kd  protein  recognized  by  the
mabs is one component of the lysosomal system, we checked
whether the protein comigrated with a lysosomal marker dur-
ing differential centrifugation. we disrupted the cell and sepa-
rated the ameba homogenate on a percoll gradient. each frac-
tion was collected and tested for the lysosomal marker enzyme

high-broad peak in figure 2b. the profile of enzymatic activ-
ity  corresponded  well  to  the  peak  representing  the  amount  of
p27 in fraction, which was scored by intensity of mab-recog-
nizing band (fig. 2c and 2d). this observation suggests that
the lysosomal marker enzyme and the 27-kd protein band are
found in the same fractions, and the mab-stained p27 band is
a  component  of  the  lysosomal  system.  thus,  these  results  to-
gether with those of western blot and immunofluorescence mi-
croscopy indicate that the mabs we generated are specific and
bind to p27 of the lysosomal protein in dictyostelium ameba.
at higher magnification, the mabs appeared to stain the pe-
riphery of lysosomal vesicles, suggesting that the 27-kd protein
is  a  membrane  protein  (data  not  shown).  to  test  whether  the
27-kd protein is a membrane-bound protein, we extracted the
lysosomal fractions from percoll gradient with triton x-114.(16)
the location of 27-kd protein was traced by application of both
western  blot  and  a  detergent  phase  partitioning  system  using
triton  x-114  (fig.  3).  after  separation,  each  phase  was  ana-
lyzed by western blot for the presence of the p27 protein. while
no protein band was detected in the soluble phase when probed
with mab lys-47, the detergent phase contained the p27 pro-
tein. the selective segregation of hydrophobic proteins by their
ability to form detergent micelles in this system enabled a rapid
identification of the p27 protein as a tightly bound membrane
protein. considering a large amount of p27 was still detectable
in the pellet, it suggested that p27 could be an integral mem-
brane  protein  on  lysosome  of  dictyostelium.  detergent  phase
partitioning  has  gained  wide  acceptance  in  selectively  frac-
tionating proteins associated with a number of membrane sys-
tems.(17)
to identify the p27 protein, we purified the protein by anti-
body affinity chromatography. detergent-treated cell lysate was
applied on the mab lys-47-coupled sepharose 4b column and
bound proteins were eluted with high salt solution. when the
eluted  protein  sample  was  checked  by  sds-page  and  com-
massie blue-stained, two protein bands were detected as shown
in the lane of purified protein fraction of figure 4a. to check
whether the smaller band is a proteolytic fragment of p27, the
two protein bands were tested by western blot but three mabs
against p27 protein did not recognize the smaller 25-kd protein
band,  indicating  that  p25  protein  can  be  a  different  molecule
from p27. one plausible explanation is that the two proteins of
p27 and p25 do interact in the lysosomal membrane. because
the band intensity of the proteins are quite similar, the two pro-
teins could bind to each other and form a complex as a 1:1 mo-
lar ratio. for further identification, both protein bands were cut,
eluted,  and  sent  to  a  protein  sequencing  laboratory.  unfortu-
nately,  n-terminal  amino  acid  sequencing  could  not  be
processed because n-termini of the two proteins were blocked.
dictyostelium’s lysosomes were first isolated and charac-
terized by magnetic fractionation.(18) cells were fed with iron
oxide  and  a  lysosome  fraction  was  isolated  magnetically.
later, lysosomal membrane proteins were characterized after
preparation by a similar method.(8) after stripping the mem-
brane with salt, they found that 25 glycoproteins were detected
by lectin blot analysis. on the blot, a prominent glycoprotein
band was detected in the range of 27–30 kd. recently, a pro-
teomic study on lysosomal membrane proteins identified 215
proteins that have been previously associated with lysosomes
and endosomes.(19) they found that the high degree of diver-
sity  of  the  proteins  of  the  lysosomal  membrane  was  indica-
tive of a highly complex organelle. one way to identify p27
protein is to perform a proteomic analysis of lysosomal pro-
teins  after  purification  from  dictyostelium  ameba.  although
the rat proteomic database may not match exactly, the com-
parison  study  could  provide  a  clue  to  identify  the  nature  of
the p27 protein.
