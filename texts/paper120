the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl bind and inhibit
beclin-1, an essential mediator of autophagy. here, we
demonstrate that this interaction involves a bh3 domain
within beclin-1 (residues 114–123). the physical interaction
between beclin-1 and bcl-xl is lost when the bh3 domain of
beclin-1 or the bh3 receptor domain of bcl-xl is mutated.
mutation of the bh3 domain of beclin-1 or of the bh3
receptor domain of bcl-xl abolishes the bcl-xl-mediated
inhibition of autophagy triggered by beclin-1. the pharma-
cological bh3 mimetic abt737 competitively inhibits the
interaction between beclin-1 and bcl-2/bcl-xl, antagonizes
autophagy inhibition by bcl-2/bcl-xl and hence stimulates
autophagy. knockout or knockdown of the bh3-only protein
bad reduces starvation-induced autophagy, whereas bad
overexpression induces autophagy in human cells. gain-of-
function mutation of
the sole bh3-only protein from
caenorhabditis elegans, egl-1, induces autophagy, while
deletion of egl-1 compromises starvation-induced autop-
hagy. these results reveal a novel autophagy-stimulatory
function of bh3-only proteins beyond their established role
as apoptosis inducers. bh3-only proteins and pharmacologi-
cal bh3 mimetics induce autophagy by competitively dis-
rupting the interaction between beclin-1 and bcl-2 or bcl-xl.

introduction
two self-destructive processes, apoptosis (self-killing) and
autophagy (self-eating), have captured the attention of cell
biologists over the last decades. while apoptosis involves the
activation of catabolic enzymes leading to the demolition of
cellular structures and organelles, autophagy is a slow,
localized phenomenon in which parts of the cytoplasm are
sequestered within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles
and ﬁnally digested by lysosomal hydrolases (gozuacik and
kimchi, 2004; kroemer and jaattela, 2005). the relationship
between apoptosis and autophagy is complex and autophagy
may either contribute to cell death (shimizu et al, 2004; yu
et al, 2004) or constitute a cellular defense against acute
stress, in particular stress induced by starvation from nutri-
ents or obligate growth factors (boya et al, 2005; lum et al,
2005). the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is
mediated at least in part by the functional and physical
interaction between beclin-1, an essential autophagy gene,
and bcl-2, one of the paradigmatic apoptosis-inhibitory pro-
teins (liang et al, 1999; pattingre et al, 2005; takacs-vellai
et al, 2005).
bcl-2 is the prototype of a family of proteins containing at
least one bcl-2 homology (bh) region. the family is split into
anti-apoptotic multidomain proteins (such as bcl-2 and bcl-
xl), which contain four bh domains (bh1234), pro-apoptotic
multidomain proteins (prototypes bax and bak), which con-
tain three bh domains (bh123), and the pro-apoptotic bh3-
only protein family (letai et al, 2002). as a rule, bh1234
proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, mcl-1) mainly reside in mitochondria,
protecting these organelles against mitochondrial outer mem-
brane permeabilization (momp), one of the rate-limiting
events of apoptosis induction. either of
the two bh123
proteins (bax and bak) are required for momp, in a series
of different models of apoptosis induction (wei et al, 2001).
bh3-only proteins are suggested to kill cells by interacting
with the bh3 receptor, which is a hydrophobic groove formed
by apposition of the bh1, bh2 and bh3 domains, hence
activating bh123 proteins and/or by neutralizing bh1234
proteins. the so-called ‘bh3 mimetics’, pharmacological
compounds that bind to bh3 receptors, can induce apoptosis
or facilitate apoptosis induction in cancer cells (letai et al,
2002; oltersdorf et al, 2005).
is essential
beclin-1 (also called atg6) is a phylogenetically conserved
for the initiation of autophagy,
protein that
perhaps via its interaction with the class iii phosphatidylino-
sitol-3-kinase vps34 (zeng et al, 2006). originally, human
beclin-1 has been identiﬁed as an interactor of bcl-2 (liang
et al, 1999). caenorhabditis elegans beclin-1 (bec-1) inter-
acts with the bcl-2 homolog ced-9, and inactivation of the c.
elegans bec-1 gene causes apoptosis (takacs-vellai et al,
2005). in mammalian cells, knockdown of beclin-1 sensitizes
to apoptosis induction by starvation (boya et al, 2005; lum
et al, 2005). however, beclin-1 downregulation can also
inhibit cell death induction by conditions in which essential

constructs, followed by immunoprecipitation of flag-tagged bcl-xl and immunochemical detection of beclin-1. (f) co-immunoprecipitation of
beclin-1 with-wt and mutant (g138a) bcl-xl. results are representative of at least three experiments yielding similar results.
pro-apoptotic momp or caspase activation are blocked
(shimizu et al, 2004; yu et al, 2004), and restoration of
normal beclin-1 levels in beclin-1 deﬁcient tumor cells can
facilitate the induction of cell death by vitamin d analogues
(hoyer-hansen et al, 2005). importantly, beclin-1 is a hap-
loinsufﬁcient tumor suppressor gene (qu et al, 2003; yue
et al, 2003). transfection-enforced overexpression of beclin-1
stimulates autophagy, and this autophagy-stimulatory effect
is enhanced by depletion of bcl-2 and reduced by bcl-2
overexpression (pattingre et al, 2005).
based on these premises and incognita, we explored the
ﬁne mechanisms which govern the interaction between
beclin-1 and bcl-2/bcl-xl. as shown here, beclin-1 possesses
a bh3-like domain, thus elucidating the structural basis for
the functional beclin-1-bcl-2/bcl-xl interaction. disrupting
this interaction by bh3-only proteins or bh3 mimetics in-
creases the autophagic activity of beclin-1, thus revealing a
novel physiological role for bh3 domains.

figure 2 inhibition of the interaction between beclin-1 and anti-
apoptotic bcl-2 proteins by abt737. (a) competition between
beclin-1 bh3 and abt737 for bcl-xl binding. a ﬂuorescent 25-
mer peptide containing the bh3-like domain of beclin-1 (figure 1d)
was docked to recombinant bcl-xl dtm protein in the absence or
presence of abt737. the ic50 of abt737, as measured in the
presence of 15 nm of peptide and 100 nm of bcl-xl dtm, was
1.7 mm. (b, c) abolition of the interaction between bcl-xl and
beclin-1 by abt737 in intact cells. co-immunoprecipitation assays
were performed on hela cells transfected 48 h earlier with the
indicated constructs as in figure 1e. sixteen hours before the
immunoprecipitation, cells were exposed to abt737. similar results
were obtained for co-transfected bcl-xl and beclin-1 (b) and for
endogenous beclin-1 interacting with flag-tagged bcl-xl (c). (d, e)

acids (aa) 112 to 159 (figure 1a). a stretch of 10 amino acids
(aa 114–123) within this domain showed signiﬁcant similarity
with bh3 domains from the bcl-2 family (figure 1b). an
eicosahexapeptide (aa 107–132) comprising this bh3-like
domain in an a-helical conformation displaced a bak-derived
bh3-containing peptide binding to the hydrophobic groove of
puriﬁed recombinant bcl-xl measured in a ﬂuorescence
anisotropy assay. mutation of the most conserved residue in
the bh3-like domain of beclin-1 (l116a) as well as that of
another amino acid (f123a) (pattingre et al, 2005) abolished
the competition with bak-bh3 for bcl-xl binding (figure 1c).
the afﬁnity of the wild-type bh3 peptide from beclin-1 for
bcl-xl was high (kd 20376 nm, n ¼ 3) (figure 1d) and of an
bh3 domain in beclin-1
mc maiuri et al
order of magnitude similar to bax-bh3 (145 nm) or bak-bh3
(40 nm), although lower than bad-bh3 (10 nm) (data not
shown).
in contrast bcl-xl carrying a single mutation
(g138a) in the bh3 binding groove (ottilie et al, 1997) was
unable to interact with the beclin-derived bh3-like peptide.
to corroborate the role of the bh3-like domain for the
beclin-1 interaction with bcl-xl, cells were transfected with
wild-type or mutant beclin-1 and/or with bcl-xl, followed by
co-immunoprecipitation assays. the bh3-disrupting muta-
tion l116a almost abolished the interaction of beclin-1 with
bcl-xl (figure 1e), as well as that of beclin-1 with bcl-2 and
mcl-1 (not shown). moreover, f123a mutation reduced the
beclin-1-bcl-xl interaction (figure 1e). the g138a mutation
within the bh3-binding cleft of bcl-xl abrogated the binding
of beclin-1 in the cellular context (figure 1f). these results
suggest that a novel bh3-like domain in beclin-1 is critical for
the interaction of beclin-1 with anti-apoptotic members of the
bcl-2 family. the bh3-like domain of beclin-1 is phylogen-
etically conserved, because the beclin-1 orthologs from fugu
(takifugu rubripes), latipes (oryzia latipes) and zebraﬁsh
(danio rerio) exhibit sequence homology within their bh3-
like domain with human beclin-1 (supplementary figure
1a). peptides corresponding to these bh3-like domains in-
duced apoptosis in a bax-dependent manner when they were
microinjected into human hct116 cells (supplementary
figure 1b and c), and the peptides from fugu and latipes
(but not the ones from zebraﬁsh) are able to displace the bak
bh3 peptide from recombinant bcl-xl or bcl-2 protein in vitro
(supplementary figure 1d and e). the fact that the zebraﬁsh-
derived beclin-1 peptide did not bind to human bcl-xl yet
induced bax-dependent apoptosis, suggests that this particu-
lar peptide induces cell death by acting on a multidomain bcl-
2 family protein other than bcl-xl.
inhibition of the beclin-1-bcl-xl/bcl-2 interaction
by a bh3 mimetic
the bh3-mimetic compound abt737 (oltersdorf et al, 2005),
inhibits the binding of beclin-1 bh3 peptide to bcl-xl in a
competitive manner, with an ic50 in the micromolar range, as
determined by ﬂuorescence polarization of synthetic peptide
binding to puriﬁed recombinant bcl-xl in vitro (figure 2a).
pretreatment of cells with abt737 inhibited the co-immuno-
precipitation of flag-tagged bcl-xl and his-tagged (figure 2b)
or endogenous beclin-1 (figure 2c). abt737 also reduced the
interaction between bcl-2 and beclin-1 (figure 2d), yet had
no effect on the interaction between mcl-1 and beclin-1
(figure 2e). this can be explained by the selectivity of
abt737, which binds to bcl-2 and bcl-xl but not to mcl-1,
and hence has a bad-like proﬁle (oltersdorf et al, 2005, van
delft et al, 2006). it is important to note that abt737 also
abolished the interaction between endogenous bcl-2 and
beclin-1 (see below), meaning that these effects cannot be
attributed to overexpression-associated artifacts. altogether,
these data indicate that the bh3-like domain of beclin-1 binds
to the bh3 receptor region of bcl-xl/bcl-2 and that abt737
competitively disrupts this interaction.

dependent autophagy

bcl-2 interaction were to control beclin-1-initiated autophagy

would be expected to stimulate autophagy. accordingly,
abt737 increased the frequency of cells that manifested
cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) aggregation of the marker of au-
tophagic vacuoles, lc3-gfp. this aggregation of lc3-gfp
(which, in non-autophagic cells, is diffuse in the cytosol as
well as in the nucleus) is an established sign of autophagy
(mizushima et al, 2004), and was induced both in complete
medium as well as in conditions of nutrient depletion
(figure 3a). knockdown of beclin-1 by two distinct small
interfering rna (sirna) heteroduplexes (insert in figure 3b)
inhibited the abt737-stimulated lc3-gfp aggregation
(figure 3a and b). similarly, knockdown of other essential
atg proteins (atg5, 10, 12) reduced abt737-induced lc3-
gfp aggregation, conﬁrming that abt737 engages the classi-
cal autophagic pathway (supplementary figure 2s). since
lc3-gfp might interfere with the normal regulation of au-
tophagy, cytoplasmic vacuoles (which are bona ﬁde autop-
hagic vacuoles) were detected by staining with cmfda,
without prior transfection with lc3-gfp. again, abt737
induced signs of autophagy that could be completely sup-
pressed by the knockdown of beclin-1 (figure 3c and d).
these results could be conﬁrmed by transmission electron
microscopy showing double-membraned autophagic va-
cuoles that were elicited by abt737 and suppressed by
beclin-1-speciﬁc sirnas (figures 3e and 4). the abt737-
stimulated autophagy was organelle-speciﬁc in the sense that
lc3-gfp colocalized with the mitochondrial marker hsp60
(supplementary figure 3a and c) but not with the endoplas-
mic reticulum (er) marker calreticulin (supplementary
figure 3b and c). it is noteworthy that these results were
obtained by observing viable, adherent cells (figure 3a–e)
and that the cytotoxic pro-apoptotic effects of abt737 were
minor. thus, abt737 failed to induce a major loss of the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential (which may be asso-
ciated with apoptosis or necrosis) (figure 3f) or phosphati-
dylserine exposure (which is associated with apoptosis)
(supplementary figure 4), unless beclin-1 was depleted
simultaneously. this is in accord with the notion that
abt737 as a single agent only kills a limited set of trans-
formed cell lines (oltersdorf et al, 2005). abt737 can stimu-
late autophagy without inducing cell death.
bh3 dependency of the functional interaction between
beclin-1 and bcl-xl/bcl-2
overexpression of beclin-1 stimulates autophagy (liang et al,
1999; hoyer-hansen et al, 2005; pattingre et al, 2005), and
this effect was increased by abt737 (figure 5a and b). the
beclin-1 mutants l116a and f123a were more efﬁcient than
wild-type beclin-1 in stimulating autophagy, in line with the
fact that these mutations disrupt the interaction with the
beclin-1 inhibitors bcl-2/bcl-xl. this result was obtained
when using two different read-outs, namely lc3-gfp aggre-
gation (figure 5a and b) and cmfda-quantiﬁable vacuoliza-
tion (figure 5c and d). in the presence of abt737, the
differential capacity of wild-type beclin-1 and of its mutants
l116a and f123a to induce autophagy was matched, sug-
gesting that it was indeed the interaction between the bh3-
like domain of beclin-1 and a bh3 receptor (inhibitable by
abt737) that regulated the pro-autophagy activity of beclin-
1. these data also suggests that endogenous mcl-1 (which is
not inhibitable by abt737) (van delft et al, 2006) does not
play a crucial role in controlling autophagy induced by over-
expressed beclin-1. moreover, bcl-xl (but not bcl-xl g138a),
bcl-2 and mcl-1 all inhibited the induction of autophagy by
beclin-1 (figure 5e). the autophagy-inhibitory effect of bcl-
xl and bcl-2 was abrogated by abt737. however, abt737
the suppression of autophagy by mcl-1
did not affect
in accord with its incapacity to block the
(figure 5e),
beclin-1–mcl-1 interaction (figure 2e). altogether,
these
data suggest that abt737 stimulates (or de-inhibits) autop-

for emerin or for beclin-1 at 0 h) were re-transfected with lc3-gfp
ﬁnally cultured in nutrient-free (nf) conditions (60–72 h), in the
presence or absence 1 mm abt737 and then subjected to electron
microscopic detection of immature (av1) or mature (av2) autop-
hagic vacuoles. representative pictures are shown in (a). the
number of av1 and av2 was determined for a minimum of 50

bh3 domain of beclin-1 and the bh3 receptor regions of bcl-

spatially restricted, regulated interactions between
bcl-2 and beclin-1 are inhibited by abt737
abt737 as well as nutrient depletion reduced the amount of
endogenous beclin-1 that immunoprecipitated with endogen-
ous bcl-2, both in hela and in mv4.11 cells (figure 6a),
conﬁrming that physiological levels of these proteins can
interact in a fashion that is inhibited by nutrient depletion
or abt737. bcl-2 associates both with er and mitochondrial
membranes (germain and shore, 2003). wild-type and er-
targeted bcl-2 (bcl-2-cb5) but not mitochondrion-targeted
bcl-2 (bcl-2-acta)
inhibits starvation-induced autophagy
(pattingre et al, 2005), suggesting that the autophagy-regula-
tory pool of bcl-2 is localized on er. to investigate this, we
determined the inhibitory effect of abt737 and nutrient
depletion on the bcl-2-beclin-1 interaction in cell lines that
stably express wild-type bcl-2, bcl-2-cb5, or bcl-2-acta. the
amount of beclin-1 that co-immunoprecipitated with wild
type and bcl-2-cb5 diminished after treatment with abt737
or starvation, whereas the amount of beclin-1 that co-im-
munoprecipiated with
constant
(figure 6b). these results could be further substantiated by
subcellular fractionation. the interaction between wild-type
bcl-2 and beclin-1 measurable in microsomes (er) was
reduced by abt737 or starvation, but remained constant
within the heavy membrane fraction (mitochondria) (figure
6c and d). hence, only the er-targeted pool of bcl-2 is
relevant to the inhibition of autophagy.

starvation-induced induction of autophagy via the
bh3-only protein bad
the results above imply that, to the very least in certain
instances, induction of beclin-1-mediated autophagy should
correlate with its release from inhibitory complexes. upon
starvation, the amount of endogenous beclin-1 that co-im-
munoprecipitated with bcl-xl declined within the ﬁrst hour
of serum and nutrient withdrawal, whereas the amount of the
bh3 protein bad (whose activation is known to be triggered
by serum withdrawal) (danial and korsmeyer, 2004) that co-
immunoprecipitated with bcl-xl increased (figure 7a). in
contrast, addition of rapamycin (which induces autophagy by
inhibition of mtor) (sarbassovdos et al, 2005) or other
autophagy inducers that affect the level of phosphatidyl
inositol-3-phoshate (sarkar et al, 2005) had less marked
effects on the interactions between beclin-1, bcl-xl and bad
(figure 7b). upon starvation (but not upon abt737 addi-
tion), the amount of endogenous bad that immunoprecipi-
tated with endogenous bcl-2 also increased (figure 7c), at
the same time as the bcl-2–beclin-1 interaction was reduced
(figure
sirna-mediated depletion of bad

autophagy, yet had no or little effect on rapamycin-induced

figure 6 interaction between endogenous and spatially restricted bcl-2 and beclin-1 in starvation and after addition of abt737. (a)
immunoprecipitation of endogenous bcl-2 and beclin-1. untransfected hela or mv4.11 cells were treated by culture in nutrient-free ebss
or with abt737 (1 mm). (b) immunoprecipitation of wild-type and er-targeted bcl-2 with beclin-1. cells stably transfected with wild type, er-
and mitochondrion-targeted bcl-2 were subjected to starvation or treated with abt737, followed by immunoprecipitation of bcl-2 and
immunodetection of beclin-1. (c, d) immunoprecipitation of bcl-2 and beclin-1 in subcellular fractions. cells treated as in (b) were lysed and
subjected to subcellular fractionation to enrich either er vesicles (microsomes, (c)) or mitochondria (heavy membrane fraction, (d)), followed
by immunoprecipitation of bcl-2 and immunodetection of beclin-1. calreticulin and hsp60 were used as internal controls. results are
representative of three independent determinations.
compromised the disruption of the beclin-1/bcl-2 interaction
induced by starvation, yet had no effect on the disruption of
this interaction by abt737 (figure 7g). the effect of bad
depletion/deletion on starvation-induced autophagy (figure
7d and f) and on the changing beclin-1/bcl-2 interaction
(figure 7g) was partial, suggesting that bad is not the sole
bh3 protein linking starvation to autophagy induction
or that bh3-independent mechanisms may be involved.
transfection-enforced overexpression of bad was sufﬁcient
to induce autophagy both in normal conditions and condi-
tions of caspase inhibition (figure 7h). these results indicate
that bh3-only proteins including bad may participate in the
activation of autophagy by starvation.
regulation of autophagy by the bh3-only protein egl-1
in c. elegans
egl-1 is the sole pro-apoptotic bh3-only protein in c. elegans
and is required for developmental cell death in this nematode
(conradt and horvitz, 1998, 1999). hence, this model organ-
ism is uniquely suitable to determine the phylogenetically
conserved regulation of autophagy by bh3-only proteins. in
c. elegans, lgg-1 (the nematode orthologue of atg8/lc3) is
ubiquitously expressed throughout development and induced
in conditions of autophagy (melendez et al, 2003). autophagy
was monitored using an lgg-1hdsred reporter in embryos
that carry a wild-type, gain-of-function or deletion allele of
egl-1,
in normal conditions or after starvation. starvation
strongly induced autophagy, and this induction was blunted
in egl-1-deﬁcient nematode embryos. in contrast, the gain-
of-function mutation of egl-1 caused an increase in constitutive
autophagy that was not enhanced further by starvation
(figure 8). these results underscore the phylogenetic conser-
vation of autophagy control by bh3-only proteins.
discussion
as shown here, beclin-1 possesses a bh3 domain that
dictates its interaction with the bh3 receptor domain of
anti-apoptotic proteins of the bcl-2 family including bcl-2,
bcl-xl and mcl-1. a recent report, which was published when
this paper was under review, revealed the crystallographic
structure of human bcl-xl interacting with a peptide (aa 107–
135) derived from human beclin-1 and corroborated the
hypothesis that beclin-1 possesses a bh3-like amphipathic
a-helix that can bind to the conserved hydrophobic groove of
bcl-xl (oberstein et al, 2007). as shown here, this interaction
is physiologically important because its inhibition by the
bh3-only protein bad and by a bad-like bh3 mimetic can
stimulate autophagy.
beclin-1 possesses a bh3 domain that, in the form of a
synthetic peptide excised from the context of the whole
protein, induces bax-dependent apoptosis. upon overexpres-
it promotes bcl-xl-inhibitable autophagy
sion, however,
rather than apoptosis, beclin appears therefore as a new
type of bh3 protein, in which this domain plays a regulatory,
rather than an effector function.
the prevalence of the autophagic activity of bh3-contain-
ing beclin-1 and its failure to induce apoptosis in an in vivo
context raises important mechanistic questions. regulatory
sequences in the beclin-1 full-length protein, or the structure
of the beclin-1 bh3 domain itself, may normally prevent the
bh3 motif in beclin-1 from activating apoptosis, perhaps
because of different afﬁnities between bh3-only proteins
for anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family members in a cellular context.
indeed, in the recent report of the structure of beclin-1 bh3
peptide binding to bcl-xl,
interaction features suggest
a distinct binding speciﬁcity (oberstein et al, 2007).

alternatively, there could be different pools of anti-apoptotic
multidomain bcl-2 proteins, some sequestering pro-apoptotic
bcl-2 family members, others beclin-1, and that these may be
selectively displaced by other bh3 proteins, again perhaps
reﬂecting their different afﬁnities and/or subcellular com-
partmentalization.
in favour of this latter possibility, we found that abt737 as
well as nutrient withdrawal only affected the interaction
between beclin-1 and er-localized bcl-2. the mechanisms
through which abt737 may effect the interaction between
er-localized bcl-2-beclin–1 complexes (but not those found
on mitochondria) are elusive. on the one hand, the afﬁnity of
abt737 for bcl-2 may be inﬂuenced by post-transcriptional
alterations (such as bcl-2 phosphorylation; konopleva et al,
2006) that may correlate with its subcellular localization
(ruvolo et al, 1998). on the other hand, the nature of the
physicochemical
interaction between bcl-2 and beclin-1
might be conditioned by the presence of additional orga-
nelle-speciﬁc proteins, such as ip3r (1,4,5-inositol trispho-
sphate receptor) in er (chen et al, 2004; criollo et al, 2007)
and vdac (voltage-dependent anion channel) in mitochon-
dria (shimizu et al, 1999). while mitochondrial bcl-2 and
bcl-xl could be the preferential target for the pro-apoptotic
function of bh3-only proteins, er-resident bcl-2-beclin-1
complexes could be selectively disrupted by competing bh3
domains (such as that of bad) or bh3 mimetics for the
induction of autophagy, which is agreement with the ﬁndings
of pattingre et al (2005) showing that only er-targeted bcl-2
inhibits autophagy.
it is noteworthy that the regulation of autophagy by bh3-
only proteins is phylogenetically old. this does not only
apply to the conservation of the bh3-like domain of beclin-
1 in non-mammalian species but extends to the observation
that egl-1, the sole bh3-only protein of c. elegans, sufﬁces to
trigger autophagy and is a mediator of starvation-induced
autophagy. it should be noted that loss-of-function mutants
of egl-1 (in c. elegans) and depletion/deletion of bad (in
human and mouse cells) did not completely abolish starva-
tion-induced autophagy, in line with the presence of redun-
dant regulatory pathways (shintani and klionsky, 2004) in
which bh3-only proteins play a prominent but not exclusive
role.
by virtue of its bh3-mimetic action, abt737 exerts two
distinct cellular effects. on the one hand, it inhibits the anti-
apoptotic action of bcl-2 or bcl-xl, as established previously
(oltersdorf et al, 2005), thus triggering apoptosis in cells in
which neutralization of bcl-2 or bcl-xl is sufﬁcient to de-
inhibit the mitochondrial cell death pathway. on the other
hand, abt737 stimulates autophagy, which can be viewed as
a cytoprotective mechanism (boya et al, 2005; lum et al,
2005). although at present no clinically applicable autophagy
inhibitors are available, these results point to the possibility
of using autophagy inhibitors for sensitizing tumor cells to
bh3 mimetics or indirect activators of bh3-dependent apop-
totic pathways.
in conclusion, our data support a novel function of the
bh3-binding site of bcl-2 homolog, namely regulation of
autophagy. beyond their established function as cell death
inducers, bh3-only proteins or bh3 mimetics can induce
autophagy by competitively disrupting the interaction of
beclin-1 with bcl-2/bcl-xl. our ﬁndings indicate a hitherto
unexpected crosstalk between self-killing and self-eating.
both phenomena are controlled by bh3-only proteins.

plasmids, transfection and rna interference
cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected at 80%
conﬂuence with oligofectamine (invitrogen), in the presence of
100 nm of sirnas speciﬁc for human beclin-1 and other atg genes
(boya et al, 2005; gonzalez-polo et al, 2005), bad (sirna1 from jin

protein emerin (harborth et al, 2001). sirna effects were controlled
by immunoblots with suitable antibodies speciﬁc for beclin-1
(santacruz), bad (santacruz) or vps34 (zymed). transient
transfections with cdnas were performed with lipofectamine
2000 reagent (invitrogen), and cells were used 24 h after transfec-
tion unless speciﬁed differently. cells were transfected with empty
vector alone or together with lc3-gfp (kabeya et al, 2000), in the
presence or absence of beclin-1 wild type, beclin-1 l116a, beclin-1
f123a, bcl-xl wild type, bcl-xl g138a, bcl-2 wild type, or mcl-1.
yeast two-hybrid system
bcl-xl and bcl-2 without their c-terminal transmembrane domains
(bcl-xl 1–624and bcl-2 1–630) were pcr ampliﬁed (pfu, strata-
gene) and cloned n-terminal to the lexa dna binding domain in
the pb24 vector. cdna libraries constructed in pp6 vector
(fromont-racine et al, 2002) were transformed into the y187 yeast
strain. ten million independent yeast colonies were collected,
pooled and stored at  801c as equivalent aliquot fractions of the
same library. the mating protocol has been described (fromont-
racine et al, 2002). each screen was performed to ensure a
minimum of 50 million interactions. the prey fragments of the
positive clones were ampliﬁed by pcr and sequenced at their 50 and
30 junctions on a pe3700 sequencer. the resulting sequences were
used to identify the corresponding gene in the genbank database
(ncbi).
peptides and recombinant protein
recombinant gst fused to bcl-xl wild type or bcl-xl g138a (pgex
5x vector, amersham) deleted of
the c-terminal 21 aa were
produced in escherichia coli (bl21) and puriﬁed on glutathione–
sepharose resin (amersham). hplc-puriﬁed beclin wild-type
(gtmenlsrrlkvtgdlfdimsgqtdv), beclin l116a (gtmenl
srrakvtgdlfdimsgqtdv), beclin f123a (gtmenlsrrlkvtg

were obtained from neosystem.
fluorescence polarization assays
fluorescence polarization (fp) assays (measured with a fusiontm-
packard equipment) were performed essentially as described (letai
et al., 2002). brieﬂy, for competition experiments, ﬂuorescent bak
bh3 peptide (15 nm) and gst- bcl-xl (100 nm) were mixed in
binding buffer (20 mm na2hpo4 ph 7.4, 50 mm nacl, 1 mm edta
and 0.05% pluronic acid) with titrations of competing peptides
(beclin wild type, beclin l116a, beclin f123a or bak bh3, from
10 9 to 10 4 m). for afﬁnity constant (kd) calculations, ﬂuorescent
beclin peptide (15 nm) was mixed with increasing amounts of gst-
bcl-xl wild type or gst- bcl-xl g138a (10 9–10 5 m).
co-immunoprecipitation experiments
hela cells were transiently transfected using effecten reagent
(qiagen) with pcdna3topod vectors (invitrogen) expressing v5-
his-tagged beclin constructs (wild type, l116a or f123a) alone or
together with flag-tagged bcl-xl wild type, bcl-xl g138a, bcl-2
wild type or mcl-1 wild type (p3xﬂag vectors, sigma). twenty-four
hours later, cells were collected and lysed in ripa buffer. the
cleared lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with
anti-flag beads (sigma). the immunoprecipitates were analysed by
immunoblot with anti-beclin antibody (santa cruz, h300), anti-bcl-
xl (transduction laboratory) or anti-mcl-1 (santacruz, s19). hela
cells, mv4.11, wt and bad /  mef and cells expressing bcl-2 acta
or bcl-2 cb5 (10 106 cells) were collected, lysed and/fractionated
(focustm subcell, g biosciences, usa), and the immunoprecipita-
tion was performed (chen et al, 2004) using anti-bcl-2 (santa cruz)
antibody and protein g-sepharose (ge healthcare), followed by
immunoblot detection of beclin-1 and bad (antibodies from
santacruz).

western blot analysis
cells were washed with cold pbs at 41c and lysed. forty mg of
protein were loaded on a 10% sds–page and transferred to
nitrocellulose. the membrane was incubated for 1 h in pbs-tween
20 (0.05%) containing 5% nonfat milk. primary antibody anti-
beclin1 (santacruz), bad (santacruz), hvps (zymed) was incu-
bated for 15 h at 41c and revealed with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (southern biotechnologies
associates) plus the supersignal west pico chemoluminiscent
substrate (pierce). anti-gapdh (chemicon), anti-hsp60 (sigma)
or anti-calreticulin (stressgen) antibody was used to ensure equal
loading.
flow cytometry
the following ﬂuorochromes were employed to determine apopto-
sis-associated changes by cytoﬂuorometry: 3,30-dihexyloxacarbo-
cyanine iodide (dioc6(3)
the
transmembrane potential (dcm) and propidium
mitochondrial
iodide (pi; 1 mg/ml) for determination of cell viability (molecular
probes) (gonzalez-polo et al, 2005). trypsinized cells were labeled
with the ﬂuorochromes at 371c,
followed by cytoﬂuorometric
analysis with a ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) scan
(becton dickinson).
for quantiﬁcation of
(40 nm)
light microscopy, immunoﬂuorescence, and electron
microscopy
cells cultured on coverslips were stained with cell tracker green
5-chloromethylﬂuorescein diacetate (cmfda (1 mm); molecular
probes) and hoechst 33342 (2 mm; sigma). alternatively, cells were
ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde (4% w:v) for lc3-gfp and immuno-
ﬂuorescence assays (obeid et al, 2007). cells presenting a mostly
diffuse distribution of lc3-gfp in the cytoplasm and nucleus were
considered as non-autophagic, whereas cells representing several
intense punctuate lc3-gfp aggregates with no nuclear lc3-gfp
were classiﬁed as autophagic. each lc3-gfp staining was read by
two independent investigators (mc maiuri and a criollo or e
tasdemir). transmission electron microscopy was performed as
described (gonzalez-polo et al, 2005).
nematode experiments
to generate the plgg 1dsredhlgg-1 reporter construct, we fused
dsred to the n-terminus of c. elegans lgg-1. a 750 bp fragment
containing the lgg-1 gene was ampliﬁed using the following oligos:
50-ggaattcgaagtgggcttacaaggagga-30 and 50-ggaattcg
tcttcttcgtttattcatg-30, and inserted at the c-terminus of
dsred. the reporter fusion was placed under the lgg-1 promoter. to
obtain the promoter, we ampliﬁed a 1934 bp fragment upstream of
the lgg-1 gene using the following oligos: 50-acatgcatgcgca
ctttcaaggcgacagta-30 and 50-ggggtacctcctccttgtaag
cccactt-30. the reporter construct was injected into the gonads
of n2 animals together with a plasmid that carries a pmyo 2gfp
reporter fusion, expressing gfp in the pharyngeal muscle cells, as a
transformation marker. transgenic males were crossed with egl-1
mutant hermaphrodites to obtain mutants carrying the autophago-
somal marker (brenner, 1974). the c. elegans strains n2: wild-type
egl-1(n487), rb1305: egl-1(ok1418),
bristol
n2;ex[plgg 1dsredhlgg-1], egl-1(n487);ex[plgg 1dsredhlgg-1]
and egl-1(ok1418);ex[plgg 1dsredhlgg-1] were obtained from the
c. elegans knockout consortium (robert barstead, oklahoma
medical research foundation, usa) or the caenorhabditis genetics
center (theresa stiernagle, university of minnesota, minneapolis,
usa). to monitor dsredhlgg-1 levels in embryos, eggs were
obtained from transgenic gravid hermaphrodite adults, expressing
plgg 1dsredhlgg-1. for starvation experiments,
late l4 larval
stage animals were grown in the absence of food and eggs were
collected between 12–24 h into adulthood.
isolate, mt1082:
transgenic embryos expressing dsred were photographed on an
axioskop 2 plus, epiﬂuorescence microscope (carl zeiss, jena,
germany). images were acquired using a 480710 nm band-pass
excitation ﬁlter and a 515715 nm band-pass emission ﬁlter.
experiments were performed at 201c, with photography exposure
time kept identical for each experiment. emission intensity was
measured on greyscale images with a pixel depth of 8 bit (256
shades of gray). the mean and maximum pixel intensity for each
embryo in these images (minimum 25 over three independent trials)
was determined with imagej software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
