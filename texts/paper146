mucolipidosis type iv is a genetic lysosomal storage disease
associated with degenerative processes in the brain, eye, and
other tissues. mucolipidosis type iv results from mutations in
the gene mcoln1, which codes for the trp family ion channel,
mucolipin 1. the connection between lysosomal dysfunction
and degenerative processes in mucolipidosis type iv is unclear.
here we report that mucolipidosis type iv and several unrelated
lysosomal storage diseases are associated with significant mito-
chondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial ca2ⴙ
buffering efficiency. the mitochondrial alterations observed in
these lysosomal storage diseases are reproduced in control cells
by treatment with lysosomal inhibitors and with the autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine. this suggests that inefficient autoph-
agolysosomal recycling of mitochondria generates fragmented,
effete mitochondria in mucolipidosis. mitochondria accumulate

mucolipidosis (ml)3 is the collective name for a group of
autosomal recessive diseases characterized by accumulation of
membranous lipid inclusions in patients’ cells (1, 2). there are
four types of ml, three of which (mlii, mliiia, and mliiic)

involve incorrect intracellular targeting of lysosomal
lipid
hydrolases, resulting in inefficient processing of endocytosed
lipids (3–5). although the cellular phenotype of type iv (mliv)
is similar to other mls, mliv is linked to mutations in the ion
channel, mucolipin 1 (trp-ml1), a member of the trp fam-
ily of ion channels (6–8). the current consensus assigns
trp-ml1 a role in some aspect of lysosomal/endosomal
function (4, 9, 10).
the pathological manifestations of mliv are retinal degen-
eration, corneal cloudiness, and neuromotor retardation (11,
12). brain mri studies of autopsied cases are consistent with
demyelinization, neuronal death, and neuronal loss in the cer-
ebral cortex, basal ganglia, and deep cerebellar and brainstem
nuclei (13, 14). the degenerative processes in mliv and in
most other lysosomal storage diseases (lsds) are not limited to
brain but also involve skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, parietal
cell, and other tissues (15–17).
the range of pathological manifestations in many lsds is
similar and suggests that a generalized mechanism of degener-
ation exists. one such mechanism may involve the lysosomal-
mitochondrial axis, as proposed for aged cardiac myocytes (18,
19). this model suggests that accumulation of lipofuscin in
lysosomes of post-mitotic cardiac myocytes impairs lysosomal
function. because lysosomes are major players in autophagic
recycling of mitochondria (20–22), lysosomal inactivation by
lipofuscin deposits results in accumulation of fragmented, dys-
functional mitochondria (18, 23). normally, mitochondrial
fragmentation is the result of activity of a dynamin-related pro-
tein, drp1 (24, 25), and other proteins (26–30) that cleave
mitochondria destined for degradation into smaller pieces to
facilitate their engulfment by autophagosomes. therefore, one
expects to see accumulation of fragmented mitochondria in
cells with lysosomal deficiencies. by analogy with this model,
we proposed that lysosomal deficiencies in lsds should also
affect mitochondrial homeostasis.
normal mitochondria are frequently arranged in extended
linear networks, allowing intermitochondrial communication
to facilitate crucial energetic and calcium buffering functions
(reviewed in refs. 31 and 32). our results demonstrate signifi-
cant changes in both the appearance and function of mitochon-
dria in skin fibroblast cultures from patients with mliv and
other lsds. this is pathogenically significant for mucolipido-
ses because post-mitotic neurons and cardiomyocytes are espe-
cially sensitive to alterations in mitochondrial function (18, 24,
33). we hypothesize that impaired lysosomal function in mliv
affects autophagy of mitochondria, which leads to accumula-
tion of effete mitochondria that cannot effectively buffer cyto-

plasmic ca2⫹. as a result, cells affected by mliv are more sen-
sitive to pro-apoptotic effects of ca2⫹-mobilizing agonists than
cells with normal mitochondria.
at present, little is known about the pathways leading to cell
death in lsds. a recent paper by schaheen et al. (34) reports
that mutations in cup-5, a caenorhabditis elegans orthologue
of trp-ml1, lead to increased apoptosis, but it did not explain
why a cell death pathway is activated in the cup-5-deficient
cells. we believe that our results provide a mechanistic expla-
nation that links suppression of lysosomal function in mliv,
and perhaps other lsds, with cell death.

cells—skin fibroblasts from mliv, mlii, and mliii patients
(clones wg 0909, wg 0229, and wg 0109) and corresponding
heterozygous nondiseased parent skin fibroblasts (clones wg
0987 and wg 0140) were obtained from the repository for
mutant human cell strains of montreal children’s hospital
(montreal, canada). mliv fibroblasts clone gm02525 and
cln2 fibroblasts clone gm09404 were from coriell cell
repositories (boston, ma). fibroblasts were grown in dulbec-
co’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% streptomycin (all from atlanta biologi-
cals, atlanta, ga).
confocal immunocytochemistry—for experiments with fixed
cells, the cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed and perme-
abilized by 10 min of incubation at ⫺20 °c with 100% methanol
or were fixed by a 5-min incubation with 3.7% formaldehyde
and permeabilized by incubation with 0.01% triton x-100 at
4 °c for 5 min. after fixation, nonspecific sites were blocked by
incubation in 5% goat serum. subsequently the cells were incu-
bated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution. follow-
ing wash-out of the primary antibodies with pbs, the cells were
stained with fluorescent secondary antibodies and analyzed as
above. primary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry for
lc3 were clone h-50 and clone 6h2 for cytochrome c. they
were from santa cruz biotechnology (santa cruz, ca). the
primary cytochrome c antibodies used in western blotting
were clone 6h2.b4 from zymed laboratories inc. (san fran-
cisco, ca). primary antibodies for caspase-8 (clone 1c12) were
from cell signaling (danvers, ma).
for experiments with live cells, the cells on coverslips were
bathed in the standard bath solution, which contained 140 mm
nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes, ph
7.4. following loading with dyes and three washes, the cover-
slips were mounted into a perfusion chamber containing stand-
ard solution. the chamber was placed on the stage of a bio-rad
1024 confocal microscope, and fluorescence was recorded and
analyzed off-line using imagej software.
measurement of [ca2⫹]i—for standard fluorescence record-
ing experiments, the cells grown on coverslips were loaded with
5 ␮m fura-2am in the standard solution for 30 min at 37 °c.
following three washes, the coverslips were placed in the per-
fusion chamber that allows rapid exchange of bath solutions.
the solutions were applied by bath perfusion with ten volumes
of the perfusion chamber. fura was excited by alternating 340/
380-nm light, and the resulting 510-nm fluorescence was
recorded through a ccd-cooled camera and analyzed using
metafluor software (universal images corporation).
to record mitochondrial ca2⫹, the cells were loaded with
rhod2 and analyzed essentially as above. to record mdc fluo-
rescence, the coverslips were washed three times with 1⫻ pbs
and incubated with 0.05 mm mdc diluted in 1⫻ pbs for 10 min
at 37 °c. the coverslips were washed three times with 1⫻
pbs to remove excess and placed in the perfusion chamber.
mdc fluorescence was excited by 340-nm light and
recorded at 510 nm.
apoptosis assays—tunel and annexin v-based assays were
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(molecular probes, eugene, or). confluent coverslips, either
untreated or treated with an apoptosis-inducing agonist, were
washed three times with 1⫻ pbs. the cells were fixed with
⫺20 °c methanol for 10 min and washed three times with 1⫻
pbs. the coverslips were incubated in 300 nm dapi (molecular
probes, eugene, or) diluted in 1⫻ pbs for 5 min, washed three
times with 1⫻ pbs, and mounted on slides.
caspase-8 fluorogenic substrates—the fluorogenic z-
ietd-afc substrate (calbiochem, san diego, ca) was used to
measure the caspase-8 activity in this study (35). lysate (10 ␮g
of protein) was prepared in 200 ␮l of reaction buffer (0.1%
chaps buffer containing 20 mm pipes, 100 mm nacl, 10 mm
dithiothreitol, 1 mm edta, and 10% sucrose) and mixed with
20 ␮m z-ietd-afc. the fluorescence of the cleavage product
was measured over time at 37 °c in a microplate spectroflu-
orometer (molecular devices; excitation wavelength, 400 nm;
emission, 505 nm). proteolytic activity was expressed as relative
fluorescence units normalized to control cultures.

from a heterozygous control relative and a mliv patient,
homozygous for the trp-ml1 mutation (clones wg0987 and
wg0909, henceforth identified as mliv-control and mliv
fibroblasts, respectively) were stained with 1 ␮m mitotracker
red or 1 ␮m 123-rhodamine. at these concentrations, both
dyes showed nearly perfect overlap, and from this point on, the
description and statistical analysis of mitochondrial appear-
ance in the two cell types were performed on 123-rhodamine-
stained cells. confocal analysis revealed significant differences
in mitochondrial appearance between mliv-control and
mliv cells. mitochondrial chain length was estimated by man-
ually tracing unbranched mitochondria on confocal images of
the cells and measuring their length using imagej software. in

esized that depressed lysosomal function contributed to the
mitochondrial fragmentation observed in mliv fibroblasts.
furthermore, a prediction can be made that mitochondrial
fragmentation similar to that observed in mliv fibroblasts and
aged cardiac myocytes should also be observed in fibroblasts
with other lsds or in cells whose lysosomal function is sup-
pressed by pharmacological means.
mitochondrial alterations in other mucolipidoses—fig. 1 (a
and b) shows that mitochondrial
fragmentation is also
observed in fibroblasts from an mliii patient but not from a
matching heterozygous control relative (clones wg0109 and
wg0140 will be identified as mliii and mliii-control, respec-
tively). average mitochondrial numbers were 34.8 ⫾ 3.5 (n ⫽

fibroblasts (n ⫽ 10, p ⬍ 0.05) (fig. 1, a and b). fibroblasts from

(cln2, clone gm09404), which is a result of mutations in a
gene coding for tripeptidyl peptidase i, also contained numer-
ous, fragmented mitochondria (average mitochondrial length

function, autophagy,
and mitochondrial
fragmentation—mlii, mliii, mliv, and cln2 are caused by
lysosomal dysfunctions linked to inefficient breakdown of lip-
ids or proteins (37, 38). the fact that these lsds result from
mutations in completely different proteins yet cause same
mitochondrial phenotype indicates a common cause of mito-
chondrial fragmentation in these diseases, such as lysosomal
dysfunction. we used a series of lysosomal degradation inhibi-
tors to determine whether impaired completion of autoph-
agolysosomal degradation could explain the observed alter-
ations in mitochondrial organization in the mutant cells.
lysosomal function was suppressed using bafilomycin, which
blocks the lysosomal v-type h⫹ pump, nigericin, the h⫹ iono-
phore, and ammonium chloride, which disrupt the acidic envi-
ronment essential for lysosomal hydrolase activities (39). fig. 2
shows that treatment of mliv-control and mliii-control cells
with bafilomycin (0.1–100 nm) for 3 days induced mitochon-
drial fragmentation similar to that observed in the lsd fibro-
blasts (fig. 2a). average mitochondrial lengths in bafilomycin-
treated mitochondria were 21.0 ⫾ 0.8 and 10.7 ⫾ 0.5 ␮m,
respectively (n ⫽ 20 and 20, p ⬍ 0.05 for both sets). short treat-
ment with bafilomycin did not induce significant mitochon-
drial fragmentation (fig. 2, a and b). therefore, these changes
do not reflect rapid induction of mitochondrial fission by lyso-
somal or autophagy inhibitors. counting individual mitochon-
dria in control and treated cells confirmed that cells treated
with lysosomal inhibitors contained more discrete mitochon-
drial fragments than untreated cells (fig. 2c). similar results
were obtained with nigericin and ammonium chloride used as
lysosomal inhibitors (data not shown).
the primary pathway through which mitochondria recycle
and renew is autophagy, a process in which lysosomes are key
participants (33, 40, 41). upstream signals that stimulate auto-
phagy include vps34, a class iii pi3k, and inhibition of vps34

same fragmentation pattern as 123-rhodamine. similar results
were obtained with the mliv fibroblasts clone gm02525 (not
shown). as another indicator of mitochondrial fragmentation,
the numbers of separately identifiable mitochondrial particles/
cell were analyzed. the average numbers of mitochondria in
mliv-control fibroblasts were 32.6 ⫾ 3.8 (n ⫽ 11) and 94.5 ⫾
7.8 (n ⫽ 12, p ⬍ 0.05) in mliv cells (fig. 1b). mitochondrial
fragmentation in mliv cells was associated not only with an
increase in numbers of shorter mitochondria but also with a
depletion of longer mitochondria (see a representative histo-
gram in fig. 1c).
mitochondrial fragmentation in mliv fibroblasts cannot be
explained by differences between proliferation rates of control
and mliv fibroblasts because our own observations do not
indicate such a difference. trp-ml1 did not colocalize with
mitochondria (data not shown) and is therefore unlikely to
directly regulate mitochondrial length and/or function.
mitochondrial fragmentation was previously reported in
post-mitotic myocytes with lipofuscin deposits in lysosomes
(18, 19, 23, 36), and because mliv is associated with sup-
pressed lipid degradation in the lysosomal pathway, we hypoth-

sients that might otherwise be dam-
aging for cells (43–45). mitochon-
dria are normally organized as
extended cellular networks, and we
hypothesized that disruption of this
network would significantly impair
mitochondrial ca2⫹ buffering.
to test [ca2⫹]i buffering by mito-
chondria, the cells were stimulated
with a ca2⫹-mobilizing agonist,
bradykinin (bk), and the amount of
ca2⫹ accumulated in mitochondria
after completion of the ca2⫹ flux
was compared. bk activates phos-
pholipase c␤, generates inositol (1,
4, 5) trisphosphate, and induces
both ca2⫹ release for endoplasmic
reticulum and associated ca2⫹
influx
and
mliv fibroblasts showed normal
ca2⫹ release and influx (fig. 3a).
the endoplasmic reticulum ca2⫹
load in mliv-control and mliv
fibroblasts was previously analyzed
using ionomycin and was found to
be very similar in the two cell types
(8). therefore, the differences in
mitochondrial ca2⫹ load described
below can be directly attributed to
variations in mitochondrial ca2⫹
(46). mliv-control
by 3-ma effectively inhibits starvation-induced autophagy
(42). to see whether disrupted autophagy could result in mito-
chondrial changes observed in mliv and mliii fibroblasts, we
used a pharmacologic inhibitor of autophagy. fig. 2a shows
that treating mliv-control and mliii-control fibroblasts with
5 mm 3-ma for 3–4 days induced mitochondrial fragmentation
similar to that observed in mliv and mliii fibroblasts. aver-
age mitochondrial lengths of 3-ma-treated mliv-control and
mliii-control fibroblasts were 32.3 ⫾ 1.7 and 34.7 ⫾ 2.4 ␮m,
respectively (n ⫽ 20 and 20, p ⬍ 0.05). short, 1-h treatment
with 3-ma did not induce noticeable mitochondrial fragmen-
tation (fig. 2, b and c), indicating that 3-ma does not directly
induce mitochondrial fission. thus, inhibition of autophagocyto-
sis results in the loss of the extended, filamentous mitochondrial
network and accumulation of individual, isolated mitochondria as
observed in mliv and mliii fibroblasts. the number of individ-
ual mitochondria per cell was also higher in 3-ma-treated control
fibroblasts than in untreated controls (fig. 2c).
based on these three series of experiments, we conclude that
suppression of lysosomal function in lsds results in the accu-
mulation of isolated, fragmented mitochondria. by analogy
with lipofuscin-induced mitochondrial fragmentation reported
by terman et al. (18), we hypothesize that mitochondrial frag-
mentation in lsds is a result of suppressed autolysosomal deg-
radation of mitochondria.
mitochondrial ca2⫹ buffering in mliv—mitochondria are
involved in ca2⫹ homeostasis because they work as ca2⫹ sinks
buffering cytoplasmic ca2⫹ and preventing large ca2⫹ tran-
uptake in control and lsd cells.
during the [ca2⫹]i spike, some of the ca2⫹ is accumulated by
mitochondria; this amount can be estimated by releasing mito-
chondrial ca2⫹ with the mitochondrial uncoupler fccp,
which collapses mitochondrial membrane potential. when
applied during ca2⫹ response, 0.1 ␮m fccp induced an
increase in [ca2⫹]i in 9 of 14 of mliv-control cells (fig. 3a).
the increase was never seen in mliv fibroblasts (25 cells
tested). similar results were obtained with gm02525 mliv
fibroblasts. we conclude that the mitochondrial ca2⫹ buffer-
ing capacity is markedly reduced in mliv fibroblasts as com-
pared with mliv-control fibroblasts. to determine whether
suppressed mitochondrial ca2⫹ accumulation could be a gen-
eral feature of lsds, we used mliii-control and mliii fibroblasts.
fig. 3a shows that much like mliv fibroblasts, mliii fibroblasts
did not release ca2⫹ in response to fccp application during bk-
inducedca2⫹response,whereasmliii-controlsfdid.thesedata
represent 11 of 11 mliii-control and 12 of 12 mliii fibroblasts.
no mitochondrial ca2⫹ accumulation was detected in 20 of 20
mlii or 10 of 10 cln2 fibroblasts (data not shown).
because fccp is a h⫹ ionophore, a possibility exists that the
fccp-induced ca2⫹ release originates, at least partially, from
lysosomes. to remove this uncertainty, we depleted lysosomal
ca2⫹ by bursting lysosomes using 100 ␮m glycyl-phenylala-
nine-naphthylamide. this peptide is cleaved in lysosomes, thus
exerting osmotic pressure on their membranes. the resulting
osmotic shock bursts lysosomes and releases lysosomal ca2⫹
(47, 48). we found that bursting lysosomes with glycyl-phenyl-
39044 journal of biological chemistry

was equally effective in dissipating
123-rhodamine mitochondrial stain
(fig. 3b).
the fccp-based assay was vali-
dated by directly measuring mito-
chondrial ca2⫹ using mitochon-
drial ca2⫹ indicator rhod2. fig. 3c
shows that stimulation with bk sig-
nificantly increases mitochondrial
ca2⫹ in mliv-control, but not
mliv cells. although rhod2 may
pick up cytoplasmic ca2⫹, and cyto-
plasmic ca2⫹ signals may bias mito-
chondrial ca2⫹ measurements, the
amplitudes of ca2⫹ signals induced
by bk in mliv-control and mliv
cells were essentially the same (fig.
3a; see also ref. 8). therefore, the
difference between ca2⫹ signals
detected with rhod2 in mliv and
mliv-control cells is a direct reflec-
tion of different ca2⫹ uptake by
mitochondria in these cells. two
independent approaches demon-
strate the loss of mitochondrial
ca2⫹ uptake in mliv fibroblasts.
the link between lysosomal dys-
function and mitochondrial ca2⫹
buffering was further probed using
mliv-control and mliii-control
cells in which autophagocytosis or
lysosomal function was inhibited.
fig. 4a shows that incubating the
cells with 5 mm 3-ma or 0.01 ␮m
bafilomycin for 3 days abolished
fccp-induced ca2⫹ release. short
(1 h) exposure to either drug did not
decrease the mitochondrial ability
to release ca2⫹ (fig. 4b). similar
results were obtained with nigericin
or ammonium chloride used as lyso-
somal inhibitors (data not shown).
these data demonstrate that inhib-
iting lysosomal
function and/or
impairs mito-
autophagocytosis
chondrial ca2⫹
accumulation.
therefore,
lysosomal
function in mliv and mliii leads
to accumulation of dysfunctional
mitochondria, which are unable to
efficiently
cytoplasmic
ca2⫹. although a prolonged treat-
ment of the cells with these com-
pounds may have nonspecific effects, it should be noted that
such treatments did not have a noticeable effect on bk-induced
ca2⫹ signal but resulted in a specific mitochondrial phenotype
that recapitulates mitochondrial abnormalities detected in
mliv and mliii.

0.05) in mliv fibroblasts, a statisti-
cally significant difference (fig. 5a).
a similar response was observed
using the dapi and tunel assays
(fig. 5a). these data indicate
increased sensitivity of mliv fibro-
blasts to apoptotic stimuli brought
about by ca2⫹-mobilizing agonists.
mliii fibroblasts were also more
sensitive to bk-induced apoptosis
than were mliii-control cells (fig.
5b). it was only after a 16-h expo-
sure to bk that apoptosis rates in
control cells approached the levels
detected in lsds.
two lines of experiments con-
firmed that bk-induced apoptosis in
lsd-affected cells is mediated by
ca2⫹. first, thapsigargin, a plant
alkaloid that blocks endoplasmic
reticulum ca2⫹ pump and thus
releases the ca2⫹ stored in the
reticulum without
endoplasmic
activating phospholipase c (54), also induced apoptosis in
mliv, but not in mliv-control fibroblasts (fig. 5c). second,
bk-induced apoptosis was abolished by incubating the cells
with a cell-permeable form of the ca2⫹ chelator bapta,
bapta-am (fig. 5d). at a 30 ␮m concentration, bapta-am
inhibited bk-induced ca2⫹ transients and bk-induced apopto-
sis in mliv fibroblasts. in two separate experiments, stimula-
tion of mliv fibroblasts with bk for 1 h increased apoptosis
from 5.5 ⫾ 1.6% (n ⫽ 10) to 18.0 ⫾ 6.6% (n ⫽ 10, p ⬍ 0.05) in the
absence of bapta-am, whereas in the presence of bapta-
am, apoptosis increased from 3.2 ⫾ 1.8% (n ⫽ 10) only to 4.5 ⫾
2.0% (n ⫽ 10, not significant) as determined by annexin v assay.
staurosporin (sta), is known to enhance the rate of ca2⫹-
induced apoptosis by inhibiting protein kinase c, a regulator of
ca2⫹ signals (55, 56). we found that similar to bk-stimulated
cells, apoptotic rates are higher in mliv fibroblasts treated
with 0.1 ␮m sta than in sta-treated mliv-control fibroblasts
(see fig. 7a) as determined by dapi staining.
to test whether the cell stress induced by ca2⫹ stimulation
involves liberation of cytc from mitochondria and apoptosis
by a caspase-9-dependent scenario, we stained untreated and
stimulated cells with antibodies specific to the native form of
cytc (clone 6h2) and analyzed their cellular localization in
control and treated cells. the cells were incubated with the
drugs for 1–3 h, and cytc translocation was surveyed using
confocal immunocytochemistry. neither bk nor 0.l ␮m sta
caused a noticeable change in the cytc localization pattern
(fig. 6a). at the same time, 0.25 mm h2o2, which is used to
induce apoptosis by liberating cytc, changed cytc appearance
from the highly compartmentalized pattern detected in
figure 5. apoptosis in control, mliv, and mliii fibroblasts induced by ca2ⴙ-mobilizing agonists.

apoptosis—mitochondria are major players in apoptosis
because they release cytochrome c (cytc) that triggers the
caspase-9-dependent branch of apoptosis and because their
ca2⫹-buffering function regulates apoptotic events triggered
by ca2⫹ (49–51). bearing this in mind, we tested whether
decreased mitochondrial ca2⫹ buffering function in mliv
translates into increased cell death rates for cells stimulated
with ca2⫹-mobilizing agonists. apoptosis rates were estimated
using three different apoptosis markers: nuclear morphology
visualized using dapi stain, phosphatidylserine translocation
to the outer layer of the plasma membrane visualized using
fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin v, and dna
fragmentation visualized using tunel assays. the stained
cells were analyzed using either a fluorescence imaging system
or a confocal microscope; the percentage of apoptotic cells was
calculated as the ratio of cells displaying apoptotic characteris-
tics to the total number of cells in the field of view. five to seven
images were taken in each trial with 5–25 cells each.
in the first set of assays, mliv-control and mliv fibroblasts
were stimulated with 1 ␮m bk for 1–16 h and assayed for apo-
ptosis rates. there was some degree of variability to the exact
values yielded by these assays, which has been previously
observed (52, 53). nonetheless, the three assays demonstrated
the same trend: under control conditions, the percentage of
mliv cells undergoing apoptosis was not statistically different
from mliv-control fibroblasts (fig. 5a). however, when stim-
ulated with 1 ␮m bk for 1–3 h, mliv fibroblasts showed dra-
matically increased apoptosis rates as compared with control
cells (fig. 5a). specifically, in annexin v assays, 2–4% of
untreated mliv-control and mliv fibroblasts displayed apo-

fluorogenic substrate of caspase-8,
z-ietd-afc. its fluorescent group,
afc, is quenched until the polypep-
tide is cleaved by caspase-8 (35).
after the cleavage, the fluorescent
group can be excited by 400-nm
light to emit at 505 nm. the net flu-
orescence can be used to estimate
caspase-8 activity in a given sample.
to compare caspase-8 activity using
this assay, untreated and bk-stimu-
lated mliv-control and mliv
fibroblasts were homogenized, and
the protein loads were normalized
between the samples. fluorescence
readings were taken before and 30
min after the addition of the fluoro-
genic substrate. four independent
experiments showed an increase in
fluorescence in bk-treated mliv
cells, which was significantly higher
than that detected in bk-treated
mliv-control cells (fig. 7b). there-
fore, we conclude that ca2⫹ stimulation activates caspase-8 in
mliv fibroblasts.
although the 0.1 ␮m sta elicited caspase-8-dependent apo-
ptosis in these cells, higher concentrations of sta (1 ␮m) are
typically used to induce apoptosis by a caspase-9-dependent
pathway. at this higher dose, sta-induced cell death rates were
essentially the same in mliv-control and mliv fibroblasts
(65.0 ⫾ 6.1% and 69.1 ⫾ 5.4%, respectively, n ⫽ 3 independent
experiments). thus, the enhanced sensitivity of mliv fibroblasts
is specifically manifested through ca2⫹-induced, caspase-8-
dependent pathways rather than via oxidative stress- or caspase-
9-dependent pathways.
discussion
mechanisms of cell death in lsds are not well understood,
and the lack of a mliv mouse model impedes elucidation of the
pathways that lead to cellular death in this disease. although
psychomotor retardation is a major consequence of mliv,
trp-ml1 is ubiquitously expressed, and the degenerative pro-
cesses are not limited to the brain but are also documented in
cornea, retina, skeletal muscles, pituitary gland, and other tis-
sues (11, 16, 57). indeed corneal opacification and retinal
degeneration are often the presenting symptoms. given the
similarity between fibroblasts and corneal keratinocytes and
the availability of fibroblasts isolated from patients with muco-
lipodoses, we selected these cells as an initial model system to
dissect mechanisms of cell death in mliv.
we found that mitochondria in mliv fibroblasts are frag-
mented and hampered in ca2⫹ buffering capacity. because
mliv is a lysosomal storage disease, we suggested that these
aberrations were due to inefficient autophagocytosis and recy-
cling of effete mitochondria (19, 23). our idea is supported by
the fact that every aspect of the mitochondrial phenotype
observed in mliv fibroblasts has been observed in three unre-
lated lysosomal storage disease systems (mliii, mlii, and

untreated cells to a smooth stain pattern associated with cyto-
plasmic localization of cytc (fig. 6a). high concentrations of
sta also changed the cytc localization pattern (not shown).
similar results were obtained using western blotting analysis
of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial cytc. untreated and stimu-
lated mliv-control and mliv fibroblasts were homogenized,
and unbroken cells and nuclei were separated by centrifugation
at 700 ⫻ g in the presence of protease inhibitors. the mitochon-
drial fraction was then isolated by centrifugation at 5,000 ⫻ g,
and mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed
using sds-page and western blotting with cytc antibodies
(clone 6h2). fig. 6b shows that h2o2 increased the levels of
cytc in cytoplasm of mliv cells, whereas bk-induced cytc
translocation was less pronounced.
it is important to note that h2o2 is equally efficient in induc-
ing apoptosis in mliv-control, mliii-control, mlivl, and
mliii fibroblasts (fig. 6c). therefore, oxidative stress- and
ca2⫹-induced cell death likely involves different pathways in
our system, and the consequences of altered mitochondrial
morphology specifically impact survival-death mechanisms
involving ca2⫹ buffering.
the mechanism of cell death was further probed using
caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 inhibitors and fluorogenic substrates.
our assumption was that if the cell death pathway triggered by
bk and sta is, indeed, apoptosis, it should be sensitive to the
inhibitors of the downstream executioner caspase-3. this idea
proved to be correct. pretreatment of cells with cell-permeable
caspase-3 inhibitor abolished bk- and sta-induced apoptosis in
both mliv-control and mliv fibroblasts (fig. 7a). impor-
tantly, both bk- and 0.1 ␮m sta-induced apoptotic responses
were also abolished by inhibition of caspase-8, suggesting that a
caspase-8-dependent mechanism mediates ca2⫹-induced cell
death in mliv fibroblasts.
to further confirm the involvement of caspase-8 in apoptosis
induced by ca2⫹ stimulation of mliv fibroblasts, we used a

figure 7. mechanisms of apoptosis in control and mliv fibroblasts.
a, analysis of 1 ␮m bk- and 0.1 ␮m sta-induced apoptosis under control con-
ditions or under conditions of caspase-3/7, -8, or -9 inhibition. the cells were
pretreated with caspase-3/7 (30 ␮m), caspase-8 (20 ␮m), or caspase-9 (20 ␮m)
cell-permeable inhibitors at 37 °c for 30 min before treatment with apoptosis
stimulus. it is evident that inhibition of caspase-9 has no effect on the rate of
apoptosis when cells are stimulated with ca2⫹-releasing agonists and can be
excluded as the caspase that mediates ca2⫹-induced apoptosis in mliv cells.
the results are representative of five experiments; *, p ⬍ 0.05 within group.

cln2). furthermore, control fibroblasts express similar mito-
chondrial dysmorphology and corrupted function when auto-
phagocytosis or lysosomal function is inhibited. thus, we estab-
lished a lysosomal-mitochondrial connection in mliv, and
possibly, in other lysosomal storage diseases: depressed lysoso-
mal function inhibits autophagic turnover of aged and/or dam-
aged mitochondria, which in turn results in accumulation of
dysfunctional mitochondria and increased susceptibility to
ca2⫹ toxicity.
it is possible that accumulation of short, fragmented mito-
chondria could result from the failure of mitochondria to fuse
(24), potentially related to lipid deficiencies in cells affected by
mliv. on the other hand, the similarity between our system
and the aged post-mitotic cells with lipofuscin accumulation as
well as the fact that mitochondrial fragmentation can be repro-
duced in control cells by lysosomal or autophagy inhibitors sup-
port our interpretation that mitochondrial abnormalities
detected in our system are the result of inhibited autophagocy-
tosis of effete mitochondria.
additional data further implicate abnormalities in autoph-
agy in mliv fibroblasts. autophagy can be monitored by the
redistribution of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3
(lc3, also known as autophagy gene 8, atg8) from a perinuclear
position to the nascent autophagosome membrane (58–60).
we used immunofluorescence to study the dynamics of lc3
translocation in untreated, starved, and refed cells. in our
experiments, lc3-positive immunofluorescence was primarily
located in the perinuclear area of untreated mliv and mliv-
control cells (supplemental fig. s1, left column). a 1-h starva-
tion induced translocation of lc3-positive stain into cyto-
plasm, where it was associated with numerous puncta,
presumably autophagosomes (supplemental fig. s1, middle
column). refeeding control fibroblasts for 3 h restored perinu-
clear lc3 localization. at the same time, clumps of lc3 stain
were retained in the cytoplasm of refed mliv fibroblasts (sup-
plemental fig. s1, right column). these results suggest that
although autophagic sequestration commences normally in
both mliv and mliv-control fibroblasts, completion of the
degradation process is impaired/delayed in mliv fibroblasts.
another autophagy marker, mdc (61) confirmed this trend.
nearly all mliv-control cells and a majority of untreated mliv
cells displayed smooth cytoplasmic mdc signals (supplemen-
tal fig. s2, left column). however, a large fraction of mliv
fibroblasts showed punctate mdc localization similar to that
shown in the middle column in supplemental fig. s2. both star-
vation and mitochondrial damage induce the transformation of
mdc stain into a punctate morphology shown to be associated
with autophagosomes (61, 62). in our system starvation elicits
punctate mdc staining (supplemental fig. s2, middle column).
the punctate mdc stain was completely abolished by refeed-
ing of mliv-control fibroblasts but was largely retained in
refed mliv fibroblasts (supplemental fig. s2, right column).
again, generation of autophagosomes seems to commence at
similar rates after starvation in both mliv and mliv-control
cells, but completion of autophagy seems to be delayed in mliv
cells. these data further support the model that abnormal auto-
phagy in mliv contributes to accumulation of dysfunctional
mitochondria.
mitochondria are well known to regulate apoptosis by buff-
ering ca2⫹ and by releasing cytc. one of the better known
connections between mitochondria, apoptosis, and ca2⫹ has
been documented in neurons, where it has been convincingly
shown that mitochondrial ca2⫹ overload during prolonged
ca2⫹ stimulation destabilizes mitochondrial membranes and
releases cytc (reviewed in ref. 63). in fact, inhibition of mito-
chondrial ca2⫹ uptake by fccp has been shown to have a neu-
roprotective effect (64). our results prompt a complimentary
model, in which pro-apoptotic effects of ca2⫹ may also manifest
under conditions of suppressed ca2⫹ uptake by mitochondria.
interestingly, although the cell death induced by mitochondrial
ca2⫹ overload involves the “intrinsic,” caspase-9-dependent path-

way (63), we found that the caspase-8-dependent pathway exe-
cutes ca2⫹-dependent apoptosis in the fibroblasts of mliv
patients. based on the fact that mitochondria in cells affected by
lsds are deficient in ca2⫹ uptake function, we hypothesize
that in this situation, ca2⫹ exerts its pro-apoptotic effects in
the cytoplasm, perhaps in the immediate proximity of
mitochondria.
the perimitochondrial ca2⫹-sensitive elements that activate
caspase-8 in our system remain to be identified. however, this
is not an unprecedented suggestion; recently, it has been shown
that the ca2⫹-sensitive protease calpain-10 localizes to mito-
chondria (65). notably, calpain-cleaved forms of caspase-8 are
active, whereas calpain-cleaved caspase-9 is inactive (66),
which concurs with our findings that apoptosis induced in
mliv and mliii fibroblasts by bk involves caspase-8, not
caspase-9.
autophagosome-rich forms of cell death elicited by other
stimuli have also been reported to occur through caspase-8
rather than caspase-9-dependent pathways (67, 68). although
the term autophagic cell death or type ii programmed cell death
has been used to describe this morphology, it is controversial
whether the increased autophagy contributes to cell death or
represents a failed compensatory reaction (20–22, 69, 70).
to summarize, we observed a common mitochondrial phe-
notype in mliv, mliii, and other lsds, namely accumulation
of fragmented mitochondria with impaired calcium buffering
capacity. these changes could be recapitulated in control fibro-
blasts treated with inhibitors of autolysosomal degradation,
implicating a role for impaired recycling of effete mitochondria.
moreover, accumulation of abnormally fragmented mitochon-
dria was associated with ineffective mitochondrial ca2⫹ home-
ostasis and increased susceptibility to apoptosis induced by
ca2⫹ mobilizing agents. in particular, a pathway of caspase-8-
dependent apoptosis is implicated in degenerative cell death
associated with mliv.
