role of autophagy in cancer
robin mathew, vassiliki karantza-wadsworth and eileen white
abstract | autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway for the clearance of 
damaged or superfluous proteins and organelles. the recycling of these intracellular 
constituents also serves as an alternative energy source during periods of metabolic 
stress to maintain homeostasis and viability. in tumour cells with defects in 
apoptosis, autophagy allows prolonged survival. paradoxically, autophagy defects 
are associated with increased tumorigenesis, but the mechanism behind this has 
not been determined. recent evidence suggests that autophagy provides a 
protective function to limit tumour necrosis and inflammation, and to mitigate 
genome damage in tumour cells in response to metabolic stress.
autophagy is a cellular catabolic degradation 
response to starvation or stress whereby 
cellular proteins, organelles and cytoplasm 
are engulfed, digested and recycled to sustain 
cellular metabolism1,2. constitutive, basal 
autophagy also has an important homeostatic 
function, maintaining protein and organelle 
quality control, acting in parallel with the 
ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway 
to prevent the accumulation of polyubiquiti-
nated and aggregated proteins3–8. autophagy 
is also a pathway that is used for the elimina-
tion of pathogens9 and for the engulfment of 
apoptotic cells10. however, the effect of these 
events on cancer is not known. although 
most evidence supports a role for autophagy 
in sustaining cell survival, paradoxically, cell 
death resulting from progressive cellular con-
sumption has been attributed to unrestrained 
autophagy11–13. 
complicating this situation further, 
cytotoxic events often induce autophagy, 
but whether this is a death mechanism or a 
futile effort at cellular preservation is often 
unclear2. another enigma has been the role 
of autophagy in tumour suppression; allelic 
loss of the essential autophagy gene beclin1 
(becn1, also known as atg6) is found with 
high frequency in human breast, ovarian and 
prostate cancers14,15, and autophagy-defective 
becn1-heterozygous16,17 and autophagy-
related 4c (atg4c)-deficient18 mice are prone 
to tumours. paradoxically, most evidence 
supports a role for autophagy in maintaining 
tumour cell survival in response to metabolic 
stress in vitro, and in hypoxic tumour regions 
in vivo19–23. resolution of these paradoxes 
surrounding autophagy function has proved 
challenging.
the mechanisms that regulate the 
mutually opposed survival-supporting and 
death-promoting roles for autophagy are still 
far from resolution. the most plausible expla-
nation is that catabolism through autophagy 
is predominantly survival-supporting, but 
that an imbalance in cell metabolism, where 
autophagic cellular consumption exceeds the 
cellular capacity for synthesis, promotes cell 
death. although experimental evidence to 
support this is currently lacking, insight into 
the role of autophagy in tumour suppression 
is beginning to evolve.
how loss of the pro-survival function of 
autophagy promotes tumorigenesis is partly 
explained by the stimulation of necrotic 
cell death and an inflammatory response 
in tumours with defects in autophagy and 
apoptosis19. preventing survival under 
starvation through autophagy, and divert-
ing apoptosis-defective tumour cells to 
a necrotic cell fate, generates chronically 
necrotic tumours. this can corrupt a normal 
wound-healing response to support tumour 
growth, representing a possible means by 
which autophagy defects provide a non-cell-
autonomous mechanism for stimulating 
tumorigenesis24–26. in contrast to apoptosis, 
necrosis and cell lysis causes nuclear hmgb1 
to be released from cells, and this and 
other events stimulate the innate immune 
response, the recruitment of inflammatory 
cells, cytokine production and nuclear factor-
κb (nfκb) activation, which in some cases 
is linked to increased tumorigenesis27–29. 
indeed, blocking autophagy with constitutive 
activation of akt in apoptosis-defective cells 
results in necrosis in response to metabolic 
stress in vitro, and in tumours in vivo this 
necrosis is coincident with nf-κb activation 
and promotion of tumorigenesis19. how 
different cell-death processes interface with 
the immune system and tumour micro-
environment to modulate tumour growth is 
far from clear and is an important area for 
future investigation.
how defective autophagy and com-
promised survival to stress can promote 
tumour progression despite reduced cellular 
fitness is suggested by the increased rate of 
cellular damage accumulation. in tumour 
cells in which cell-cycle checkpoints are 
inactivated, autophagy limits the accumula-
tion of genome damage and suppresses the 
mutation rate20,23. this supports the role 
for autophagy in protecting the genome in 
a cell-autonomous mechanism of tumour 
suppression. it is currently unclear how 
autophagy limits genome damage, but this 
could involve maintaining energy homeo-
stasis or preventing the damaging effects of 
oxidative stress from defective organelle and 
unfolded protein accumulation. as we begin 
to define the role of tumour cell metabolism 
in response to stress, the rational ability to 
modulate the autophagy pathway in cancer 
therapy is emerging.
apoptosis and metabolic stress
a common cellular response to metabolic 
stress is cell death by apoptosis, and in 
tumour cells in particular this apoptosis 
is crucial to suppressing tumorigenesis30 
(fig. 1a). the tumour-suppressive role for 
apoptosis is well known, originating with the 
realization that many tumours have apoptosis 
suppressed by various mechanisms, including 
overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor 
bcl2, and that preventing apoptotic cell 
death allows tumour cells to survive the 
stress of oncogene activation, uncontrolled 
proliferation (fig. 2a) and chemotherapy31.

figure 1 |	altered	capacity	for	apoptosis	and	autophagy	can	dictate	cell	fate	in	response	to	
metabolic	stress.	a	| apoptosis is a common response to metabolic stress in which cells activate 
caspases and die efficiently. for immortal epithelial cells, metabolic stress triggers apoptosis within 
24 to 48 hours19,20,23. execution of apoptosis occurs in less than an hour and cell viability loss is five 
to six orders of magnitude19. b	| defective autophagy (through loss of becn1 or atg5, for example) 
can increase apoptotic cell death in some cells in response to metabolic stress56. in human mammary 
cells in 3d culture in vitro, this accelerated apoptosis manifests as increased lumen formation in 
mammary acini 20. therefore, preservation of cell metabolism through autophagy might increase 
the threshold for apoptosis activation. c	| in cells with defects in apoptosis, survival in metabolic 
stress is dependent on autophagy and is prolonged for weeks19,20,22,23. during the maintenance phase, 
activities such as cell division and motility are sustained. prolonged starvation and progressive 
autophagy causes cells to gradually shrink in size but restoration of nutrients allows recovery. in the 
preservation phase, cell division and motility decrease, presumably as a bioenergenic conservation 
effort, creating the minimal cell that is capable of recovery (mccr). eventually, restoration of nutrients 
fails to allow recovery. in this way, autophagy can be viewed as an interruptible path to cell death. 
d	| cells with defects in apoptosis and autophagy fail to tolerate metabolic stress, undergo metabolic 
catastrophe and die by necrosis36.
indeed, bcl2 antagonists have entered 
the clinic as part of the armamentarium to 
functionally restore the apoptotic pathway 
to resistant tumours32.
there is an entire family of multidomain 
(bcl2 homology regions or bh1–4) anti-
apoptotic bcl2-homologous proteins that 
function to sequester the core pro-apoptotic 
regulators, multidomain bax and bak31. 
pro-apoptotic bh3-only proteins disrupt this 
bax and bak antagonism by bcl2-like pro-
teins and some might directly activate bax 
and bak to propagate the death signal. once 
activated, bax and bak oligomerize and 
permeabilize membranes, particularly the 
outer mitochondrial membrane, to release 
pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c 
and smac/diablo. cytochrome c is a 
cofactor for the apoptosome that activates the 
cysteine protease caspase 9, whereas smac/
diablo inhibits the caspase antagonists, 
the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (iaps). 
together, this results in effector caspase 
activation and widespread cellular protein 
substrate cleavage, causing cell death31.
exactly how metabolic stress triggers 
apoptosis is not completely understood, 
but it is associated with the induction of the 
pro-apoptotic bh3-only protein puma, 
requires the bh3-only protein bim, depends 
on either bax or bak, and is inhibited by 
bcl2 (refs 30,33,34). once the apoptotic 
signal reaches bax and bak, mitochondrial 
membrane permeabilization, caspase activa-
tion and cell death occur in less than an 
hour and the process is extremely efficient 
and irreversible (fig. 1a). neighbouring cells 
or professional phagocytes engulf apoptotic 
cells, preventing the activation of an innate 
inflammatory response. these attributes 
are the reasons why apoptosis defects are 
selected for in tumours and why restor-
ing the apoptotic response is desirable for 
cancer therapy. tumour cells with defects 
in apoptosis through either deficiency in 
bax and bak or gain of bcl2 or bcl-xl 
(also known as bcl2l1) function are highly 
resistant to metabolic stress and the proper-
ties of these ‘undead cells’ are revealing 
insights into the mechanisms regulating 
metabolic stress response.
metabolic stress has a major influence 
on tumours in vivo, either as a stimulator of 
apoptosis to limit tumour progression, or as 
a damaging insult in surviving apoptosis-
defective tumour cells (figs 1c, 2a). tumours 
are frequently subjected to metabolic stress, 
arising from the initial lack of a blood supply, 
vascular collapse in established tumours or 
therapeutic intervention. it is well known 
that tumour cells can be reliant on the inef-
ficient process of glycolysis, rather than the 
more productive energy-generating process 
of oxidative phosphorylation, to support 
metabolism (the warburg effect)35. as such, 
tumour cells are particularly vulnerable to 
metabolic stress, which is only exacerbated 
by the high energy demand of unrestrained 
cell growth and the potentially reduced 
capacity to access the nutrient recycling 
activity provided by autophagy36. how 
apoptosis-defective tumour cells adapt to 
metabolic stress and if or how this facilitates 
tumour progression has now been linked to 
autophagy.
autophagy promotes survival 
evidence suggests that a constitutive, low 
level of basal autophagy in normal tissues 
provides an important homeostatic, 
housekeeping function. targeted deletion 
of atg5 or atg7 in the brain causes the 
accumulation of polyubiquitylated protein 
aggregates and neuronal degeneration, 
supporting a role for autophagy in protein 
quality control3,4. furthermore, atg5 is 
required for maintaining t-cell survival 
and proliferation37. autophagy induction in 
response to stress and starvation also has 
962 | december 2007 | volume 7 
	www.nature.com/reviews/cancer
© 2007 nature publishing group  
a crucial role in normal cells. for example, 
atg5-deficient mice fail to live through the 
neonatal survival period, during which 
tissues show signs of amino-acid deple-
tion and metabolic insufficiency38. these 
findings support a prosurvival role for 
autophagy in both normal tissues and in 
response to metabolic stress.
in cancer cells, metabolic stress robustly 
induces autophagy, which is sustained when 
apoptosis is blocked19,20,22,23. importantly, 
autophagy is required for tumour cells to 
survive metabolic stress. genetic inactivation 
of autophagy, either indirectly by constitu-
tive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (pi3k) pathway or directly by 
allelic loss of becn1 or deficiency in atg5, 
or by rna interference (rnai), prevents 
survival in response to metabolic deprivation 
even when apoptosis is inactivated19,20,22,23. 
presumably, in the absence of an external 
nutrient source the catabolic capacity of 
autophagy can sustain viability, but the role 
of autophagy in cell damage control and miti-
gation in response to stress may be equally 
important. amino-acid starvation, glucose 
and oxygen deprivation, growth-factor 
withdrawal and cytotoxic cellular damage are 
among the many stimuli that potently induce 
autophagy2. in the example of nutrient star-
vation, autophagy serves as a back-up energy 
reserve, whereas the autophagic response 
to cellular damage probably facilitates 
adaptation through the removal of damaged 
proteins and organelles.
autophagy regulation
autophagy is controlled mainly, but not 
exclusively, by the kinase mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mtor; also known 
as frap1), which is a downstream com-
ponent of the pi3k pathway2,39. mtor 
functions in part to suppress autophagy 
in response to nutrient and growth-factor 
availability. conditions of starvation cause 
the de-repression of autophagy, which 
initiates isolation membrane or phagophore 
formation and the subsequent genesis of 
autophagosomes. autophagosomes are 
double-membrane vesicles that sequester 
cytoplasm and organelles. the autophagy-
regulated or atg proteins are required for 
the activation of autophagy, the formation 
of autophagosomes, the sequestration of 
intracellular constituents, and the targeting 
and fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes 
where the contents are degraded and recy-
cled39–41. for example, the serine/threonine 
protein kinase atg1 (also known as ulk1) 
is a candidate for activation by mtor de-
repression that stimulates autophagy. atg5

events such as oncogene activation promote cell proliferation, but also apoptosis, which limits tumour

which can trigger autophagy-mediated survival in the most metabolically stressed tumour regions,

to contribute to tumour growth30. c	| in tumours formed by cells with defects in both apoptosis and 
autophagy, necrotic cell death is stimulated in metabolically stressed tumour regions and this

is required for autophagy and becomes 
covalently conjugated to the ubiquitin-like 
protein atg12 by the ubiqutin-activating 
enzyme atg7, but the specific role of this 
process in autophagy is not known. becn1 
is part of the class iii pi3k vps34 complex 
that is also required for autophagy. atg8 
(also known as map1lc3) is another 
ubiquitin-like protein that is cleaved, 
lipidated and becomes a component of the 
autophagosome membrane, and this mem-
brane translocation event is commonly used 
to monitor autophagy42,43.
the mechanics of phagophore and 
autophagosome formation and the recogni-
tion and capture of autophagosome cargo 
are presently unclear. autophagy may be 
a nonspecific, bulk degradation process 
in some situations, and in others it may 
be specific for targeting mitochondria44–46, 
catalase47, peroxisomes48–50, endoplasmic 
reticulum51, and aggregation-prone 
proteins and protein aggregates6–8,52–54 
for autophagy-mediated degradation. in 
the case of polyubiquitylated proteins, 
the multifunctional adaptor protein 
p62/sqstm1 might facilitate the specific 
autophagosome-targeting process53,55.  
if or how other aggregation-prone proteins, 
protein aggregates and organelles are 
recognized and targeted by the autophagy 
machinery is yet to be determined.
autophagy in cell survival or death
in cancer cells, autophagy can, in some 
situations, increase apoptotic20,56 (fig. 1b) 
and caspase-independent57 cell death. 
however, autophagy has a more prominent 
role in sustaining cell viability in cancer 
cells with defects in apoptosis19,20,22,23 (fig. 1c). 
apoptosis-defective tumour cells have the 
remarkable ability to tolerate long-term 
metabolic stress, either by cytokine depriva-
tion in dependent lymphoid cells22 or by 
oxygen (hypoxia) and glucose deprivation 
in epithelial cells19,20,23,30,33,34. although the 
absence of pro-apoptotic bax and bak or 
the gain of anti-apoptotic bcl2 or bcl-xl 
function adequately explains why cells fail to 
die when deprived, it is insufficient to explain 
how cell viability is maintained for weeks 
under the harsh metabolic stress conditions 
of nutrient deprivation in vitro and in vivo. it 
is now clear that surviving metabolic stress 
in vitro and in tumours in vivo is dependent 
on autophagy.

tumours that are reliant on autophagy to survive metabolic stress, autophagy inhibitors can be used 
to induce acute necrotic cell death that may be facilitated by proteasome inhibition, enabling tumour 
eradication. b	| in the adjuvant setting, and after elimination of a large proportion of the tumour by 
radiation and chemotherapy, the remaining cells can reside in a disrupted and stressed environment, 
susceptible to inhibition of the autophagy survival mechanism. tumour cells in the process of meta-
stasis can be similarly vulnerable. c	| autophagy stimulators may be therapeutically useful to either 
promote autophagic cell death or to prevent the damaging effects of autophagy deficiency and 
mismanagement of metabolic stress leading to dna damage and tumour progression. by limiting 
protein, organelle and ultimately dna damage, autophagy stimulators may suppress tumour progres-
sion. in human breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, where allelic loss of becn1 occurs with high 
frequency, correction of the autophagy deficiency with autophagy stimulators may delay tumour 
progression by reducing the rate at which tumour-promoting mutations accumulate.
the availability of cells with defects in 
apoptosis, with or without the capacity for 
autophagy (becn1+/+ or becn1 +/– and atg5+/+, 
atg5 +/– or atg5–/–) has allowed a prolonged 
evaluation of the cellular response to 
metabolic stress, the survival from which is 
autophagy-dependent. deprived epithelial 
and lymphoid cells using the autophagy sur-
vival function remain viable for weeks, during 
which time they undergo a dramatic decrease 
in cell size through progressive cellular con-
sumption19,20,22,23. although bcl2 localized 
to the endoplasmic reticulum can interact 
with becn1 and inhibit autophagy58, in the 
functional context in which the normally 
predominantly mitochondrial bcl2 blocks 
apoptosis and confers tumorigenic growth, 
autophagy is efficiently induced in response 
to metabolic stress19,20,23,30. it remains possible 
that the regulation of becn1 by bcl2 is 
more subtle or context-dependent.
it is clear from the analysis of time-lapse 
microscopy of apoptosis-defective immortal 
epithelial cells undergoing autophagy-mediated  
survival as a result of starvation that this 
is a complex, poorly characterized and 
prolonged process19,36. initially, autophagy 
supports the continuation of cell prolif-
eration under metabolic stress, which is 
consistent with a role for autophagy in the 
maintenance of homeostasis to support 
normal cell function during intermittent 
interruptions in nutrient availability (fig. 1c). 
this ‘maintenance phase’ might also be 
crucial for sustaining atp levels and cardiac 
function during the neonatal starvation 
period in mice38.
beyond two days of starvation cell divi-
sion ceases, cells shrink markedly (fig. 1c), 
motility is suppressed and cells aggregate into 
small clusters19,20,23,36. these aggregated clus-
ters of starved cells often show evidence of 
cells consuming other cells, or heterophagy, 
particularly when cells are in a confined 
space such as spheroid growth in matrigel20. 
whether these cells are dead or alive at the 
time of consumption or if the persistence 
of these corpses reflects degradation failure 
autophagy enables stress recovery
remarkably, autophagy affords cells a 
resilient capacity for regeneration, whereby 
restoration of nutrients results in an increase 
in cell size to that before starvation (fig. 1c) 
and resumption of cell proliferation19,22,36. 
this recovery process is rapid and efficient, 
and dramatically impaired by defects in 
autophagy (becn1+/– or atg5–/–). thus, 
autophagy-deficient cells not only fail to 
tolerate metabolic stress but are also defective 
in the recovery process23. mitigation of the 
damaging effects of stress, including damaged 
protein, dna and organelle accumulation 
during this phase is probably crucial for 
enabling recovery.
following prolonged starvation and pro-
gressive autophagy, what defines the minimal 
cell that is capable of recovery and what 
events eventually lead to cellular demise are 
currently unknown. this capacity for dura-
ble, long-term survival of metabolic stress 
through autophagy might be vital for the 
survival of tumour cells that remain viable 
following treatment, for metastatic tumour 
cells (fig. 3c) and possibly for stem cells. in 
cells using autophagy to survive metabolic 
stress there is a gradual erosion of cell viabil-
ity with time (fig. 1c), but whether this is due 
to autophagic cell death or eventual cellular 
attrition through atrophy is not clear. finally, 
the interaction of cells undergoing progres-
sive autophagy, either dead or alive, with the 
immune system is unknown.
autophagy and tumour dormancy
one of the most daunting clinical problems 
is the frequent re-emergence of tumours 
following treatment, often after prolonged 
dormancy59. how residual tumour cells 
cope with metabolic stress and remain 
viable yet dormant needs to be determined, 
as elimination of these tumour cells might 
be essential to achieving durable treatment 
responses. the survival of tumour cells 
through autophagy may be a key mechanism 
to enable long-term tumour-cell survival 
and eventual re-growth and relapse. thus, 
autophagy may allow residual or metasta-
sizing tumour cells to tolerate metabolic 
deprivation with the flexibility to recover

once growth conditions are favourable. this 
dramatic capacity for recovery afforded by 
autophagy vaguely resembles the process of 
sporulation in microorganisms, and its sup-
pression may be essential to achieve efficient 
cancer eradication.
metabolic stress and necrosis
inactivation of autophagy, either by allelic 
loss of becn1, deficiency in atg5, rnai 
knockdown of expression of essential 
autophagy regulators, or constitutive 
activation of the pi3k pathway and mtor-
mediated inhibition of autophagy, prevents 
cells surviving metabolic stress. in apoptosis-
defective cells this results in cell death by 
necrosis19 (fig. 1d). what specifically triggers 
necrosis is unknown, but insufficient atp 
production to maintain plasma-membrane 
integrity resulting in metabolic catastrophe 
and cell lysis is highly probable36. this is 
important because inhibition of autophagy 
is a means for sensitizing tumour cells to 
metabolic stress that is effective even in 
tumour cells with defects in apoptosis that 
would otherwise be difficult to eliminate36,60. 
although diverting apoptosis-defective 
tumour cells to a necrotic cell fate may not 
be a benign cell death61 (box 1), stimulation 
of acute necrotic cell death, if efficient 
enough, may be therapeutically useful 
(fig. 3a). indeed, the mechanism of cell death 
induction by alkylating agents involves 
poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) 
activation and atp consumption resulting 
in acute necrotic tumour cell death, which 
probably accounts for their success in the 
clinic62. combining autophagy inhibitors 
with metabolic stress conditions might be a 
similarly effective means of promoting acute 
necrotic tumour cell death.
autophagy and tumour suppression 
the role for autophagy as a survival mecha-
nism in normal cells and in tumour cells 
seems to contradict the observation that 
loss-of-function mutations in the autophagy 
pathway are associated with tumour pro-
gression14–17,19,20. furthermore, constitutive 
activation of the pi3k pathway is one of the 
most common events in human cancer63, 
and the downstream kinase mtor restricts 
autophagy induction in response to starva-
tion64. how loss of this autophagy-mediated 
survival pathway promotes tumorigenesis 
was initially difficult to reconcile; however, 
two non-mutually exclusive possibilities have 
emerged. one explanation is that stimula-
tion of necrotic cell death and inflammation 
caused by defects in apoptosis and autophagy 
provides a cell with non-autonomous means 
of tumour promotion through induction of a 
chronic wound-healing response19. another 
explanation is that proper management 
of metabolic stress through autophagy is 
required in tumour cells to suppress the 
accumulation of deleterious mutations, per-
haps caused by the increased oxidative stress 
that can drive tumour progression20,23,36. as 
such, overall cellular viability is compromised 
in tumour cells with defects in autophagy, but 
this initial disadvantage is overcome by an 
increased mutation rate resulting from failure 
of stress management in a cell-autonomous 
mechanism of tumour promotion. this 
is analogous to the mechanism by which 
defects in dna repair cause sensitivity to 
dna damage, yet the accelerated rate of 
mutation that results from deficient dna 
repair confers an increased incidence of 
tumour formation65.
autophagy limits genome damage
autophagy is required in stressed cells for 
maintaining protein and organelle quality 
control and energy homeostasis2. a pos-
sible reconciliation of the pro-survival and 
tumour suppression functions of autophagy 
is that some aspect of the mismanagement 
of metabolic stress in autophagy-deficient 
tumour cells leads to genome damage and 
tumour progression20,23,60,66. this could occur 
through protein, organelle and dna damage, 
or insufficient atp levels for essential cel-
lular functions that are required to maintain 
genome integrity, such as mitosis and dna 
replication and repair. this notion is sup-
ported by upregulation of the dna damage 
response, evidence of dna double-strand 
breaks, and aneuploidy in autophagy-defec-
tive immortal epithelial cells in association 
with increased tumorigenesis20,23 (fig. 2c). 
this genome damage is manifested most 
obviously in cells with a defect in apoptosis, 
which would otherwise eliminate most of 
these damaged, abnormal cells, and is prob-
ably also facilitated by cell-cycle checkpoint 
inactivation (immortalization through rb1 
and p53 loss). increased genome damage 
resulting from an autophagy defect, however, 
does not require a defect in apoptosis23, 
consistent with the tumour-prone state 
of becn1-heterozygous mutant mice that 
have the apoptotic response intact16,17. the 
origin of the increased dna damage in 
autophagy-defective cells is not yet known. 
malfunctioning organelles, accumulation of 
toxic protein aggregates, generation of reac-
tive oxygen species and oxidative stress, and 
failure of energy homeostasis are all potential 
contributors to induction of genome damage 
when autophagy is defective.
genetic instability and an enhanced muta-
tion rate promote tumour-cell evolution and 
adaptation to drive progression and resistance 
to therapy (fig. 2c). it is the rare, adapted, 
resistant tumour cells, which emerge typically 
following therapy, that are lethal. autophagy 
deficient, immortal epithelial cells show an 
increased rate of gene amplification20,23, the 
most common mechanism of oncogene 
activation in human tumours67, rendering 
this scenario plausible. cancer is a disease 
where it is often the case that what grows back 
kills you, and what grows back is a mutated 
and more aggressive version of the original 
tumour generated by mutation, selection 
and genome instability. despite the reduced 
cellular fitness caused by deficient autophagy, 
the poor survival but superior adaptation 
through an increased mutation rate might 
be the key advantage that promotes tumori-
genesis (fig. 2c). interestingly, autophagy is 
associated with longevity, suggesting a role 
in the suppression of ageing phenotypes68,69. 
as dna damage accelerates both cancer 
and ageing, this supports a general role for 
autophagy in protecting cellular and genome 
fitness to prevent cancer and extend lifespan.
 box 1 | necrotic cell death stimulates inflammation 
necrosis typically results from physical injury in which cell lysis and the release of intracellular 
contents, including hmgb1 (ref. 80), activate the innate immune system and a wound-healing 
response61. this recruitment of inflammatory cells provides cytokines, fostering cell growth to 
replace damaged tissue while removing cell debris24–26. once the tissue damage is repaired, the 
wound-healing response abates. tumours, however, often show persistent, chronic necrosis and 
inflammation in a corrupted version of a wound-healing response. necrotic tumours are 
associated with poor prognosis and the persistent inflammatory infiltration and cytokine 
production are thought to promote tumour growth81. a high proportion of tumours have 
constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway, which inhibits the induction 
of autophagy in response to metabolic stress, and many tumours also have defects in apoptosis. 
this generates a necrotic cell-death response to metabolic stress. a chronic necrotic response to 
persistent metabolic stress is created by rapid tumour growth and high metabolic demand that 
outpaces atp production by glycolysis, angiogenesis and nutrient availability. thus, a necrotic cell 
fate is a common event in tumorigenesis, and evidence suggests that this alters the tumour–
microenvironment interaction, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood.

autophagy inhibition in cancer therapy
the ability to inhibit autophagy and sensitize 
even apoptosis-resistant tumour cells to 
metabolic stress is a promising avenue for 
cancer therapy. as many current cancer 
therapies (angiogenesis and growth factor 
and receptor inhibitors, for example) inflict 
metabolic stress, to which tumours are par-
ticularly vulnerable because of high metabolic 
demand and reliance on glycolysis, autophagy 
inhibitors may be particularly useful (fig. 3a). 
even conventional surgery, radiation and 
chemotherapy disrupt tumour architecture 
and vascularization leaving any remaining 
tumour cells potentially susceptible to meta-
bolic stress and autophagy-inhibitory therapy 
(fig. 3b). furthermore, the process of cancer 
metastasis necessarily requires that tumour 
cells survive in isolation from the primary 
tumour, without its nutrient support system. 
this metastasis-prone state may be particu-
larly susceptible to autophagy inhibition as 
cells in isolation are expected to be more 
reliant on autophagy, although this remains to 
be investigated (fig. 3b). although inhibition 
of autophagy can promote apoptosis under 
nutrient-deprived conditions20,56, there is the 
advantage that this is also effective on tumour 
cells with defects in apoptosis through 
induction of acute necrotic cell death (fig. 3a). 
preclinical studies with chloroquine, which 
inhibits lysosome acidification and thereby 
autophagy, in conjunction with alkylating 
agents, showed remarkable efficacy inhibiting 
tumour growth in mice70. synergy between 
chloroquine and the hdac inhibitor saha 
in killing imatinib-refractory chronic myeloid 
leukaemia cells also indicates the protective 
role for autophagy, supporting the thera-
peutic use of autophagy inhibitors in cancer 
therapy71. development of specific inhibitors 
that target the autophagy pathway directly, 
such as inhibitors of the kinases atg1 and 
vps34, which positively regulate autophagy, 
warrant similar investigation.
another angle for the use of autophagy 
inhibitors is their potential synergy with 
proteasome inhibitors. protein turnover 
by lysosomal degradation through the 
autophagy pathway is functionally coupled 
to, and compensatory with, the ubiquitin-
mediated proteasome protein degradation 
pathway72–74. thus compromising both 
proteasome- and autophagy-mediated 
protein degradation may be a particularly 
lethal combination to tumour cells with a 
high metabolic rate or with increased suscep-
tibility to production of unfolded proteins, 
which is worth testing therapeutically (fig. 
3a). the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 
has the approval of the us food and drug 
966 | december 2007 | volume 7 
administration and shows efficacy in treating 
multiple myeloma75 and more proteasome 
inhibitors are in development that will enable 
testing of this possibility.
autophagy and chemoprevention
promoters of autophagy also have the poten-
tial for clinical benefit in the setting of cancer 
prevention. as autophagy is required for the 
effective management of metabolic stress, 
promoting autophagy through mtor inhibi-
tion, for example, might be expected to limit 
tumour progression (fig. 3c). this approach 
has shown promise in the treatment of degen-
erative disorders that are linked to aberrant 
protein accumulation, such as huntington’s 
disease, that is reliant on autophagy for the 
removal of aggregated mutant proteins74,76. 
whether autophagy stimulation can be used 
in individuals at risk to slow the progres-
sion of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, 
which have a high incidence of allelic loss of 
becn1, remains to be investigated. however, 
distinguishing the contribution of autophagy 
stimulation to tumour regression from the 
anti-proliferative effects of mtor inhibition 
will be essential for determining whether this 
is a valid approach.
therapeutic induction of autophagic cell 
death through over-stimulation of autophagy 
remains another means for tumour-cell 
elimination (fig. 3c). cytotoxic drug treat-
ment often triggers autophagy, particularly 
in apoptosis-defective cells, and the excessive 
cellular damage and attempt to remediate that 
damage through progressive autophagy can 
promote autophagic cell death77. to this end, 
a better understanding of the conditions that 
distinguish between the survival-supporting 
and death-promoting roles for autophagy 
will be necessary. furthermore, roles for 
autophagy, along with the elucidation of the 
signalling pathways that confer specificity 
to the autophagic response downstream of 
different stimuli, will be necessary to selec-
tively activate the specific and therapeutic 
response desired.
future directions
we are at the initial stages of understanding 
the complex interplay of autophagy and 
cancer, but it is clear that autophagy is deeply 
integrated into metabolism, stress response 
and cell-death pathways. these responses 
might vary with cell type and type of stress, 
and will undoubtedly reflect the nature of 
the mutational events that have occurred in 
the tumour cells, not only that of becn1 
and the pi3k pathway as described above, 
but also p53 status78,79. establishing the muta-
tional events and the order of those events 
with respect to mutational inactivation of the 
autophagy pathway in human tumours, and 
using mouse models of human cancers, may 
be informative. molecular markers for the 
functional capacity for autophagy in human 
tumours and their possible association 
with prognosis need to be established. the 
connection between the mismanagement 
of metabolic stress and the induction of 
genome damage in autophagy-deficient cells 
is important, but the origins of the dna dam-
age need to be identified. increased oxidative 
stress is a likely candidate, but whether this 
arises from protein or organelle malfunction 
or is a consequence of metabolic insufficiency 
remains to be investigated. existing therapies 
indirectly inflict metabolic stress, but how this 
is influenced by the competency of tumour 
cells for autophagy is not known. how 
autophagy is controlled and regulated, and 
the specificity that is associated with cellular 
consumption, requires investigation. it will be 
important to molecularly and biochemically 
characterize the minimal cells that are capable 
of recovery and their relationship to tumour 
dormancy, and to test the hypothesis that 
inhibition of autophagy can eliminate dor-
mant or residual tumour cells for therapeutic 
benefit. moreover, the possibility of activating 
autophagy to promote autophagic cell death 
or limit genome damage and progression in 
the setting of chemoprevention is intriguing. 
finally, the molecular events that characterize 
necrotic cell death and their consequences 
need to be identified. we are only beginning 
to understand the tumour–microenvironment 
interaction and its interface with the immune 
system, and it is clear that they are intimately 
intertwined with tumour cell metabolism, cell 
death mechanisms and the cellular response 
to stress.
