atg4c/autophagin-3 is a member of a family of cysteine pro-
teinases proposed to be involved in the processing and delipida-
tion of the mammalian orthologues of yeast atg8, an essential
component of an ubiquitin-like modification system required
for execution of autophagy. to date, the in vivo role of the dif-
ferent members of this family of proteinases remains unclear.
to gain further insights into the functional relevance of atg4
orthologues, we have generated mutant mice deficient in
atg4c/autophagin-3. these mice are viable and fertile and do
not display any obvious abnormalities, indicating that they are
able to develop the autophagic response required during the
early neonatal period. however, atg4cⴚ/ⴚ-starved mice show a
decreased autophagic activity in the diaphragm as assessed by
immunoblotting studies and by fluorescence microscopic anal-
ysis of samples from atg4cⴚ/ⴚ gfp-lc3 transgenic mice. in
addition, animals deficient in atg4c show an increased suscep-
tibility to develop fibrosarcomas induced by chemical carcino-
gens. based on these results, we propose that atg4c is not essen-
tial for autophagy development under normal conditions but is
required for a proper autophagic response under stressful con-
ditions such as prolonged starvation. we also propose that this
enzyme could play an in vivo role in events associated with
tumor progression.
the mechanisms responsible for delivering cytoplasmic
cargo to the lysosome are known collectively as autophagy and
play an important role in the maintenance of cell homeostasis
(1–4). this process has been observed in all eukaryotic cells,
indicating the widespread occurrence of this evolutionarily
conserved pathway. autophagy can be classified into at least
three different pathways; that is, macroautophagy, microauto-
phagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (4, 5). macroauto-
phagy is the major lysosomal route for the turnover of cytoplas-
mic components and will hereafter be referred as autophagy.
this process begins with a sequestration event consisting of an

engulfment of cytoplasmic constituents by a membrane sac,
called the isolation membrane. this structure results in a dou-
ble-membrane vesicle called the autophagosome, containing
bulk portions of cytoplasm, which eventually fuses with the
lysosome. finally, the inner membrane of the autophagosome
and its protein and organelle contents are degraded by lysoso-
mal hydrolases and recycled.
the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying
autophagy has considerably improved after the isolation and
characterization of autophagy-defective mutants in the yeast
saccharomyces cerevisiae (6–9). a series of elegant studies
directed to the functional characterization of these autophagy
mutants has revealed that two ubiquitin-like conjugation sys-
tems are required for yeast autophagy (10, 11). one of these two
systems requires the participation of atg8 synthesized as a pre-
cursor protein, which is cleaved after a gly residue by a cysteine
proteinase called atg4 (12–14). this gly terminal residue from
the modifier atg8 is also activated by atg7 (an ubiquitin-acti-
vating enzyme (e1)-like enzyme), but then the modifier protein
is transferred to atg3 (an ubiquitin carrier protein (e2)-like
enzyme) and finally conjugated with membrane-bound phos-
phatidylethanolamine through an amide bond (11). the com-
plex atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine is also deconjugated by
the proteinase atg4, leading to the release of atg8 from mem-
branes. this modification system is an essential component of
the membrane rearrangement dynamics taking place during
the formation of autophagosomes and execution of autophagy.
several studies have shown that these ubiquitin-like conjuga-
tion systems associated with autophagy are conserved in higher
eukaryotes (10, 15–18). thus, proteins structurally and func-
tionally related to the diverse yeast atg proteins have been
described in mammalian cells, and their roles in the process of
autophagy have been elucidated in some cases (15, 16, 19).
recently we have described and cloned the four human
orthologues of the yeast proteinase atg4 (20). these proteins
are members of the c-54 family of cysteine proteinases and
maintain a significant sequence similarity with yeast atg4.
human atg4 orthologues also exhibit the structural features
characteristic of the yeast proteinase including the catalytic
cys residue and its surrounding amino acid sequences. all of
these structural features are also absolutely conserved in the
amino acid sequence of the four murine orthologues of atg4
(20).

autophagy alterations and increased tumorigenesis in atg4cⴚ/ⴚ mice
the finding that the above-mentioned ubiquitin-like system
is composed of four proteinases that may target at least six
distinct substrates in mammals (lc3a, lc3b, lc3c, gate-
16, gabarap, and atg8l) (16, 21, 22) contrasts with the
simplified yeast system involving a single proteinase with a spe-
cific substrate and indicates that this conjugation system has
evolved to acquire a larger complexity during eukaryote evolu-
tion. several works have shed some light on the involvement of
atg4 orthologues in the c-terminal processing and phosphati-
dylethanolamine deconjugation of some of the atg8 mamma-
lian orthologues (22–24). however, to date the in vivo role of
the different members of this family of cysteine proteinases
remains to be characterized. similarly, it is unclear if the com-
plexity of mammalian atg4 orthologues and their putative sub-
strates simply derives from functional redundancy in this sys-
tem, as described for other protease families (25, 26), or by
contrast it corresponds to a different scenario in which some
components of this proteolytic system have evolved to accom-
plish other functions distinct from autophagy.
among the four mammalian atg4 orthologues, atg4c is the
most widely distributed in human tissues (20). on this basis
together with the fact that human atg4c is able to complement
the deficiency of atg4 in yeast, studies were undertaken to gen-
erate a murine model defective for the atg4c gene. in this work
we report the generation and phenotype analysis of mutant
mice deficient in this member of the atg4 family of cysteine
proteinases. we show that these mice exhibit a tissue-specific
decrease in autophagy in response to starvation, the main auto-
phagy-inducing stimulus in vivo. in addition, atg4c⫺/⫺ mice
also show a decreased locomotor activity after prolonged star-
vation that could be correlated with their tissue-specific
decrease in autophagic activity. finally, we describe studies of
cancer susceptibility in these mutant mice with the finding that
atg4c deficiency leads to an increased susceptibility to develop
fibrosarcomas induced by chemical carcinogens. based on
these results, we conclude that the activity of this enzyme is not
essential for a proper autophagic activity under normal circum-
stances but is required for an appropriate resistance to pro-
longed starvation in vivo. finally, we propose that atg4c could
be involved in events associated with tumor progression.
experimental procedures
targeting vector construction—a genomic dna clone was
isolated from a mouse 129-sv/j genomic dna library (strat-
agene, la jolla, ca), using a murine atg4c cdna fragment as
probe. the genomic organization was determined by restric-
tion analysis and subsequent subcloning of these fragments into
pbluescript or puc18. plasmid ppn2t-hgterm (kindly pro-
vided by dr. c. paszty, lawrence berkeley national laboratory,
berkeley, ca) containing the pgk-neo and two pgk-tk (thymi-
dine kinase) selection markers, was used to construct the atg4c
targeting vector. a 3.4-kb hindiii-bamhi fragment from the
5⬘-flanking region was used as the 5⬘-homologous region,
whereas a 4.7-kb ecori-hincii fragment containing exons 5
and 6 was used as the 3⬘-region of homology. the 2.4-kb neo
cassette was used as a positive marker and replaced a 10-kb
fragment containing exons 1–4 of the atg4c gene (fig. 1a).
generation of atg4c-deficient mice—the targeting vector
was linearized by digestion with noti, electroporated into hm1
embryonic stem cells, and selected for homologous recombina-
tion with g418 and ganciclovir. positive clones were screened
by southern blot after psti digestion of genomic dna and
probed with a radiolabeled 5⬘-external probe (fig. 1b). a 12-kb
fragment was detected from the wild-type allele, and an 8-kb
fragment was detected from the corresponding mutant allele.
the targeted embryonic stem cell clones were expanded and
subsequently injected into blastocysts to generate chimeras.
chimeric males were mated with c57bl/6 female mice, and the
offspring heterozygous for atg4c were used to generate
homozygous null mice.
in all experiments homozygous
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice and their corresponding wild-type mice were
littermates derived from interbreeding of heterozygotes with a
mixed background of c57bl6/129sv. in all cases mice geno-
types were determined by southern blot analysis of tail dna.
rt-pcr2—total rna was isolated from mouse tissues accord-
ing to the method of chomczynski and sacchi (27). about half of
theobtainedproductwasreverse-transcribedusingtherna-pcr
core kit威 from perkinelmer life sciences. a pcr reaction was
then performed with mouse atg4c-specific primers for 25
cycles of denaturation (94 °c, 20 s), annealing (62 °c, 20 s),
and extension (72 °c, 30 s). as a control, ␤-actin was pcr-
amplified from all samples under the same conditions.
immunoblotting—mice tissues were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen after extraction and were homogenized in a 20
mm tris buffer, ph 7.4, containing 150 mm nacl, 1% triton
x-100, 10 mm edta, and complete威 protease inhibitor mix-
ture (roche applied science). once homogenized, tissue
extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °c, and superna-
tants were collected. the protein concentration of the superna-
tant was evaluated by bicinchoninic acid technique (bca pro-
tein assay kit, pierce). 25 ␮g of protein sample was loaded on
13% sds-polyacrylamide gels. after electrophoresis, gels were
electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and then the fil-
ters were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in pbt (phos-
phate-buffered saline with 0.05% tween 20) and incubated with
primary antibodies in 5% bovine serum albumin in pbt. after
three washes with pbt, filters were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg at a 1:10,000 dilu-
tion in 1.5% milk in pbt and developed with a west pico
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (pierce). the antibodies
against atg4c, gate-16, gabarap, and lc3 were kindly
provided by dr. t. ueno (juntendo university, tokyo). the
antibodies against atg4a, atg4b, and atg4d were from abgene
(manchester, uk).
northern blot analysis—nylon filters containing 2 ␮g of
poly(a)⫹ rna of a wide variety of murine tissues were prehy-
bridized at 42 °c fo r 3 h in 50%formamide, 5⫻ saline/sodium

autophagy alterations and increased tumorigenesis in atg4cⴚ/ⴚ mice
gene expression was normalized to the mouse glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) gene using the mouse
gapd (gapdh) endogenous control (vic威/mgb probe,
primer ltd) taqman威 gene expression assay (applied biosys-
tems). relative expression of the distinct atg4 genes was calcu-
lated according to manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, atg4a,
atg4b, atg4c, and atg4d expression was normalized to glyc-
eraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
in wild-type or
atg4c⫺/⫺ derived samples using the following formula: the mean
values of 2⌬ctgene (atg4a, atg4b, atg4c, oratg4d) ⫺⌬ctgene (gapdh) for
three different wild-type animals were considered 100% for
each atg4 gene, and the same values for atg4c⫺/⫺ mice tis-
sues were referred to those values according to livak and
schmittgen (28).
quantitative analysis of gfp-lc3 dots—mutant mice defi-
cient in atg4c were crossed with transgenic mice overexpress-
ing gfp-lc3 that provide an efficient in vivo marker for auto-
phagy (29). to avoid autophagy induction, mice were perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer
(pbs), ph 7.4. tissues were harvested and further fixed with the
same fixative solution for at least 4 h followed by treatment with
15% sucrose in pbs for 4 h, and then with 30% sucrose solution
overnight. tissue samples were embedded in tissue-tek oct
compound (sakura finetechnical co. ltd., tokyo, japan) and
stored at ⫺70 °c. samples were then sectioned at 5-␮m of
thickness with cryostat (cm3050 s, leica, deerfield, il), air-
dried for 1 h, washed in pbs for 5 min, dried at room tempera-
ture for 30 min, and mounted with conventional anti-fading
medium. the number of gfp-lc3 dots was counted in five
independent visual fields from at least five independent mice in
each organ using a leica tcs sp2 aobs confocal fluorescence
microscope.
measurement of locomotor activity of mice—to monitor the
locomotor activity of mice, an actimeter (le 8811 motor activ-
ity monitor, letica, spain) was used. animals were placed alone
in plastic cages inside the actimeter, and cages were washed
between measurements to avoid possible alterations in mice
behavior. the movements of each animal were recorded during
10 min.
carcinogenesis protocols and analysis of tumors—mouse
experimentation was done in accordance with the guidelines of
the universidad de oviedo (spain), regarding the care and use
of laboratory animals. for methylcholanthrene (mca) chemi-
cal carcinogenesis, groups of mice were injected subcutane-
ously with a freshly prepared solution of mca in olive oil (100
mg in 100 ml per mouse). mice were weekly monitored for
tumor development over the course of 8–20 weeks. tumors
larger than 5 mm and showing progressive growth were
counted as positive and confirmed thereafter by histological
analysis. mice were sacrificed when they had an overt tumor
mass or they looked moribund. after conventional staining
with hematoxylin and eosin, cells were morphologically identi-
fied by an expert pathologist and counted with no previous
knowledge of mice phenotypes.
fibroblast extraction and culture—adult murine fibroblasts
were extracted from 12-week-old mice ears. ears were steril-
ized with ethanol, washed with pbs, and triturated with razor
blades. samples were then incubated with 600 ml of 4 mg/ml
collagenase d (roche applied science) and 4 mg/ml dispase ii
(roche applied science)
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem; invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °c and 5% co2.
after filtering and washing, 6 ml of dmem with 10% fetal
bovine serum (invitrogen), and 1% antimycotic-antibiotic
(invitrogen) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °c
and 5% co2. once extracted, cells were cultured in dmem con-
taining 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °c and 5% co2.
protein degradation assays—to label proteins, adult murine
fibroblasts were incubated at 37 °c for 48 h in complete fresh
dmem (sigma) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(invitrogen), 1% antimycotic-antibiotic (invitrogen) and with 5
␮ci/ml l-[3h]leucine (amersham biosciences). before the pro-
teolysis experiments were started, cells were washed once with
pbs containing 2 mm l-leucine and chased at 37 °c for 24 h in
complete dmem containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1%
antimycotic-antibiotic, and 2 mm l-leucine to eliminate short-
lived proteins. proteolysis experiments and measurements of
intracellular protein degradation were carried out as described
previously (30) using 3-methyladenine to specifically inhibit
autophagic degradation. protein degradation was analyzed 1 h
after the addition of the 3-methyladenine and for an additional
period of onl y 3 h toensure optimal inhibition and to avoid
possible secondary effects of the inhibitor. all experiments
were performed at least four times with duplicate samples and
using independent cell lines.
statistical analysis—all experimental data are reported as
the mean, and the error bars represent the experimental s.e.
statistical analysis were performed by the non-parametric stu-
dent’s t test excepting for mca-tumor induction statistical
analysis, which was evaluated using the kaplan-meier method
(31) and compared with the log-rank test. statistical analyses
were made using the prism program version 4.0 (graphpad
software, inc).
results
generation of atg4c-deficient mice—to examine the in vivo
function of atg4c, we generated mice with a targeted mutation
in the atg4c gene. a genomic clone encoding atg4c was
obtained from a mouse 129-sv/j genomic dna library and

autophagy alterations and increased tumorigenesis in atg4cⴚ/ⴚ mice
used for construction of the targeting vector (fig. 1a). this
vector was designed to allow the replacement of exons 1, 2, 3,
and 4 of the endogenous atg4c gene with a neo cassette (fig.
1a). the linearized targeting vector was electroporated into
hm-1 embryonic stem cells, and 4 clones that were positive for
homologous recombination were used to generate chimeric
founder mice. heterozygous mice from the f1 generation were
identified by southern blot analysis and then crossed to obtain
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 1b). rt-pcr analysis of total rna from
diverse tissues of wild-type and knock-out animals revealed
that the atg4c transcript was absent in atg4c⫺/⫺ mice (fig.
1c). the same negative results were obtained by immunoblot-
ting of these tissues (fig. 1d), confirming the generation of an
atg4c-null allele.
normal development and growth of atg4c⫺/⫺ mice—de-
spite the atg4c deficiency, mutant mice developed normally
with males and females being fertile. likewise, there were no
gross detectable differences between the growth curves of wild-
type and knock-out mice. in addition, the mutant mice showed
no overt phenotype, and their long-term survival rates were
indistinguishable from those of their wild-type littermates. his-
topathological analysis of diverse tissues from adult atg4c⫺/⫺
animals revealed no observable differences with wild-type tis-
sues (data not shown). similarly, plasma levels of amino acids
and major biochemical parameters (including glucose, choles-
terol, triglycerides, uric acid, creatine kinase, aldosterone, and
hepatic aminotransferases) were similar to the levels of their
wild-type littermates. taken together, these data demonstrate
that atg4c is dispensable for embryonic and adult mouse
development as well as for normal growth and fertility.
the above findings showing that the development of mice
deficient for atg4c is normal suggest that this protein is not
necessary for the induction of the requested level of autophagy
which has been proved to be essential for the viability of neo-
nate mice (32, 33). a functional redundancy in the atg4 family
of cysteine proteinases, which has been previously reported for
other protease families (25, 26, 34–36), could contribute to
explain this observation. to test this possibility, we examined
by northern blot analysis the expression profile of these genes
in a variety of mouse tissues including testis, spleen, kidney,
skeletal muscle, liver, lung, brain, and heart (fig. 2a). we
observed that the expression pattern of the four atg4 genes is
very similar in murine tissues. this could explain at least in part
the fact that the activity of atg4c is not essential to generate the
sufficient basal autophagy requested under normal circum-
stances in any of the tissues analyzed. given this overlapping
expression pattern in the atg4 gene family, we examined
whether the loss of atg4c activity in vivo could modulate the
levels of other atg4 cysteine proteinases. to test this hypothe-
sis, we first analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr the atg4a, atg4b,
and atg4d transcript levels in the livers of 48-h-starved
atg4c⫺/⫺ and atg4c⫹/⫹ mice. as shown in fig. 2b, a consist-
ent change in the relative expression levels of atg4 genes was
not detected. we next analyzed the protein levels of atg4a,
atg4b, and atg4d in atg4c⫺/⫺ and atg4c⫹/⫹ tissues. as
shown in fig. 2c and in agreement with our quantitative pcr
results, we did not observe any significant change in the protein
levels of the different atg4 enzymes in atg4c⫺/⫺ tissues.
finally, to evaluate a possible change in the subcellular distri-
bution of these proteins in the absence of atg4c, we analyzed
the localization of the other atg4 family members in atg4c⫺/⫺
cells, but we did not find any evidence supporting putative
changes in the distribution of these proteins (data not shown).
taken together, these results do not provide evidence for a
compensatory mechanism in atg4c-deficient mice.
atg4c gene disruption leads to a tissue-specific decrease of
autophagy in vivo—the fact that atg4c⫺/⫺ mice develop nor-
mally suggests that autophagy is not impaired in the absence of
atg4c. however, it should be emphasized that previous studies
with other mutant mice exhibiting reduced autophagic activity
have demonstrated that a decrease in this process is not neces-
sarily accompanied by perinatal lethality (37, 38).
to test the possibility that atg4c disruption leads to a
decrease in autophagy but not to its total impairment, we per-
formed immunoblotting studies in tissue extracts from mutant
and control mice fed ad libitum or after 24 h of starvation,
which has been shown to be the main stimulus for in vivo induc-
tion of autophagy (29). we focused on the analysis of the molec-
ular forms of lc3b (referred hereafter as lc3), gate-16, and
gabarap. these proteins are the major mammalian ortho-
logues of yeast atg8 detected in autophagosome membranes
(39). as shown in fig. 3, we were able to detect the lipidated
forms of lc3 and gate-16 in atg4c⫺/⫺ mice in the same
tissues as in wild-type animals, whereas we could not detect the
lipidated form of gabarap either in wild-type nor in
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice, demonstrating that atg4c activity is not essen-
tial for the processing of these proteins in vivo. however, we
observed that the ratio of lc3-ii/lc3-i, which has been widely
used as an indicator of autophagic activity, was significantly
decreased in the diaphragm muscle of starved atg4c⫺/⫺ mice
(fig. 3b). we also analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr the relative
expression level of the distinct atg4 cysteine proteinases in the
diaphragm with the finding of a high relative expression of
atg4c in this tissue (fig. 3c).
to confirm and extend these observations pointing to a tis-
sue-specific reduction of autophagic responses in atg4c⫺/⫺
mice, we crossed these mutant mice with those expressing the
transgene gfp-lc3 that provides an efficient in vivo marker for
autophagy (29, 37, 40, 41). fluorescence microscopic analysis of
diverse tissues revealed that the number of punctate gfp-lc3
structures is equivalent in tissues from non-starved wild-type
or atg4c⫺/⫺ mice (fig. 4). similarly, we were not able to detect
any significant change in the number of gfp-lc3 punctate
structures in the majority of tissues analyzed after 24 or 48 h of

autophagy alterations and increased tumorigenesis in atg4cⴚ/ⴚ mice
the observed reduced resistance to starvation of atg4c⫺/⫺
mice.
increased susceptibility of atg4c-deficient mice to mca-
induced fibrosarcomas—many works have analyzed the
putative correlations between the ability of cancer cells for
developing autophagy and their neoplasic potential (44–46).
the fact that beclin-1 haplo-deficient mice, which show a
decrease in autophagy, also exhibit a high incidence of spon-
taneous tumors supports the idea that an autophagy
decrease can confer an increased susceptibility to cancer (37,
38). on this basis and considering that atg4c⫺/⫺ disruption
leads to a decrease in autophagy under demanding condi-
tions, we were prompted to test the hypothesis that the
absence of this proteinase could be associated with an
increase in cancer susceptibility in these mutant mice.
because our first studies to examine this possibility indicated
that atg4c⫺/⫺ mice do not develop more spontaneous
tumors than their wild-type littermates (data not shown), we
next focused on the comparative analysis of the susceptibil-
ity of these mice to cancer induced by chemical carcinogens.
to this purpose, wild-type and atg4c mutant mice were
induced to develop fibrosarcomas using a carcinogenesis
protocol based on the intradermal injection of a single dose
of the carcinogen mca, as previously described (47, 48).
this chemical carcinogen promotes the transformation of
mesenchymal fibroblasts into fibrosarcomas. as shown in
fig. 6a, fibrosarcomas arose more rapidly and with a signif-
icantly higher incidence in atg4c⫺/⫺ mice than in wild-type
animals. these differences in number of
fibrosarcomas
between mutant mice and wild-type controls were statisti-
cally significant. histological analysis of fibrosarcomas gen-
erated in both wild-type and atg4c⫺/⫺ male mice revealed
that most of them (80%) were partially infiltrative grade i
fibrosarcomas (with absence of necrosis, undifferentiated,
and with 2 or 3 mitosis by each high magnification field), and
only exceptionally gave rise to more aggressive grade ii
tumors (fig. 6b). these results suggest that the absence of
atg4c does not influence the late stages of tumor develop-
ment in male mice.
to test the possibility that a decrease in autophagy due to
atg4c disruption leads to the higher incidence of fibrosar-
comas observed in mutant mice, we studied the autophagic
activity of adult murine fibroblasts, cells in which atg4c is
highly expressed (fig. 7a). for that purpose, we analyzed the
in vitro degradation of long-lived proteins in fibroblasts
derived from atg4c⫺/⫺ mice and their wild-type littermates.
as previously reported (30), we employed the autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine to measure the autophagy-medi-
ated proteolysis in cultured cells. as expected, atg4c⫺/⫺
fibroblasts did not show changes in protein degradation
under confluent growing in normal conditions (fig. 7b).
however, under
serum and amino acids deprivation,
atg4c⫺/⫺ cells showed a lower rate of 3-methyladenine sen-
sitive protein degradation, which represented autophagic
degradation, than the corresponding controls (fig. 7c). to
test if the observed reduction of autophagic degradation was
due to the lack of atg4c or to other causes, we transfected
atg4c⫺/⫺ cells with an eukaryotic expression vector con-
figure 5. locomotor activity analysis of atg4cⴚ/ⴚ and wild-type mice
after prolonged starvation. mice were placed in a plastic cage inside a pho-
tocell actimeter for 10 min in silence to monitor their locomotor activity. plas-
tic cages were washed between measurements to avoid possible alterations
in mice behavior. the activity counts registered by actimeter represent the
number of longitudinal movements of mice during the time of the analysis.
15 atg4c⫺/⫺ and 15 wild-type mice were used in this experiment for each
condition. the locomotor activity of animals fed ad libitum is represented by

starvation (fig. 4 and data not shown). however, in agreement
with our immunoblotting results, we could detect a clear
decrease in the number of gfp-lc3 punctate structures per
cell area unit in the diaphragms from 24-h-starved atg4c⫺/⫺
mice as compared with their wild-type littermates (fig. 4d).
although not statistically significant, the analysis of gfp-
lc3 distribution in the diaphragm reveals a clear trend
toward a reduction of autophagic activity in the diaphragm
of starved atg4c⫺/⫺ mice as compared with wild-type ani-
mals, thus confirming and extending the above immunoblot-
ting results.
atg4c gene disruption leads to reduced locomotor activ-
ity in response to starvation—in the course of the different
starvation treatments performed to induce autophagy, we
could observe a reduced resistance to prolonged starvation
in mice deficient in atg4c as compared with wild-type ani-
mals. in fact, mutant mice showed a less healthy appearance
and a reduced mobility than wild-type animals subjected to
the same conditions, and some of them even succumbed to
starvation after 48 h (data not shown). by contrast and as
previously reported (29), wild-type animals were able to
resist periods of 48 h of starvation. to further extend this
observation, we performed an analysis of the locomotor
activity of atg4c⫺/⫺ mice and their wild-type littermates fed
ad libitum or subjected to 48 h starvation using a photocell
actimeter, an apparatus that allows the recording of the
movements and crossings of mice (42, 43). as shown in fig.
5, the locomotor activity of non-starved atg4c⫺/⫺ mice was
similar to control mice. however, after prolonged starvation,
the locomotor activity of null mice was significantly reduced
as compared with wild-type animals. thus, it is tempting to
speculate that the diminished capacity of inducing autoph-
agy in diaphragm from atg4c⫺/⫺ mice leads to a reduced
resistance to starvation that results in a reduced mobility in
these mutant animals. nevertheless, we cannot rule out the
possibility that additional factors could contribute to explain

term survival rates indistinguish-
able from those of wild-type mice.
these observations suggest
that
atg4c gene disruption does not
impair the ability of cells to undergo
a proper autophagic response after
birth, which has been proven to be
essential for neonate viability.
to evaluate the involvement of
atg4c in the processing and delipi-
dation of atg8 orthologues in vivo,
we first performed immunoblot
analysis of their putative major
substrates lc3, gate-16,
and
gabarap. these studies revealed
that the lipidated forms of lc3 and
gate-16 were present
in the
majority of
the analyzed tissues
from both mutant and wild-type
animals at a similar extent, whereas
we could not detect the lipidated
form of gabarap in any of the tis-
sues analyzed. the absence of
gabarap lipidation even under
strong starvation conditions pro-
vides support to the idea that the
major physiological function of this
protein is not related to autophagic
degradation (49, 50). all these observations suggest that atg4c
is not essential for the processing or delipidation of atg8
orthologues. however, we found that under starvation con-
ditions, the lipidation status of lc3 in the diaphragm, a con-
tinuous energy-consuming muscle, was diminished in
mutant mice. this observation was confirmed by crossing
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice with transgenic mice overexpressing gfp-
lc3. atg4c⫺/⫺ mice showed a slight but significant decrease
in the number of gfp-lc3 punctate structures, which was
associated with a decrease in autophagy in diaphragm under
starvation conditions.
the fact that atg4c activity is not essential for the devel-
opment of autophagy under normal conditions might be
explained by a functional redundancy in the atg4 family of
cysteine proteinases, as previously reported for other pro-
teinase families from different catalytic classes (25, 35, 36,
51). our finding of a considerable overlapping in the tissue
distribution of the different mouse atg4 orthologues should
be consistent with the proposal of a functional redundancy
in the atg4 family of proteinases. however, despite this
apparent redundancy observed in the atg4 family, the find-
ing that autophagy is reduced after 24 h of starvation in
diaphragm from atg4c-deficient mice muscle suggests that
only under very demanding conditions, atg4c activity is
necessary for a proper autophagic response. likewise, the
reduced locomotor activity observed in atg4c⫺/⫺ mice after
prolonged starvation could be a consequence of the decrease
of autophagic activity in the diaphragm. further works
aimed to study metabolic and respiratory functions of

arrows indicate tumor cells that migrate through normal skin tissue.
taining the atg4c cdna and measured the autophagic activ-
ity of transfected cells under starvation conditions. as
shown in fig. 7d, the autophagic degradation levels of
atg4c-transfected mutant cells were comparable with those
obtained with control cells, indicating that the loss of atg4c
leads to a reduced autophagic degradation in vitro under
starvation conditions. taken together, these results support
the idea of a reduced capacity of atg4c⫺/⫺ cells to develop a
proper autophagic response under compromising condi-
tions. this fact could contribute to explaining the higher
incidence of
fibrosarcomas observed in null mice after
chemical carcinogen induction.
discussion
to date, the precise in vivo role of the four members of the
mammalian atg4 family of cysteine proteinases remains to
be characterized. so far, it is not known whether the exist-
ence of four mammalian orthologues of the yeast protease
atg4 corresponds to a functional redundancy or, by contrast,
the components of this proteolytic system have acquired
other functions distinct from autophagy during eukaryote
evolution. as a first step to address this issue, we describe in
this work the generation and phenotype analysis of mutant
mice deficient in atg4c, a member of the atg4 family of
cysteine proteinases that exhibits a wide tissue distribution
and complements the deficiency of yeast atg4 in autophagic
processes. however, despite the wide expression pattern of
atg4c under normal conditions, targeted disruption of this
gene in mice does not cause any major abnormalities. thus,
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice develop normally, are fertile, and have long

mice to cancer development with
the finding that these mice show a
higher incidence of mca-induced
fibrosarcomas, which is consistent
with the proposed tumor suppres-
sor role for autophagy processes.
moreover, the fact that atg4c loss
leads to a reduced autophagic
response
in fibroblasts under
stressing conditions such as star-
vation could contribute to explain
the higher incidence of fibrosarco-
mas, which are fibroblast-derived
tumors, observed in atg4c mutant
mice.
in summary, in this work we show
that atg4c activity is not essential
for autophagy under normal condi-
tions in vivo. however, under
demanding conditions such as star-
vation atg4c disruption leads to a
tissue-specific decrease of autoph-
agy in diaphragm, a tissue that is
dependent on a continuous and
high rate of energy consumption,
and also to a reduced resistance to
prolonged fasting.
in addition,
atg4c⫺/⫺ mice also show a higher
incidence of mca-induced fibro-
sarcomas as compared with their
wild-type littermates, which could
be correlated to the decrease in
autophagy observed in atg4c-defi-
cient fibroblasts under nutritional
stressful conditions. further studies
involving mice deficient in other components of the atg4 pro-
teinase family will help to define the precise in vivo role of each
family member in both normal and pathological conditions
including cancer.

sented for atg4c⫹/⫹ (gray bars)- or atg4c⫺/⫺ (white bars)-derived cells. c, the contribution of autophagy to total
protein degradation in the presence of 3-methyladenine (3-methyladenine sensible degradation) under
serum, and amino acid deprivation was calculated as previously described (30). these results are taken from
four separate experiments with duplicate samples. four atg4c⫹/⫹ and five atg4c⫺/⫺ independent cell lines
were used. d, the contribution of autophagy to total protein degradation after transfection with
atg4c/pcdna3 or pcdna3 is presented for atg4c⫹/⫹- oratg4c ⫺/⫺-derived cells under serum and amino acid
deprivation.
starved atg4c⫺/⫺ mice will be very helpful to clarify this
question.
in addition to the relevance of autophagy as a physiologi-
cal response to starvation, this pathway has also been sug-
gested to play an important role in tumor development (52–
54). in this regard the activation of several tumor suppressor
genes as beclin-1, p53, pten , orp19arf are associated with
an up-regulation of autophagy, whereas their loss is often
accompanied by a loss of autophagic potential (44, 55–60).
on the other hand, several genes which act as oncogenes,
including akt, mtor , orras, are reported inhibitors of
autophagy, and their overexpression is associated with a
reduced ability of tumor cells to undergo autophagy (52,
61–63). furthermore, several recent studies have described
a protective role for autophagy as an alternative cell death
pathway that is activated in cancer cells that have lost their
potential to undergo apoptosis (64–66). all these findings
suggest that malignant transformation exposes cells to a
stressing situation in which all their autophagic potential
would be required. accordingly, a reduction in the ability of
inducing autophagy could eventually lead to a higher rate of
tumorigenesis under compromising conditions. to test this
hypothesis, we examined the susceptibility of atg4c⫺/⫺
