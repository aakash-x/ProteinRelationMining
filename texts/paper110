cancer develops when molecular pathways that control the ﬁne balance between proliferation, differentiation, autophagy and
cell death undergo genetic deregulation. the prospects for further substantial advances in the management of colorectal cancer
reside in a systematic genetic and functional dissection of these pathways in tumor cells. in an effort to evaluate the impact of
p38 signaling on colorectal cancer cell fate, we treated ht29, caco2, hct116, ls174t and sw480 cell lines with the inhibitor
sb202190 speciﬁc for p38a/b kinases. we report that p38a is required for colorectal cancer cell homeostasis as the inhibition of
its kinase function by pharmacological blockade or genetic inactivation causes cell cycle arrest, autophagy and cell death in a
cell type-speciﬁc manner. deﬁciency of p38a activity induces a tissue-restricted upregulation of the gabarap gene, an
essential component of autophagic vacuoles and autophagosomes, whereas simultaneous inhibition of autophagy signiﬁcantly
increases cell death by triggering apoptosis. these data identify p38a as a central mediator of colorectal cancer cell homeostasis
and establish a rationale for the evaluation of the pharmacological manipulation of the p38a pathway in the treatment of
colorectal cancer.

colorectal cancer is a major health concern, with more than
1 000 000 new cases and 500 000 deaths expected worldwide
per year.1 prognostic evaluation is currently based on
histological appearance, and there are no molecular markers
internationally recognized as standard predictor factors. the
conventional therapy involving surgery and adjuvant therapy
seems to give rise to improvements in progression-free
and overall survival. nevertheless about 50% of patients die
within 5 years owing to metastasis or recurrent disease.2 the
prospects for further substantial advances in the management
of colorectal cancer reside in a systematic genetic and
functional dissection of cell cycle and cell death regulatory
pathways in tumor cells in order to identify differential cellular
effects of agents that may have a direct impact on cancer
therapy.
during the last decade, a number of deacetylase inhibitors
(di) have been identiﬁed. these di induce tumor cells to
undergo growth arrest, differentiation, and/or apoptosis in
culture and in animal models, at doses that seem to be non-
toxic and appear to be selective. butyrate, a di that is naturally
formed in the human colon, is able to reduce the size and
the number of tumors in rat models of bowel cancer.3 in vitro,
sodium butyrate (nab) is a potent differentiating agent for
several colorectal cancer cell lines (crcs).4–6 nab-mediated
cell cycle withdrawal of crcs appears to be dependent on
acetylation of histones and consequent changes in transcrip-
tion, requiring continuous protein synthesis and the expres-
sion of p21.7 it has recently been shown that 1 mm nab is
the best working concentration to activate the differentiation
program in crcs without triggering apoptosis, whereas 5 mm
nab is sufﬁcient to induce a p53-independent apoptotic cell
death by activating a pathway involving p38, pparg and
caspases.6,8
several intracellular signaling cascades have been impli-
cated in the regulation of
the proliferation-differentiation
balance in enterocytes by the coordinated expression of the
genome in response to environmental cues. during enter-
ocyte differentiation of crcs the erk pathway is switched off,
whereas pi3k class i and p38 activities are increased and
essential for full differentiation.5,9 it has been suggested that
p38a could activate the intestinal-speciﬁc homeobox tran-
scription factor cdx2 probably by phosphorylation.10 this
mechanism resembles that described for p38a/b in muscle
cells, where they phosphorylate the transcription factor mef2
and the swi/snf subunit baf60 to remodel chromatin and
activate tissue-speciﬁc transcription.11,12 interestingly, chro-
matin remodeling complex dysfunction has been described in
human colorectal cancer cells.13
the p38 pathway is often activated by stressful stimuli and
cytokines leading to diverse cell type-speciﬁc responses, such

as cell survival or apoptosis. in non-transformed cells, p38a
is required for inhibition of proliferation induced by cell-to-cell
contact, as happens in primary cultures of human ﬁbro-
blasts.14 in cancer cells, p38a/b are required for breast and
colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis formation in
mice.15,16 however, over-activation of p38 by a constitutively
active form of its upstream kinase (mkk6ee) eliminates the
tumor-prone phenotype of mice obtained by intercrossing
transgenic mice with breast-restricted expression of wip1, the
p53-induced phosphatase targeting p38 and the oncogene
erbb2.17 moreover, p38a/b contribute to tgfb-dependent
tumor progression by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal
transdifferentiation and cell migration,18 and to rat chondro-
sarcoma cell proliferation.19
in an effort to elucidate the impact of p38 in the molecular
mechanisms regulating crc fate, we analyzed gene expres-
sion proﬁle of ht29 cells growing logarithmically, conﬂuent
in culture and induced to differentiate. five genes were
considered, three of them were cell cycle-related genes:
cyclin e is expressed during the late g1 phase of the cell cycle
until the end of the s-phase, cyclin a starts to accumulate
during s phase and is abruptly destroyed before metaphase,
and, ﬁnally, p21 is involved in the control of g1/s and g2/m
transitions. the other two genes codify for tissue-speciﬁc
proteins: sucrose isomaltase (si) is an intestinal disaccha-
ridase expressed in the brush border of mature enterocytes;
villin is a cytoskeletal protein speciﬁc for microvilli.
at the onset of differentiation, the pharmacological block-
ade of the p38 cascade inhibits the expression of p21, si and
villin conﬁrming the role of this pathway in the differentiation
program of distinct cell types.9–12 surprisingly, we discovered
that p38a is required for crc proliferation and survival as
pharmacological blockade or genetic depletion of its kinase
activity induced growth arrest, autophagy and cell death in a
cell type-speciﬁc manner. interestingly, the inhibition of the
autophagic activity of these cells induces a dramatic increase
in cell death by triggering apoptosis.

speciﬁc compound sb202190 (sb) was evaluated by
analyzing the expression of cyclin e, cyclin a, p21, si and
villin transcripts in ht29 cells growing logarithmically,
conﬂuent

1 mm for 96 h (figure 1a). sb addition to logarithmically
growing cultures caused a signiﬁcant reduction of cyclin e
expression already within the ﬁrst 24 h, whereas it
downregulated cyclin a transcription only after 72 h of
treatment
(figure 1b). moreover, despite the signiﬁcant
reduction in the proliferation rate, the levels of p21 were
consistently lower than those of untreated cells (figure 1b).
conversely, in conﬂuent cultures, sb only slightly affected
p21 expression induced by cell-to-cell contact (figure 1b). in
cell death and differentiation
differentiating ht29 cells, p38 blockade counteracted the
effect of nab on the silencing of cyclins, induction of p21
and expression of enterocyte-speciﬁc markers (figure 1b).
collectively these data suggested that the p38 pathway is
involved in the transcription control of both cell cycle and
tissue-speciﬁc genes.

(figure 2a). the percentage of cells
presenting vacuoles was time dependent as well. at 24 h
more than 90% of cells presented at least one vacuole ﬁlling
up most of the cytoplasmic compartment (figures 2 and 4a).
the observation that sb treatment caused growth inhibition
and the formation of intracellular vacuoles, prompted us to
investigate their nature. to this end we employed different
cytological methods such as periodic-acid schiff (pas),
papanicolaou, sudan black b and oil red o. among them
only pas demonstrated a dot-like staining within vacuoles
suggesting the presence of glycoproteins (figure 2b). elec-
tron microscopy showed that sb-treated cells were roundly
shaped and displayed a dark cytoplasm containing a
heterochromatic nucleus. numerous large vacuoles ﬁlled
up with dense material, autophagic vacuoles containing cell
organelle debris and double-membrane autophagosomes
were recognized (figure 3).
in untreated ht29 cells no
molecular features of autophagy were detected (data not
shown). quite different was the morphology of fully differ-
entiated ht29 cells, which appeared elongated, and dis-
played euchromatic nuclei and electron clear cytoplasms
with numerous mitochondria and a few small empty vacuoles.
moreover, circular structures coated with regular microvilli,
often located at
the apical cellular surface (intracellular
lumens, il) or between the cells (intercellular cysts, ic), were
observed (figure 3). in ht29 cells either untreated or treated
with sb no il or ic were detected (figure 3 and data not
shown).
the detection of these ultrastructural ﬁndings, deﬁned as
the ‘golden standard’ for assessing autophagic activity,20
clearly indicated that pharmacological blockade of p38
induced an autophagic response in ht29 cells. further
evidence was provided by the pretreatment with 3-methyl-
adenine (3ma) or with the inhibitor of translation puromycin,
two well-known inhibitors of the autophagic process, that
severely impaired sb-dependent induction of autophagy in
ht29 cells (figure 4a). to better characterize this process,
we evaluated the expression of the gabarap gene, one
of the human homologs of the yeast atg8 gene. atg8 is a
member of a novel ubiquitin-like protein family and an
essential component of the autophagic machinery. in yeast,
it is upregulated by rapamycin-dependent tor inhibition and
nitrogen starvation.21 in ht29 cells, gabarap expression
levels were signiﬁcantly augmented by p38 blockade and
correlated with autophagic vacuoles and autophagosome

induce both autophagy and gabarap upregulation in these
cells (data not shown). interestingly, 3ma failed to impair the
sb-mediated induction of gabarap expression (figure 4b).
this is noteworthy as 3ma prevents autophagy at an early
stage by inhibiting pi3k class iii, which interacts with atg6/
beclin-1 to promote the nucleation of autophagic vesicles.22,23

the p38 control of gabarap

sb-dependent induction of autophagy relies only upon
p38a blockade. as sb speciﬁcally inhibits p38 a and b gene
products, we investigated whether both isoforms were
synthesized in ht29 cells. it was previously reported that
caco2 cells exhibit distinct proﬁles of p38 isoform expression
depending on the differentiation status. undifferentiated
cells produce p38a, b and g, whereas differentiated cells
synthesize p38a, g and d.25 conversely,
the expression
proﬁle of p38 isoforms in ht29 cells remained unchanged
regardless of
the cells
expressed p38a, g and d despite nab treatment (figure 5a
and b). the absence of p38b transcripts suggested that
sb-mediated autophagic response relies only upon p38a
blockade. to test
this hypothesis, we used sirna gene
silencing targeting p38 a and b gene in ht29 cells
(figure 5e). the sirna against p38a reduced the target
mrna and protein levels by 70–80%, whereas the sirna
against the b isoform did not affect nor p38a mrna neither
total p38 protein expression in accordance with the absence
of p38b in these cells (figure 5c). evaluation of
the
autophagic activity and gabarap expression in sirna-
transfected cells clearly indicated that
transient genetic
ablation of p38a was able to induce autophagy in ht29
colorectal cancer cells (figure 5d).
in fact,
colorectal cancer-speciﬁc induction of autophagic cell
death by p38a inhibition. to get further insight into the
involvement of p38a in the autophagic response, we extended
our investigation to caco2, sw480, ls174t and hct116
crcs (tables 1 and 2). cytological and morphological
evaluation conﬁrmed the sb-mediated induction of growth
arrest and autophagic cell death in all crc lines (figures 6a–
c). consistently, sb-mediated upregulation of gabarap was
detected in all cell lines tested (figure 6e). pharmacological
blockade of autophagy drastically increased cell death by
promoting a switch from autophagic death to apoptosis
(figure 6c, and data not shown).
to investigate whether p38a inhibition induced type ii cell
death in a cell type-speciﬁc manner, hep3b liver carcinoma
cells, hela cervical carcinoma cells, hek293 embryonic
kidney cells, and human fetal skin ﬁbroblasts (hfsf) were
exposed to sb for 24 h (figure 6d and table 2). pharmaco-
logical
inhibition of p38 failed to induce cell cycle arrest,
autophagy and cell death, and it did not promote gabarap
upregulation in any of the cell lines tested (figure 6d and e,
and data not shown).
the analysis of the relative abundance of p38 a and b
transcripts in all cell lines studied, suggested that the cell type-
speciﬁc effect caused by sb is independent of the expression
of p38b and relies only upon the presence of p38a in crcs
(figure 6f).
moreover, sb treatment failed to cause autophagic cell
death in c3h10t1/2 and nih3t3 mouse ﬁbroblasts, c2c12
mouse myoblasts and human rd rhabdomyosarcoma cells
(table 2). all together, these data suggest that p38a blockade
induces growth inhibition, autophagy and cell death in crcs
in a cell type-speciﬁc manner.

discussion
we demonstrated that p38a is one of the essential kinases for
colorectal cancer cells fate and provided evidences indicating
that p38a blockade causes growth arrest and autophagic
cell death. in crcs, p38a is required for both cell cycle
progression and nab-dependent induction of cell differentia-
that p38a is
tion. furthermore, our experiments reveal
required for survival of crcs growing logarithmically,
conﬂuent in culture or induced to differentiate. in fact, p38a
blockade induces an autophagic response in these cells
associated to growth suppression and cell death in a p53- and
p21-independent manner.
the involvement of p38 activity
in the negative
control of autophagy has been evoked in human liver
response to cellular hydration state, but not
in mouse
myotube response to amino-acid starvation.26 in yeasts,
hog1, the homolog of p38, plays a role in the stabilization
machinery of nitrogen deprivation-induced autophagy
during ambient osmolarity changes.27 in logarithmically
growing crcs, p38a inhibition induces a cell
type-
speciﬁc upregulation of
the human homolog of atg8
(gabarap), suggesting that p38a is required to exert a
negative control on the expression of this gene. in yeasts,
the atg8 gene is upregulated by rapamycin-dependent tor
inhibition, and its protein product is an essential component of
the
expansion
machinery.21 in crcs,
rapamycin failed to cause both
autophagy and upregulation of gabarap expression. to
date, three atg8 homologs have been identiﬁed in mammalian
cells: gate-16, gabarap and map1lc3. all three proteins
appear to be modiﬁed with lipids in the same manner
described in yeasts, and have been shown to localize to the
autophagosome.28

figure 6 sb202190 induces autophagic cell death in colorectal cancer cells in a cell type-speciﬁc manner. (a–c) sw480, caco2 and hct116 cells were cultured in the
absence or presence of sb202190 (sb) or a combination of sb202190 and 3-methyiladenine (3ma) for the indicated period of time. cells were suspended in a trypan blue
solution or in a dye mix containing dapi and ethidium bromide. (a) relative viability (%) was estimated by calculating the ratio between viable cells in treated (sb, sbþ 3ma)
versus untreated ( ) ht29. (b) the percentage of autophagic cells was estimated by phase-contrast microscopy and then veriﬁed by electron microscope evaluation. (c)
relative cell death (%) represents the ratio between dead cells in treated versus untreated ht29. (d) equal number of hela, hfsf, hep3b and hek293 cells were seeded and
cultured in the absence or presence of sb202190 for 24 h. cells were scored for autophagic activity (data not shown), and viability by trypan blue staining (viable cells/total
number of cells). (e, f) sw480, caco2, hct116, hela, hfsf, hep3b and hek293 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of sb202190 for 24 h. relative abundance of
gabarap (e) or p38 a and b (f) transcripts in the indicated cell lines were evaluated by genescan estimation of ﬂuorescent rt-pcr products and normalization on gapdh
very interestingly, pretreatment with 3ma or puromycin
reduces the number and size of vacuoles together with the
percentage of autophagic cells in sb-treated crcs, whereas
the induction of gabarap expression remains unaffected.
3ma controls the activity of the pi3k class iii enzyme which is
important in the early stages of autophagic vescicle formation
by inducing the assembly of autophagosome precursors.22,23
in yeast, pi3k/vps34 forms a multiprotein complex including
also atg6 and atg14. in humans, the mammalian homolog
of atg6, named beclin-1, has been found mutated in cancer
cells revealing its causative role for autophagy deﬁciency in
cancerogenesis.20
autophagy is a cellular process that can ﬁnally consent cell
survival
in stress conditions or trigger type ii cell death
depending on the cell type and speciﬁc stimuli.24,28 recent
work indicates that several
intracellular mediators of auto-
phagy are deregulated during malignant transformation, with
the autophagic activity.20,24,29
a consequent reduction of
cancer cell lines often have lower autophagic capacity than
their normal counterparts and fail to respond to serum/amino-
acid deprivation or high cell density. a decrease in autophagic
capacity has been also observed during animal experimental
carcinogenesis.20 another point underscoring the relevance
of autophagy in cancer cells derives from the observation
that some malignant cell types respond to chemotherapy or
radiation by triggering autophagy,
indicating the potential
utility of autophagic cell death induction in cancer therapy.30
treatment with rapamycin, temozolomide or arsenic trioxide
of malignant glioma cells induces an autophagic cell death
response.31–33 however that’s not always the case. in fact,
characterization of the effects of two dna-damaging agents,
such as temozolide and etoposide, suggests that
these
chemotherapy compounds induce an autophagy-associated
atp surge that protects cells contributing to drug resistance of
malignant glioma.34 moreover, autophagy could represent a
defense mechanism against sulforaphane-induced apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells and against dna-damaging agents in
breast cancer.35,36 it has been recently shown that when cells
with defects in apoptosis are subjected to metabolic stress,
they activate autophagy to survive. inhibition of autophagy

triggers a necrotic pathway leading to cell death. in solid
tumors, this necrosis is associated with inﬂammation, which
creates a microenvironment favoring survival and increased
proliferation of a small population of damaged cells. the ﬁnal
effect of this process is the enhancement of tumor growth.37
thus, it seems that the role of autophagy in triggering survival
or death in response to cancer therapies may vary depending
on different cell types and treatments.
according with our results, it seems that p38a blockade in
crcs inhibits a survival pathway leading to autophagy, which
probably initially represents a defense mechanism to survive.
along the treatment, these autophagic cells die with features
of non-apoptotic death indicating the occurrence of auto-
phagic cell death or type ii programmed cell death. although the
increased percentage of dead cells caused by 3ma-depen-
dent inhibition of autophagy could appear in conﬂict with
this hypothesis, but these cells actually showed distinctive
traits of apoptosis. to explain these data we propose a model
suggesting that autophagy represents a survival response
to p38a blockade, but prolonged inactivation of the kinase
leads to cell death. inhibition of autophagy breaks this process
and triggers an apoptotic response. the effect of sb
treatment in crcs recalls that of arsenic trioxide in glioma
cells. in fact, the addition of an autophagy inhibitor enhances
the antitumor effect through the switch between autophagic to
apoptotic cell death.33 in accordance with this hypothesis,
removal of sb within the ﬁrst 48 h of treatment induces a
signiﬁcant time-dependent reduction in vacuole number and
size together with a slow re-entry in the cell cycle with a
dubling time of about 80 h (comes and simone, unpublished
results).
our experiments reveal that sb induces autophagic cell
death in a cell type-speciﬁc manner as normal cells and
cancer cells of different origin fail to respond to p38a blockade.
therefore, our ﬁndings establish a rationale for the evaluation
of p38a-speciﬁc inhibition as potential therapeutic tool, alone
or in combination with other compounds, in the treatment
of colorectal cancer. in fact, as reported in table 1, the
crc lines used in these study display signiﬁcant differences
both in genotype and phenotype. none of the molecular
characteristics of these cells seem to be correlated with
the common autophagic cell death response to sb.
moreover, balb/c mice treated daily by intraperitoneal
injection of sb for nine days survived without body and colon
weight changes. it is noteworthy that the colon of these mice
showed normal architecture at the histological analysis.38
furthermore, a novel strategy for local delivery of sb has
renal ﬁbrosis,39 indicating that
been developed to treat
pharmacological manipulation of p38 is emerging as a
potential therapeutic tool for a number of human diseases.
in this sense, our study might have an even broader interest.
in conclusion, the experimental model we have described
can represent a useful system to study human autophagy
in vitro.
materials and methods
reagents. sb202190 (10 mm), pd98059 (20 mm), ly294002 (25 mm),
rapamycin (100 nm) and nab (1–5 mm) were purchased from calbiochem;
puromycin (10 mm), 3-methyladenine (10 mm), sudan black b, oil red o, trypan
blue, dapi and ethidium bromide were purchased from sigma.
cell culture and microscopic quantitation of proliferation,
viability and cell death. ht29, sw480, hct116 and caco2 cells were
cultured as described.40 ls174t, hep3b, hela, hek293, c2c12, ch310t1/2,
nih3t3 and rd cells were maintained in dmem with 10% fbs. hfsf were isolated
and cultured as described.40 the proliferation, viability and cell death of the reported
cell
lines were scored by cell counting. brieﬂy, at the indicated time points the
supernatants (containing dead/ﬂoating cells) were collected, and the remaining
adherent cells were detached with trypsin/edta. after that, both cell suspensions
were mixed and cell pellets were obtained. cell pellets were suspended in pbs 1
and then 10 ml were mixed with equal volume of 0.01% trypan blue solution. the
mixture was then transferred to the hemacytometer. viable cells (unstained cells)
and dead cells (stained cells) were counted with a phase-contrast microscope
( 40). to score the proliferation rate the entire counting grid was analyzed,
whereas to evaluate viability 200 cells were counted. to determine the percentage
of cells dying for apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death, 25 ml of cell suspensions
were mixed with 1 ml of dye mix containing dapi (1 mg/ml) and ethidium bromide
(100 mg/m). the mixture was placed on a microscope slide and covered with a
22 mm2 coverslip. the slides were examined with the ‘zeiss axioskop 2 plus’
ﬂuorescent microscope ( 400). for each sample 200 cells were counted and
recorded as v (viable cells), nvn (non-viable cells with normal nuclei) and nva
(non-viable cells with apoptotic nuclei). the % of apoptotic versus non-apoptotic
dead cells was calculated (% apoptotic cells¼ 100 nva/(vaþ nvnþ nva); %
non-apoptotic cells¼ 100 nvn/(vaþ nvnþ nva)).
to avoid possible inﬂuence of cell density on cell growth and survival, every set
of experiments (at least three replicates) was performed by seeding cells at different
densities: from 50 103 to 500 103 cells in six-well dishes and from 500 103 to
1000 103 in 60-mm-diameter dishes. the data shown in the ‘results’ section are
representative of three or more independent sets of experiments.
dna fragmentation assay. the supernatants were mixed with the
remaining adherent cells detached with trypsin/edta, and cell pellets were
suspended in hypotonic lysis buffer. after centrifugation at 14 000 r.p.m. for 20 min,
proteinase k and then rnasi a, was added. samples were subjected to double
phenol/chloroform extraction, dna precipitation, suspension in te and loaded into
1% agarose gel.
rna interference. ht29 cells were seeded at 1500 103 cells/well in six-well
dishes. twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transfected with 200 pmol of
sigenome smartpool
from dharmacon (m-003512-05-0005)
containing four sirna duplexes direct against p38a or p38b open-reading frame
using 10 ml of lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa).
reagent
rna extraction and cdna synthesis. total rna was extracted with
trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) following the manufacturer’s
instruction. to avoid possible dna contaminations, rna was treated with dnaase-
1 (ambion, austin, tx, usa). rna purity was also checked by spectrophotometer
and rna integrity by examination on agarose gel electrophoresis.
in every
experiment, one to four micrograms of total rna were retro-transcribed using high
capacity dna archive kit (applied biosystem, foster city, ca, usa) and following
the manufacturer’s instruction.
semiquantitative rt-pcr. rt-pcr was performed using speciﬁc primers
whose sequence is available on request. standard curves were performed using
serial dilutions of cdna to deﬁne the dynamic range and calculate the ampliﬁcation
efﬁciency (see figure 1). the pcr conditions were the following: 5 min at 941c for
one cycle; 30 s at 941c, 30 s at 59–621c and 1 min at 681c for 22–28 cycles. to
quantify the relative abundance of gene-speciﬁc transcripts, ﬂuorescent-labelled
pcr products were analyzed on an abi310 sequencer (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca, usa) with genescan software following the manufacturer’s instruction,
and normalized to gapdh transcripts (see supplementary figure 1). multiplex rt-
pcr was performed with quiagen multiplex pcr master mix using speciﬁc primers
described previously.25
quantitative real-time pcr. to detect mrna expression levels for the p38
a and b genes, primers were designed using primer express software spanning
intron/exon boundaries whenever possible. pcr assays were performed in 96-well
optical reaction plates using the abi 7500ht machine (applied biosystem, foster
city, ca, usa). pcr assays were conducted in triplicate wells for each sample. the
following reaction mixture per well was used: 10 ml power syber green (applied

biosystem, foster city, ca, usa), 2.4 ml of primers at the ﬁnal concentration of
150 nm, 4.6 ml rnaase free water, 3 ml cdna. for all experiments the following
pcr conditions were used: 951c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 951c for 15 s
then at 601c for 60 s. quantitative normalization of cdna in each sample were
performed using cyclophillin mrna as internal control. relative quantiﬁcation was
carried out using the ddct method. mock-transfected cells were used as calibrator
to determine relative expression level.
immunoblot assay. immunoblots were performed according to the cell
signaling instructions. brieﬂy, cells were homogenized by sonication in 1 sds
sample buffer (62.5 mm tris-hcl ph 6.8, 2% w/v sds, 10% glycerol and 50 mm
dtt). 50 mg of protein extract from each sample were electrophoresed in a 10%
sds-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to hybond-p pvdf membrane (amersham
biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa). the blots were blocked 1 h at rt in blocking
buffer (1 tbs, 0.1% tween-20 with 5% w/v non-fat dry milk) and washed with
tbs/t. the membranes were incubated with anti-p38 antibody (cell signaling;
1 : 1000) in 10 ml primary antibody dilution buffer (1 tbs, 0.1% tween-20 with 5%
bsa) overnight at 41c. after that, the blots were extensively washed and incubated
with the anti-rabbit secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (1:20 000;
amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa) in blocking buffer for 45 min, then
washed and developed with the ecl chemiluminescence reagent (amersham
biosciences, piscataway, nj, usa) as directed by the manufacturer.
morphological evaluation. numerous slides with a monolayer cells were
either rapidly ﬁxed in 95% ethyl alcohol for a minimum of 15 min (before staining with
papanicolaou and pas) or unﬁxed (before staining for lipids with sudan black b, oil
red o). slides were examined by optic microscopy (nikon eclipse 80i).
measurement of vacuole size. digital
images of living vacuolated cells
were imported on adobe photoshop software, version 7.0. the diameter of each
vacuole in 50 randomly selected cells was measured and expressed in a pixel scale.
the length of one grid in a micro-grid slide was also measured in a pixel scale. the
diameter of each vacuole on a pixel scale was converted into micrometers based on
the pixels of the standard grid length. the resolution of all the images was kept
constant during the whole procedure.
electron microscopy. cells were ﬁxed in 3% gta in phosphate buffer 0.1 m
for 2 h, washed in the same buffer and then post-ﬁxed in 1% oso4 at 41c.
afterwards, cells were scraped with a rubber bar, dehydrated in graded ethanols,
and embedded in epon 812. ultrathin sections (60 nm) were cut with a diamond
knife on a lkb-v ultratome, stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead cytrate and
examined under a ‘zeiss 9a’ electron microscope. to score autophagy 100 cells for
each sample were counted.
