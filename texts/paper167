dysferlin is a type-ii transmembrane protein and the causative gene of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type
2b and miyoshi myopathy (lgmd2b/mm), in which speciﬁc loss of dysferlin labeling has been frequently
observed. recently, a novel mutant (l1341p) dysferlin has been shown to aggregate in the muscle of the
patient. little is known about the relationship between degradation of dysferlin and pathogenesis of
lgmd2b/mm. here, we examined the degradation of normal and mutant (l1341p) dysferlin. wild-type (wt)
dysferlin mainly localized to the er/golgi, associated with retrotranslocon, sec61a, and vcp(p97), and
was degraded by endoplasmic reticulum (er)-associated degradation system (erad) composed of ubiqui-
tin/proteasome. in contrast, mutant dysferlin spontaneously aggregated in the er and induced eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2a (eif2a) phosphorylation and lc3 conversion, a key step for autophagosome
formation, and ﬁnally, er stress cell death. unlike proteasome inhibitor, e64d/pepstatin a, inhibitors of lyso-
somal proteases did not stimulate the accumulation of the wt-dysferlin, but stimulated aggregation of mutant
dysferlin in the er. furthermore, deﬁciency of atg5 and dephosphorylation of eif2a, key molecules for lc3
conversion, also stimulated the mutant dysferlin aggregation in the er. rapamycin, which induces eif2a
phosphorylation-mediated lc3 conversion, inhibited mutant dysferlin aggregation in the er. thus, mutant
dysferlin aggregates in the er-stimulated autophagosome formation to engulf them via activation of er
stress-eif2a phosphorylation pathway. we propose two erad models for dysferlin degradation, ubiquitin/
proteasome erad(i) and autophagy/lysosome erad(ii). mutant dysferlin aggregates on the er are degraded
by the autophagy/lysosome erad(ii), as an alternative to erad(i), when retrotranslocon/erad(i) system is
impaired by these mutant aggregates.

dysferlin labeling has been frequently observed in the muscle
tissues of lgmd2b/mm patients (1,2). little is known about
the degradation of wild-type (wt) and mutant dysferlin.
endoplasmic reticulum (er) quality-control system recog-
nizes and removes nascent proteins that fail to fold or assem-
ble properly. the aberrant proteins such as misfolded and
malfolded proteins activate stress-signaling pathways
to
rescue the cells via er stress-sensor proteins such as perk
[protein kinase regulated by rna (pkr)-like er kinase]
(8,9). the aberrant proteins are extracted and retrotranslocated
to the cytoplasm where they are degraded by the er-
associated egradation (erad) system composed of ubiqui-
tin/proteasome (10 – 12). valosin-containing protein p97
[vcp(p97)] and sec61 are involved in the retrotranslocation
for the extraction of aberrant luminal and membrane proteins
from the er (13). if insufﬁciently degraded, the accumulated
aberrant proteins in the er are assumed to activate the er
stress-mediated cell death pathway via activation of the
c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) and/or caspase-12 located at
the outer layer of the er (14,15). er stress is closely
related with the pathogenesis of conformation diseases such
as parkinson’s disease and polyglutamine (polyq) disease
(15,16). recently, some novel variants of lgmd2b/mm
have shown patchy sarcolemmal immunostaining or intra-
cellular aggregates of dysferlin in the muscle ﬁbers of patients
(17,18). a relationship between er stress and mutant
(l1341p)-dysferlin aggregates has also been suggested.
macroautophagy (hereafter
referred to as autophagy)
engulfs bulk cytosolic material and organelles within double-
membrane vesicles, known as autophagosomes, and then
degrades them to liberate nutrients via fusion with the lyso-
some (this pathway is hereafter referred to as autophagy/lyso-
some). the molecular mechanism of autophagy formation has
been intensely studied in yeast and mammalian cells (19,20);
many autophagy-related genes (atgs) are involved in the
autophagy formation. in addition to ubiquitin/proteasome,
constitutive autophagy has an important role in protein-quality
control; atg7- and/or atg5-deﬁcient mice show the accumu-
lation of ubiquitinated proteins in the liver and brain (21 – 23).
very recently, we have shown that cytoplasmic polyq-induced
autophagy formation is linked to er stress-mediated perk/
eif2a (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a) phosphoryl-
ation and that cytoplasmic polyq aggregates, which are not sufﬁ-
ciently degraded by ubiquitin/proteasome system, are degraded
by autophagy/lysosome (15,24). thus, constitutive autophagy
is stimulated to degrade the cytoplasmic mutant protein aggre-
gates by their aggregate-mediated stress-induced eif2a phos-
phorylation. however, it is not clear how aberrant membrane
protein aggregates located in the er are degraded when retrotran-
slocation or ubiquitin/proteasome erad is impaired.
however, since it is technically difﬁcult to distinguish nor-
mally folded and misfolded state in the wt-dysferlin, we exam-
ined the difference between the effects of wt-dysferlin and
mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin with malfolded states on their
possible degradation systems, ubiquitin/proteasome and autop-
hagy/lysosome. we demonstrate that wt-dysferlin is localized
to the er and is a substrate for ubiquitin/proteasome
erad(i), while mutant dysferlin aggregates are additionally
degraded by the autophagy/lysosome erad(ii).

subcellular localization of dysferlin
we examined the subcellular distribution of dysferlin in c2c5
cells by immunostaining with several subcellular markers
(fig. 1). although dysferlin is expressed ubiquitously in
various cells, its levels are undetectable by immunostaining

myc-his-wt-dysferlin (tet-wt-dysferlin c2c5 cells) were incubated in medium containing tetracycline (tet). dysferlin localization was examined by immuno-

localization after
except in muscle tissues. therefore, we prepared c2c5 cells
expressing tetracycline (tet)-inducible wt-dysferlin gene
(tet-wt-dysferlin c2c5 cells), controlled the expression of
wt-dysferlin using this tet-on/off system, and examined its
subcellular
induction. tet-wt-dysferlin
partially localized to the er (anti-kdel reactivity) and to
the golgi (anti-gm130 reactivity), but not to the lysosome
(anti-cathepsin d reactivity) or mitochondria (anti-f0atpase
reactivity) (fig. 1a). approximately, 4% of the cells showed
tet-wt-dysferlin accumulation in the er/golgi. the accumu-
lated tet-wt-dysferlin colocalized with sec61a and partly
colocalized with vcp(p97), components of retrotranslocon
on the er (fig. 1b and c). furthermore, wt-dysferlin was
associated with sec61a and vcp(p97) in cos cells (fig. 1d).
relationship between dysferlin accumulation in the er
and impaired erad
we examined the two possible degradation systems for
wt-dysferlin; ubiquitin/proteasome erad and the lysosome.
recently, we showed that cytoplasmic polyq aggregates,
which inhibit the function of the erad and retrotranslocon,
stimulate perk/eif2a phosphorylation, thereby activating the
autophagic pathway as well as the apoptotic pathway (24,25).
cytoplasmic polyq aggregates stimulated tet-wt-dysferlin
accumulation in the er (fig. 2a); the population of cells
showing this accumulation was increased by about 5-fold
with the presence of the cytoplasmic polyq aggregates. the
proteasome inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-l- leucyl-l-leucyl-
leucinal
[z-lll-cho (mg132); lll], also induced the
accumulation of tet-wt-dysferlin in the er. lll (5 mm) treat-
ment
induced dysferlin accumulation in a triton-insoluble
fraction within 12 – 24 h (fig. 2b). lll (5 mm) as well as
polyq aggregates stimulated tet-wt-dysferlin accumulation
in the er (fig. 2c). the accumulated tet-wt-dysferlin
co-aggregated with anti-polyubiquitin reactivity (fig. 2d).
in contrast, lysosomal protease inhibitors, e64d (10 mg/ml),
membrane permeable inhibitor of cathepsin a, h and l,
and pepstatin a (10 mg/ml), an inhibitor of cathepsin d and e,
did not stimulate the tet-wt-dysferlin accumulation in the
human molecular genetics, 2007, vol. 16, no. 6
621
er (fig. 2b and c). thus, wt-dysferlin seems to be mainly
degraded in the ubiquitin/proteasome erad but not in the
lysosome.
brefeldin, an inhibitor for trans-golgi network, as well as
other er stress stimuli such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin
slightly stimulated the accumulation of tet-wt-dysferlin in
the er (fig. 2e), suggesting that only a small population of
tet-wt-dysferlin as well as endogenous dysferlin is transported
to the cell surface but a large population of tet-wt-dysferlin
remains in the er/golgi. thus, wt-dysferlin is preferentially
recognized by the retrotranslocon and more easily degraded
by ubiquitin/proteasome erad when compared with other
er proteins.
dysferlin aggregation in the er and er stress cell death
in contrast with wt-dysferlin, overexpressed mutant dysferlins
(l1341p and w999c) (18,26) spontaneously formed patchy
aggregations in the er (fig. 3a and supplementary material,
fig. s1); mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin had patchy aggregation in
28 h, and formed large aggregates, which led to apoptotic fea-
tures in 32 h, while wt-dysferlin did not show the spontaneous
aggregates and apoptotic feature at 32 h after transfection
(fig. 3b).
defects in erad, inhibition of proteasome activity and
impaired retrotranslocation causes the accumulation of er
proteins, which subsequently induces er stress-induced cell
death. like lll treatment, the overexpression of the mutant
(l1341p)-dysferlin induced c/ebp homologous protein
(chop) up-regulation and c-jun phosphorylation (anti-jun-p
positive)
in 28 h and caspase-12 activation (anti-active
caspase-12-positive) in 32 h (fig. 3c and supplementary
material, fig. s2). the patchy aggregates colocalized with
ubiquitin immunoreactivity (fig. 3c and supplementary
material, fig. s3). thus, the mutant dysferlin accumulates
and spontaneously aggregates in the er and has a potential
ability to induce the er stress cell death.
degradation of mutant dysferlin aggregates in lysosome
we compared the degradation of tet-wt and -mutant (l1341p)
dysferlin. lll stimulated both tet-wt and -mutant dysferlin
accumulation and aggregation in the er (fig. 4a upper and
lower), and increased the number of cells expressing dysferlin
aggregates (fig. 4a upper and middle); the population of cells
showing wt- and mutant-dysferlin aggregates were increased
from 2 – 3% to 67% and 39 – 91% by lll treatment, respect-
ively. e64d/pepstatin a also stimulated the accumulation
and aggregation of tet-mutant dysferlin in the er but did
not tet-wt-dysferlin (fig. 4b upper and lower). the popu-
lation of cells showing the mutant dysferlin aggregates was
increased from 33 to 68% by e64d/pepstatin a treatment,
but the population of cells showing wt-dysferlin aggregates
was not (fig. 4b upper and middle). thus, in contrast with
tet-wt-dysferlin data, tet-mutant dysferlin seems to be
degraded not only by the ubiquitin/proteasome but also by
the lysosome.

golgi-endosome pathway (27) and autophagy pathway (20).
brefeldin a (10 mm) did not signiﬁcantly stimulate mutant
dysferlin aggregation in the er (supplementary material,
fig. s4), suggesting that mutant dysferlin preferentially localizes
to the er/golgi. therefore, the golgi-endosome pathway cannot
be the major pathway by which mutant dysferlin undergoes lyso-
somal degradation. we next examined the possible involvement
of the autophagy pathway in the lysosomal degradation of
mutant dysferlin.
eif2a phosphorylation stimulates autophagosome for-
mation (28) and the atg5 – atg12 complex-dependent conver-
sion of lc3 [atg8; microtubule-associated protein 1 (map1)
light chain 3] (24), lc3-i (18 kda; free form) and lc3-ii
(16 kda; membrane-bound form), are involved in key steps
of autophagosome formation (19,20). we previously demon-
strated that er stress stimuli such as tunicamycin and thapsi-
gargin, which stimulate eif2a phosphorylation, induce the
expression of atg12 gene and lc3 conversion (24). dominant
negative (dn) perk (29) and dephosphorylation of eif2a
(30)
inhibited the thapsigargin-induced lc3 conversion
(fig. 5a and b). thus, er stress stimulated the autophago-
some formation by activating the perk – eif2a phosphoryl-
ation pathway.
we examined the involvement of the autophagy/lysosome
pathway in the degradation of the mutant dysferlin aggregates
in the er. in contrast with wt-dysferlin, overexpression of

with no stress, while lc3-ii, which is tightly associated with
the autophagosomal membrane, shows intense vesicular and
granular anti-lc3 immunostaining (31,32). immunostaining
analysis showed that most cells expressing mutant dysferlin
aggregates were eif2a phosphorylation-positive and vesicular
anti-lc3-positive, while cells expressing wt-dysferlin were
negative (fig. 5e). most of the patchy aggregates of mutant
dysferlin colocalized with vesicular anti-lc3 reactivity.
þ/þ
the deﬁciency of atg5 stimulated the accumulation of
triton-insoluble mutant (l1341p) dysferlin and increased
the population of cells containing aggregated mutant dysferlin
(fig. 6a); the population of cells displaying wt- and mutant
) mouse
dysferlin was 13 and 24% in wild-type (atg5
embryonic ﬁbroblast (mef) cells, respectively, and 20 and
53% in atg52/2 mef cells (33), respectively. thus, autop-
hagy mediates the transfer of mutant dysferlin rather than
wt-dysferlin from the er to the lysosome. eif2adephosphory-
lation, which inhibits autophagosome formation (24,28),
also stimulated the accumulation of triton-insoluble mutant
(l1341p)-dysferlin and its aggregation, and increased the
population of cells expressing mutant dysferlin aggregates
(fig. 6b); the population of cells displaying wt- and mutant
dysferlin were 10 and 17% in wild-type (eif2a s/s) mef
cells, respectively, and 22 and 46% in eif2a a/a mef
cells (30), respectively. these results suggest
that mutant
dysferlin aggregation in the er stimulates autophagosome for-
mation by activation of er stress-eif2a phosphorylation
pathway.
stimulation of the degradation of mutant
dysferlin by rapamycin
rapamycin stimulates autophagy formation via mammalian
target of rapamycin (34). it has also been shown to promote
the degradation of polyq aggregates thereby inhibiting cell
death (24,35,36). rapamycin also stimulates gcn2-mediated
eif2a phosphorylation in yeast (37) and lc3 conversion via
perk-independent eif2a phosphorylation (24). rapamycin
induced eif2a phosphorylation and lc3
(0.5 – 10 mg/ml)
conversion (fig. 7a). consequently, rapamycin inhibited the
accumulation of the triton-insoluble form of the mutant
(l1341p) dysferlin and its aggregation, and decreased the
population of cells displaying mutant dysferlin aggregates
from 38 to 18% (fig. 7b), while 3-methyladenine (3-ma),
which stimulates the autophagy formation, increased them
from 36 to 44% (fig. 7c).
collectively, we propose two erad models for dysferlin
degradation, ubiquitin/proteasome erad(i) and autophagy/
lysosome erad(ii) (fig. 8).

has been shown (1,2). most of overexpressed dysferlin were
located in the er/golgi but not located at the plasma mem-
brane (fig. 1), suggesting that only small amount of dysferlin
is necessary for cells, and unnecessary or misfolded dysferlin
is checked by protein quality control system for degradation.
lll as well as polyq aggregates induces the accumulation
of tet-wt-dysferlin in the er and the co-aggregation with
polyubiquitination (fig. 2), suggesting that wt-dysferlin is a
substrate for ubiquitin/proteasome erad. vcp(p97) func-
tions to extract aberrant proteins from the retrotranslocon

them towards ubiquitin/

vcp(p97) (fig. 1) may cause the preferential extraction of
excess wt- and some mutant-dysferlin from the er in order
for degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome erad can
occur. otherwise, wt-dysferlin may be more susceptible to
the degradation by ubiquitin/proteasome
than proteins
located in the lumen of the er, because dysferlin with the
structure of type ii membrane protein and a carboxy-terminal
transmembrane region is assumed to be located on the er
membrane exposing its most part
to the cytoplasm. this
may be another reason that the speciﬁc loss of the mutant dys-
ferlin is frequently observed in the muscle of the lgmd2b/

conserved positions,
implying an important structural role
for this amino acid. one possible explanation for the aggrega-
tion of the mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin in the er is that the loss
of function of the c2 domain may cause a defect of association
between the mutant dysferlin and the retrotranslocon or
vcp(p97). alternatively, the mutation (l1341p) may cause
deleterious effects on the secondary and tertiary structure of
dysferlin, resulting in a resistance to the ubiquitin/proteasome
erad and a tendency to spontaneously aggregate in the er.

dysferlin aggregates inhibit the proteasome activity in the
cytoplasm, causing the accumulation of mutant dysferlin and
stimulating their further aggregation on the er. detailed
analysis of the relationship between the structures of various
mutant dysferlins and their susceptibilities to the degradation
and their abilities to the inhibition of the proteasome activity

dation of misfolded proteins, while mutant dysferlin has
higher tendency to spontaneously aggregate in the er. it is
highly likely that
the accumulation of misfolded proteins
including misfolded dysferlin caused by lll treatment or
malfolded mutant dysferlin induces er stress and stimulates
lc3 conversion and the autophagic pathway to eliminate
these aberrant aggregates (figs 3 and 4). e64d/pepstatin a,
lysosomal protease inhibitors, did not stimulate the prominent
accumulation of wt-dysferlin (figs 2 and 4), but stimulated
mutant dysferlin accumulation (fig. 4), suggesting that
wt-dysferlin is mainly degraded by ubiquitin/proteasome
erad, while mutant dysferlin is degraded in the lysosome
in addition to ubiquitin/proteasome erad.
autophagy usually plays a role in the degradation of cellu-
lar organs under critical conditions. however, constitutive
autophagy, which occurs independent of nutrient stress, has
been recently shown to play an important role in maintaining
the homeostasis of non-dividing cells including hepatocytes
and a subset of neural cells; the ubiquitinated proteins are
accumulated in the liver and brain of the atg7- and/or atg5-
deﬁcient mice (21 – 23). in the yeast, atg6/beclin, which is
involved in vesicle nucleation for autophagy by associating
with pi3k as a type i complex (40), inhibits the aggregation
of the a-protease inhibitor (a1piz) in the er and rescued
the erad defect (41). an a-proteinase inhibitor extracted
from the er is degraded by two functionally distinct degra-
dation pathways in yeast: the soluble inhibitor is degraded
by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, whereas the inhibitor
that aggregated due to an erad defect is degraded by auto-
phagy/lysosome.
inhibition of lysosomal proteases, e64d/pepstatin a (42),
and atg5 deﬁciency stimulated mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin
aggregation in the mammalian cells (figs 4 and 6), suggesting
that the autophagy/lysosome pathway, an alternative erad
system, is further stimulated by mutant dysferlin aggregates
in the er for their degradation; i.e. when mutant or aberrant
dysferlins are not sufﬁciently degraded by ubiquitin/protea-
some erad, they spontaneously aggregate on the er mem-
brane and may stimulate the autophagy/lysosome pathway as
an alternative erad to engulf them for further degradation
in lysosome (fig. 8).
interestingly, atg5 deﬁciency also stimulated the aggrega-
tion of wt-dysferlin (fig. 6a and supplementary material,
fig. s5); the population of cells displaying wt-dysferlin aggre-
gation was increased from 13 to 20% by atg5 deﬁciency.
thus, the constitutive autophagy seems to play a role in the
figure 7. effect of rapamycin or 3-ma on the mutant dysferlin aggregates.
(a) rapamycin-induced lc3 conversion and eif2a phosphorylation. c2c5
cells were incubated with rapamycin at the indicated concentration (0.5 –
10 mg/ml). stimulation of eif2a phosphorylation and lc3 conversion by
rapamycin was examined. effect of rapamycin (b) or 3-ma (c) on the
mutant dysferlin aggregation. mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin was transfected
into c2c5 cells and incubated in the presence or absence of rapamycin
(10 mg/ml) or 3-ma (10 mm). accumulation of mutant dysferin was detected
by immunostaining (left), by counting the number of cells showing mutant
dysferlin aggregates using anti-dysferlin (right and upper panel). triton
insoluble-mutant dysferlin was detected by immunoblot analysis (right and
lower panel). arrowheads indicate cells showing the mutant dysferlin aggre-
gates and/or cell shrinkage with apoptotic features. scale bar, 25 mm. error
bars indicate standard deviation.
furthermore, these mutant dysferlin aggregates induced the
coaggregation of the gfp-polyq11 located in the cytoplasm
with polyubiquitination (supplementary material, fig. s3)
and polyq72 aggregates induced the wt-dysferlin aggregation

figure 8. model for the autophagy/lysosome erad system. wt-dysferlin is located in the er and golgi and some of them are transported to the surface mem-
brane and play a role in the vesicular membrane fusion system. usually, wt- and mutant dysferlin are degraded by ubiquitin/proteasome erad system. however,
when mutant dysferlin is not sufﬁciently degraded by ubiquitin/proteasome erad, they aggregate in the er and stimulate autophagy formation, lc3 conversion,
via the er stress-perk-eif2aphosphorylation. the mutant dysferlin aggregates on the er membrane could be recognized by the elongating membrane to form
the autophagosome and then degraded by autolysosome on the fusion with lysosome. thus, autophagy/lysosome pathway acts as erad( ii), an alternative
erad, for the degradation of the mutant dysferlin aggregates when the ubiquitin/proteasome erad(i) is impaired. however, if autophagy/lysosome
erad(ii) insufﬁciently degrades the mutant dysferlin aggregates, cells may choose the er stress-mediated cell death.
clearance of some of the misfolded dysferlin included in
wt-dysferlin as a protein-quality control system although this
contribution to the degradation of wt-dysferlin is much less
than ubiquitin/proteasome (fig. 4a). in contrast, e64d/pepsta-
tin a does not increase the accumulation of the wt-dysferlin
(figs 2 and 4b), suggesting that constitutive autophagy may
not be always associated with lysosomal degradation but
may be associated with clearance system or wt-dysferlin
may be degraded by the e64d/pepstatin a-insensitive
proteases.
regulation of autophagy formation by eif2a
phosphorylation
eif2a phosphorylation is known to be involved in the
stress-induced autophagy (24,28); starvation stimulates autop-
hagy formation via eif2a phosphorylation (28). recently, we
showed that serum deprivation and rapamycin-induced lc3
conversion via a perk-independent eif2a phosphorylation-
dependent pathway (15,24). as we describe here, er stress
inducing stimuli such as thapsigargin as well as polyq aggre-
gates induces lc3 conversion via perk-eif2a phosphoryl-
ation pathway (fig. 5a and b) (24). thus, it is likely that
the mutant dysferlin aggregates in the er may induce the
autophagosome formation for the activation of the alternative
erad pathway, via stimulation of the er stress-perk/eif2a
phosphorylation pathway (fig. 8). furthermore, eif2a depho-
sphorylation and atg5 deﬁciency stimulated the accumulation
of mutant (l1341p)-dysferlin (fig. 6), suggesting that er
stress-eif2a phosphorylation may also regulate the autolyso-
some formation, the fusion process of autophagosome with
lysosome. rapamycin seems to be helpful for the degradation
of the aberrant protein aggregates including mutant dysferlin
in the autophagy/lysosome (fig. 7) and for cell survival
because it stimulates autophagosome formation via non-er
stress-eif2a phosphorylation pathway (24).
in conclusion, we propose two erad models for dys-
the ubiquitin/proteasome erad(i) and
ferlin degradation,
the autophagy/lysosome erad(ii)
(fig. 8). autophagy/
lysosome erad(ii) is an alternative erad system for the
degradation of excess mutant dysferlin when the ubiquitin/pro-
teasome erad(i) is impaired. mutant (l1341p) dysferlin
aggregates on the er membrane stimulate autophagosome
formation via activating er stress-eif2a phosphorylation.
it is formally possible that autophagy/lysosome erad(ii)
degrades other aberrant proteins when ubiquitin/proteasome
erad(i) is impaired.
