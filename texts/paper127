proteins regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mtor), as well as some of the targets of the mtor
kinase, are overexpressed or mutated in cancer. rapa-
mycin, the naturally occurring inhibitor of mtor, along
with a number of recently developed rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs) consisting of synthetically derived compounds
containing minor chemical modiﬁcations to the parent
structure, inhibit the growth of cell lines derived from
multiple tumor types in vitro, and tumor models in vivo.
results from clinical trials indicate that the rapalogs may
be useful for the treatment of subsets of certain types of
cancer. the sporadic responses from the initial clinical
trials, based on the hypothesis of general translation
inhibition of cancer cells are now beginning to be
understood owing to a more complete understanding of
the dynamics of mtor regulation and the function of
mtor in the tumor microenvironment. this review will
summarize the preclinical and clinical data and recent
discoveries of the function of mtor in cancer and growth
regulation.

mtor activation and cancer
the signaling pathways that activate mammalian target
of rapamycin (mtor) are altered in many human
cancers. the ampliﬁcation of
the genomic region
containing pik3ca, the gene coding for the p110 alpha
subunit of phosphatidylinositol 30-kinase (pi3k), has
been identiﬁed in 40% of the cases of ovarian cancer
(shayesteh et al., 1999). activating mutations may occur
in as many as 35% of the cases of breast cancer and is
associated with a poor prognosis (li et al., 2006).
modiﬁcations of pik3ca have also been identiﬁed in
colon, brain and lung cancers (samuels et al., 2004).
the dual function phosphatase that negatively reg-
ulates pi3k, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted

deleted in a number of tumor types including glioblas-
toma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung carcinoma, mela-
noma, endometrial carcinomas and prostate cancer
(li et al., 1997; risinger et al., 1997; steck et al.,
1997). these changes result in constitutive activation of
akt and consequently mtor signaling.
inactivating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase
11 (stk11/lkb1) gene are associated with the peutz-
jeghers cancer prone syndrome (giardiello et al., 1987).
the lkb1 kinase activates the adenosine monophos-
phate (amp)-dependent kinase (ampk) which in
response to low energy levels inhibits the function of
mtor via tuberous sclerosis complex protein 2 (tsc2)
(shaw et al., 2004). the observed mutations in peutz-
jeghers result in a failure to inhibit mtor under low
energy conditions (shaw et al., 2004).
mutations in the tsc protein, tsc2, which inhibits
mtor function under hypoxic conditions as well as
conditions of energy deprivation,
leads to tuberous
sclerosis syndrome (inoki et al., 2003; liu et al., 2006).
this syndrome is associated with well-vascularized
hamartomas (benign lesions) as well as an increased
risk of renal cell carcinoma (rcc) (yeung et al., 1994;
kwiatkowski, 2003).
cancer related changes in mtor kinase substrates
and their associated proteins are also reported. for
instance, s6k1 is overexpressed or constitutively active
in several tumor cell lines, and in the early stages of
transformation in ovarian surface epithelium with
brca1 mutations (wong et al., 2001). s6k1 is also
ampliﬁed in some breast carcinomas (couch et al.,
1999). generally, for tumors that have an ampliﬁcation
of s6k1, there is a corresponding increase in the level of
s6k1 protein (couch et al., 1999).
the gene coding for eukaryotic initiation factor 4e
(eif4e) that is positively regulated by mtor, is altered
in a number of tumors. progressive ampliﬁcation of the
eif4e gene is associated with late-stage head and neck
carcinoma, ductal cell breast carcinoma and thyroid
carcinoma (sorrells et al., 1999; haydon et al., 2000;
wang et al., 2001). levels of eif4e are elevated in
some colon carcinomas in comparison to normal colon
cells (rosenwald et al., 1999; berkel et al., 2001). the
levels of eif4e are also increased in some bladder
and breast cancers that have a poor outcome (crew
et al., 2000; li et al., 2002). in these cancers, a
corresponding increase in vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf) was also observed (scott et al., 1998;
crew et al., 2000).
in a lymphomagenesis mouse model, when myc is
overexpressed in lympohoid tissue eif4e cooperates
with c-myc in the genesis of b-cell lymphoma, accele-
rating the formation of tumors (wendel et al., 2004).
when the myc mice were crossed with p537 mice the
incidence of lymphoma was increased owing to the loss
of the remaining allele, unless eif4e was overexpressed.
if eif4e is overexpressed in the p537 mice, the mice
still developed lymphomas but the wild-type p53 allele is
maintained (wendel et al., 2004). so a moderate increase
in the level of eif4e appears to abrogate the requirement
for suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis in this model
system. overexpression of eif4e also results in increased
frequency of late-onset cancers (ruggero et al., 2004).
these data point to the possibility that at least under
some conditions eif4e may act as an oncogene.
in certain types of cancer the relationship between the
levels of the mtor substrate 4ebp1, and the protein
whose function it inhibits, eif4e, might be a predictor
of metastasis. in colon carcinoma both eif4e and
4ebp1 are frequently overexpressed, but the 4ebp1
levels are the most elevated in patients that have little or
no metastatic disease (martin et al., 2000).
rapamycin analogs
treatment with rapamycin or its analogs (rapalogs)
inhibits proliferation in a large number of cell lines and
in some instances leads to apoptosis. cell lines effected
by rapamycin treatment have been derived from a
number of tumor types including rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, small-cell lung carcinoma,
osteosarcoma, pancreatic
carcinoma, rcc, ewing
sarcoma, prostate cancer and breast cancer (bjornsti
and houghton, 2004).
the rapalogs are the only speciﬁc small molecule
inhibitors of mtor yet reported. rapamycin forms a
ternary complex with fk506-binding protein (fkbp)12
and mtor, resulting in potent inhibition of mtor
signaling. structural studies indicate that
there are
relatively few contacts between the two proteins (choi
et al., 1996). fkbp12 binding to rapamycin may induce
a favorable conformation for the association of rapa-
mycin with mtor. all of the rapalogs contain relatively
minor modiﬁcations to the structure of rapamycin with
the primary advantage being increased solubility and
stability.
to date all of the compounds that have progressed to
clinical trials involve substitution at the c40 hydroxyl of
rapamycin. the majority of these compounds substitute
esters or ethers. ap23573 substitutes a phosphonate for
the c40 hydroxyl. this compound is not a prodrug but
it
inhibits mtor activity and binds fkbp12 at
concentrations similar to that of rapamycin, in contrast
to cci-779 which is a prodrug that is metabolized to
rapamcyin in the body.
current rapalogs in clinical trials include rapamycin/
(wyeth),
sirolimus
rad-001/everolimus (novartis) and ap23573 (ariad).

cellular responses to rapalogs
6437
the principal effect of rapamycin in most normal cells
and many tumor cell lines is growth retardation, but in
some tumor cell lines as well as certain primary cells
treatment with rapamycin leads to apoptosis. among
the primary cells that undergo apoptosis are certain
populations of dendritic cells, and renal tubular cells
(lieberthal et al., 2001; woltman et al., 2003). in some
instances some of mechanisms responsible for this
apoptotic effect have been characterized. it appears
that mtor-regulated components of translation and
their targets such as myc, as well as the prosurvival
properties of akt, which is also a positive regulator of
mtor are involved in this process.
myc has been proposed to have both antiapoptotic
and proapoptotic functions (secombe et al., 2004). the
translation of myc is regulated in part by m7gtp cap-
dependent mechanisms and is therefore dependent on
eif4e and sensitive to inhibitors of mtor. recent data
indicate that myc translation is also controlled by the
activity of an internal ribosome entry site (ires)
present within the promoter region. ires-dependent
translation of myc has been linked to the proapoptotic
effects of myc expression, and may be inhibited by
akt activity (stoneley et al., 2000; shi et al., 2005a).
akt is known to phosphorylate the proapoptotic
protein bad as well as gsk-3 and the foxo family of
transcription factors (cross et al., 1995; datta et al.,
1997; brunet et al., 1999). phosphorylation of bad by
akt results in its sequestration by 14-3-3 thereby
blocking its apoptotic function (zha et al., 1996). as
akt is an activating component of mtor,
it con-
tributes to downstream events such as the m7gtp
cap-dependent regulation of myc. so mutations or
ampliﬁcations that activate akt in addition to sup-
pressing the proapoptotic substrates that are directly
phosphorylated by akt also (via activation of mtor)
effect myc-dependent regulation of apoptosis. support
for this concept is provided by the em-myc mouse model
described earlier in which it was shown that inhibition of
mtor reverses the chemo resistance in lymphomas
overexpressing akt (wendel et al., 2004). the over-
expression of eif4e mimicked the chemo resistance
observed when akt was overexpressed. rapamycin
could reverse the chemo resistance in cells overexpres-
sing akt but not
the cells overexpressing eif4e.
indicating at least in this setting, the observed chemo-
resistance was dependent on mtor-dependent prosur-
vival signals.
rapamycin sensitizes multiple myeloma cell lines to
dexamethasone treatment, dramatically increasing the
degree of apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (yan et al.,
2006). the sensitivity of cells was independent of
activation of the stress pathways, bad phosphorylation,
pten, or p53 status. overexpression of a constitutively
active mutant of 4ebp1 that cannot be phosphorylated
by mtor resulted in increased sensitivity to dexa-
methasone similar to the results observed in cells treated
with rapamycin, implying that inhibition of translation
mediates this effect (yan et al., 2006).

the relationship between mtor signaling, p53, and
apoptosis has also been examined. under serum free
conditions rapamycin treatment causes apoptosis in
tumor cell lines with mutated p53. overexpression of
wild-type p53 or p21cip1 protects these cells from
rapamycin-dependent apoptosis (huang et al., 2001).
the apoptotic effect is a result of the activation of the
stress response pathway in cells treated with rapamycin,
and is also dependent on the expression of 4ebp1 and
concomitant inhibition of eif4e (huang et al., 2003).
so the activation of cap-dependent
translation is
involved in both p53- dependent and independent
mechanisms that inhibit apoptosis and promote growth
and survival of transformed cells.
murine embryo ﬁbroblasts from pten þ /  mice have
increased levels of phosphorylated 4ebp1 and active
s6k, which is consistent with increased mtor signaling
(podsypanina et al., 2001). some pten /  tumor cell
lines are extremely sensitive to apoptosis, and it has been
proposed that this effect is from a dependence on the
increased pi3k activity and subsequent mtor activity
in pten /  cells during tumor development (neshat
et al., 2001). similarly, multiple myeloma cells and
glioblastoma cell
lines lacking pten appear more
sensitive to rapalogs, although there are exceptions.
the dependence of
transformed cells on pathway
mutations that provide a growth advantage as part of
the transformation process has been termed ‘oncogene
addiction’ (weinstein, 2002).
appears to be a signiﬁcant contributor to the block in
cell proliferation observed in vivo and in some cell lines
treated with rapalogs (barata et al., 2001; law et al.,
2002). if a constitutively active form of 4ebp1 is
expressed in mcf7 breast cancer cells the level of
p27kip1 increases and proliferation is inhibited indicating
is regulated in part by cap-
that control of p27kip1
dependent translation (bader et al., 2003).
bone marrow malignancies display an angiogenic
phenotype with increased numbers of bone marrow
endothelial cells (lyden et al., 2001). stimulation of
bone marrow endothelial cells with growth factors or
association of these cells with leukemia cells activates
mtor, resulting in phosphorylation of the mtor
substrates 4e-bp1 and s6k1. rapamycin, or cci-779
signiﬁcantly inhibits growth factor and leukemia-depen-
dent proliferation of bone marrow endothelium by
inducing g0/g1 cell cycle arrest. this effect is correlated
with a downregulation of cyclin d1 and upregulation of
the cdk inhibitors p27kip1 and p21cip1 (costa et al.,
2006).
the extent of the g1 arrest resulting from rapamycin
treatment varies between cell lines. this is likely to be a
function of both cell type and the genetic modiﬁcations
present in the cell
line. however, the above results
indicate that certain tumor types as well as certain types
of primary cells that support tumorogenesis may be
inhibited by treatment with rapalogs (figure 1).
mtor and cell proliferation
cancer stem cells and mtor

in its activated state, mtor, as part of mtorc1
complex, phosphorylates 4ebp1, allowing for efﬁcient
m7gtp cap-dependent translation. inhibiting mtor
results in a block of phosphorylation of 4ebp1 resulting
in sequestration of eif4e and a failure to form the
m7gtp cap-dependent preinitiation complex, greatly
reducing translation of m7gtp cap containing tran-
scripts. many of these m7gtp cap-containing tran-
scripts

including ornithine decarboxylase and
cyclin d (shantz and pegg, 1994; rosenwald, 1996).
several lines of evidence indicate that inhibiting this
mechanism of translational control contributes to the
resulting from mtor inhibition.
cytostatic effects
tumor cell
lines that overexpress eif4e are able to
partially overcome the effects of the g1 delay induced
by rapamycin (dilling et al., 2002). in cell lines selected
for resistance to rapamycin, 4ebp1 levels are reduced
thereby creating a stoichometric deﬁcit with eif4e and
relieving inhibition of eif4e. cells that have reverted
back to rapamycin sensitivity have levels of 4ebp1
similar to those observed in wild-type cells (dilling et al.,
2002).
the inhibition of mtor leads to increased levels of
the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) inhibitor, p27kip1,
an inhibitor of g1-s cell cycle progression (nourse
et al., 1994; law et al., 2002). induction of p27kip1
oncogene
the idea that tumors arise from a rare population of
self-renewing cancer stem cells capable of generating a
hierarchy of more differentiated cells with limited
potential to replicate was ﬁrst demonstrated in leukemia
(lapidot et al., 1994). this population is highly enriched
when sorted using markers that identify hematopoietic
stem cells (flk2  sca-1 þ lin  c-kit þ cd48 ). when
these cells were isolated from human patients and then
introduced
immunodeﬁcient
(scid) mice it was found that the leukemia with its
various hierarchy of differentiated cells was reproduced.
if leukemic cells from patients outside of this ‘stem cell’
population were introduced into mice it rarely led to
leukemia.

more recently a leukemia mouse model was devel-
oped where pten was conditionally deleted from
hematopoietic cells. if the pten tumor suppressor is
inactivated in hematopoietic cells in adult mice, these
mice immediately developed myeloproliferative disease
and go on to develop leukemia in 4–6 weeks (yilmaz
et al., 2006). immediately after the conditional deletion
of pten, there was a dramatic but transient prolifera-
tion of hematopoietic stem cells. when these cells were
transplanted into irradiated mice, they were unable to
stably reconstitute the hematopoietic program indicat-
ing that the pten deleted stem cell population is limited
in its ability to self-renew. however, if the transfer of the

donor mice had developed leukemia, the scid-recipient
mice also develop leukemia. introduction of the non-
stem leukemic cells resulted in a much lower rate of
leukemic development in the recipient mice. as the
deletion of pten effectively mimics the overexpression
of pi3k, a number of possible pi3k-dependent func-
tions could be responsible for this effect. thus, the
contribution of mtor to the genesis of these effects
might be anticipated to be limited. surprisingly, the
inhibition of mtor by rapamycin was sufﬁcient to
dramatically reduce the effects on stem cell prolifera-
tion, and leukemia development resulting from the
pten deletion. both the myeloproliferative phenotype
as well as the development of leukemias was blocked in
mice treated with rapamycin. the transient proliferation
of hematopoietic stem cells upon pten deletion was
also abrogated. perhaps most signiﬁcant was that
hematopoietic stem cells transplanted into irradiated
mice treated with rapamycin were able to reconstitute
the hematopoietic population in the donor animals
indicating that there was a selective inhibition of the
cancer stem cells and not a general inhibition of all stem
cells. these results imply that
it may possible to
selectively target certain populations of cancer stem
cells that have alterations in receptor kinase signaling
using mtor inhibitors, even though they have many of
the same properties of the stem cells they are derived
from or resemble (figure 1).
mtor, autophagy and cancer
the
autophagy is clearly implicated in the genesis of cancer.
both tumor derived cells and transformed cells exhibit
lower levels of protein turnover than their normal cell
counterparts. although a reduction in autophagy
appears to be common in tumor cells, some level of
autophagy may be required for the development of
cancer. evidence for this is provided in breast cancer
in which one copy of the essential autophagy gene
becn1, which codes for the protein beclin 1,
is
frequently deleted, while
remaining copy of
becn1 is wild-type, indicating that beclin 1 may
be acting as a haploinsufﬁcent oncogene (liang et al.,
1999). further conﬁrmation that beclin 1 acts
as a haploinsufﬁcent oncogene is provided by a mouse
model where deletion of one allele of becn1 resulted
in an increased incidence of
lung cancer, hepato-
cellular carcinoma and lymphoma (yue et al., 2003).
interestingly, this is a similar spectrum of tumors as
shown to arise in transgenic mice overexpressing
eif4e (ruggero et al., 2004). in mammals beclin 1
was originally identiﬁed as a protein interacting with
the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 (liang et al., 1998).
recent experiments indicate that bcl-2 is a potential-
negative regulator of beclin-1, implying a relation-
ship between autophagy and apoptosis
(pattingre
et al., 2005).

is
inhibited.
the role of mtor in autophagy is conserved from
yeast to mammals where it acts to regulate the induction
of the autophagic process (noda and ohsumi, 1998;
levine and klionsky, 2004). if mtor is inactive
autophagy proceeds, and conversely, when mtor is
activated the autophagic process
in
mammals this process may be mediated in part through
mtor-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic trans-
lation elongation factor 2 kinase (eef-2k). the chain
promoting activity of activity of eef-2 is inhibited when
eef-2 is phosphoryated by eef-2k. phosphorylation
of eef-2k by mtor-dependent pathways inhibits
eef-2k acitivity. in glioblastoma cell lines the knockdown
of eef-2k by rna interference (rnai) inhibits auto-
phagy whereas the overexpression of eef-2k increases
autophagy (wu et al., 2006). hence the inhibition of
mtor results
the
inhibition of eef-2 and induction of autophagy.
perhaps one reason that activating mutations of mtor
have not been observed in tumors is that this results in a
reduced level of autophagy that may be required to
promote survival of tumor cells in later stages of tumor
development were energy and nutrients may be limited.
however, in breast cancer uncoupling oxygen-respon-
sive signaling pathways from mtor function may
abrogate control of protein synthesis mediated by this
pathway (connolly et al., 2006).
in the activation of eef-2k,
treatment with many of the chemotherapy agents
currently in use, or with radiation therapy results in the
formation autophagosomes in tumor cells (bursch et al.,
1996; paglin et al., 2001; kanzawa et al., 2004). what
has not yet been resolved is whether this increase in
autophagasomes is a survival mechanism to sequester
damaged organelles, or part of an autophagic precursor
to apoptotic, or non-apoptotic cell death. for instance,
treatment of the mcf-7 breast cancer cell line with
tamoxifen increases the levels of autophagy and cell
death (bursch et al., 1996). both cell death and
autophagy can be inhibited by the addition of the
class-iii-pi3k inhibitor 3-methyladenine that functions
by blocking preautophagosome formation (bursch
et al., 1996). the implication of this data is that a block
in the formation of autophagic bodies is sufﬁcient to
inhibit the action of the antiestrogen. when mcf-7 cells
are modiﬁed to overexpress akt they become more
resistant to tamoxifen, but sensitivity to tamoxifen can
restored if
the cells are treated with rapamycin
(degraffenried et al., 2004). gamma-irradiation of
mcf 7 breast cancer cells promotes the formation of
autophagosomes and cell death (paglin et al., 2001).
irradiation of these cells inhibits phosphorylation of
4ebp1 and p70s6k1 (paglin et al., 2005). rapamycin
treatment of these tumor cells also promoted autophagy,
and combining rapamycin with gamma irradiation
resulted in an increase in the amount of cell death.
the constitutive expression of akt1 in the luminal
epithelial cells of the mouse ventral prostate rapidly
in the development of a highly penetrant
results
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (pin)
(majumder
et al., 2004). this akt1 induced pin phenotype is
completely dependent on mtor. when the mice are
oncogene
the transcriptional
treated with the mtor inhibitor rad001, there is a
rapid loss of
intraluminal epithelial cells, marked
apoptosis, and a reversal of the pin phenotype within
14 days. although hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha
(hif1 alpha) appears to be both the principal mediator
of
response to elevated akt1
activity leading to pin, and the target of rad001-
dependent inhibition of tumor development; the apop-
totic component, and the growth inhibitory component
may be controlled by a different mechanisms. over-
expression of bcl2 in these cells blocked the apoptotic
effects of rad001, but did not overcome the inhibition
of proliferation. this raises the question as to whether
inhibition of beclin 1 by bcl2 and the consequent
inhibition of autophagy might contribute to the block in
rad001 apoptosis. this would imply that the induction
of autophagy resulting from mtor inhibition would be
secondary to the inhibition resulting from downregula-
tion of beclin 1. of course, an alternative explanation
would be that overexpression of bcl2 counteracts the
activation of any proapoptotic proteins that might
interact with bcl2 thereby promoting survival.
the above results imply that the use of rapamycin to
increase autophagy might be useful in facilitating the
effectiveness of other chemotherapeutic agents, but a
great deal more work needs to be done to verify this
effect in vivo.
hypoxia the tumor microenvironment and mtor
if cells in culture are exposed to hypoxic conditions,
mtor activity is rapidly inhibited, as measured by
both autophosphorylation of mtor, and phosphoryla-
tion of the mtor substrates s6k1 and 4ebp1 (arsham
et al., 2003). hypoxia inhibits eif2 and eef2, as
well as the mtor targets 4ebp1, p70s6k and rps6
(liu et al., 2006). initial reports indicated that inhibition
of mtor under hypoxic conditions was the result of
the hif1 alpha-dependent transcript, redd1, which
functions in a tsc2-dependent manner (brugarolas
et al., 2004). more recent reports indicate that there
is also a hif-1 alpha/redd1-independent mechanism
that
involves activation of ampk. the activation
of ampk results in the phosphorylation of tsc2
and inhibition of
the mtor activator, rheb
(liu et al., 2006). the function of ampk within the
cell
is to sense low energy levels as deﬁned by the
amount of cellular amp. the data indicating that
hypoxia is acting in these cells through ampk links the
mechanism by which cellular energy levels and hypoxia
regulate mtor. however, recent data suggest that
breast cancer cells acquire resistance to hypoxia by
uncoupling oxygen-responsive signaling pathways (e.g.
tsc2) from mtor function, thus abrogating control
of protein synthesis mediated by 4e-bp1 and eef2
(connolly et al., 2006).
the relative contribution of the hif1alpha/redd1/
tsc2 and ampk/tsc2 to the inhibition of mtor
may depend upon the cellular context. in cancers such
as rcc as many as 50% of the tumors have inactivating
mutations in von hippel-lindau tumor suppressor
(vhl) that result in a reduction or elemination of its
ability to degrade hif1 alpha (kim and kaelin, 2004)
under normal oxygen levels. in isogenic pairs of rcc
cell lines, a reduction in the level of vhl by rnai
resulted in an increase in the amount hif1 alpha
protein levels and increased rates of cell proliferation
when compared with a scrambled small interfering rna
control (thomas et al., 2006). the levels of vegf, a
hif1 alpha-regulated gene were increased not only
under hypoxic conditions but also under normoxic
conditions. the treatment of cell
lines expressing
reduced levels of vhl with cci-779 resulted in 70%
reduction in growth. this growth inhibitory effect was
not observed in the cells in which vhl proteins were
not downregulated.
in
scid mice, cell
lines with a knockdown of vhl
conferred a growth advantage and increased sensitivity
to mtor inhibition, even though there was efﬁcient
biochemical blockade of mtor in both the expressing
and vhl knockdown tumors. vegf levels were
increased in vhl knockdown cells, and reduced by
cci-779 treatment in vitro and in vivo. this effect
correlated with inhibition of hif1 alpha expression, and
the expression of hif1 alpha mutants defective in vhl
binding which suppressed the tumor inhibitory effects of
cci-779.
in subcutaneous xenografts
the extent of mtor inhibition under hypoxic
conditions is not as great as is observed when the cells
expressing low levels of vhl are treated with cci-779
(treins et al., 2002). this incomplete inhibition of
mtor under hypoxia has been proposed as an
explanation as to why the hif1 alpha is still activated
under hypoxic conditions. the 50top-containing se-
quence present in the hif1 alpha transcript contributes
to inhibition of hif1 alpha expression by rapamycin.
eliminating the 50top sequence in the hif1 alpha
sequence rescues the cells from the growth inhibitory
effects of cci-779.
in contrast to the above reports, it was found that
murine lewis lung carcinoma cells are protected from
massive cell death at high densities under hypoxic
conditions by the addition of rapamycin. these rapa-
mycin-treated cells had much higher levels of adenosine
triphosphate (atp) and moderately higher levels of
glucose under hypoxic conditions than the untreated
cells (hamanaka et al., 2005). autophagy might also
be a possible contributor to this survival, but regardless
of
there
may be tissue- or species-speciﬁc differences in the
response to rapalog treatment under conditions of
cellular stress.
the mechanism this
indicates
result
that
one of the questions raised from the above data is
whether there are classes of cells in vivo whose growth is
absolutely dependent on mtor-mediated regulation of
hif-1 alpha and whether these cells are cancer cells, or
stromal cells supporting tumor growth. there is now
accumulating evidence that the tumor-inhibitory actions
of rapamycins in vivo may be in part due to antiangio-
genic activity (guba et al., 2002).

thus, inhibition of mtor can have direct effects on
tumor cells manifest by slowing proliferation, increasing
apoptosis or inhibiting tumor-derived vascular endothe-
lial growth factor (vegf), or indirect effects on tumor
cells by directly targeting the proliferation and survival
of vascular and smooth muscle stromal cells.

mtor inhibitors: results from clinical trials
a number of clinical trials with the rapalogs have now
been completed. the phase i trial evaluating the
safety of cci-779 was examined for both daily and
weekly intravenous (i.v.) treatment in patients with a
number of different types of tumors (dancey, 2002).
the results indicated that with daily i.v. treatment there
are signiﬁcant grade 3 toxicities, including hypocalcae-
mia, vomiting, thrombocytopenia and increase in the
level of hepatic transaminases. one patient had an
objective response (non-small-cell carcinoma), whereas
a number of patients had minor responses or stable
disease
carcinoma,
rcc and soft tissue sarcoma). on a weekly treatment
schedule patients experienced no grade 3 toxicities
regardless of dosage. three patients had a partial
tumor regression (renal cell, neuroendecrine and breast
carcinomas).
carcinoma,
(cervical
uterine
based on the phase i results a number of phase ii
trials were initiated to study the effects
treating
advanced stage refractory rcc, refractory mantle cell
lymphoma and refractory metastatic breast cancer with
cci-779 (atkins et al., 2004; chan et al., 2005; witzig
et al., 2005).
the completed trials for rcc yielded an objective
response rate of 5–7%, a minor response rate of
26–29%, and stable disease in approximately 40% of
the patients (atkins et al., 2004). treatment is associated
with a increase in survival time of approximately 4
months.
the phase ii trial for mantle cell lymphoma consisted
of weekly treatment with 250 mg (ﬁxed dose) of cci-779
i.v., resulted in an overall response rate of 38%, (3%
complete response, and 35% partial response) with a
median time to progression of 6.9 months in responders
versus 6.5 months for all patients treated (witzig et al.,
2005).
for the phase ii trial
in pretreated patients with
advanced breast cancer dosages of 75 mg or 250 mg of
cci-779 were given i.v. weekly. the overall response
rate of 9.2%, (all partial responses) was similar for
both dosage levels but toxicity was decreased in the
patients treated with the 75 mg dosage (chan et al.,
2005). cci-779 appears to have signiﬁcant activity
in endometrial cancer,
irrespective of pten status,
yielding objective responses in 25% of patients, and
causing disease stabilization in over half of the patients
on study.
results from the initial dose ﬁnding and safety trials
for rad001 indicated that the drug is generally well
tolerated with effects on tumors similar to that observed
for cci-779.

these initial results prompted the development of a
number of additional phase ii trials for various types of
cancer for both rad001 and cci-779. these include
trials for breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic
cancer, malignant gliomas, leukemia, lymphoma, mul-
tiple myeloma, melanoma and rcc (summarized in
table 1).
as rapamycin cannot be given parenterally there are
fewer trials examining its efﬁcacy, however, there is an
ongoing phase ii trial examining the effect of rapamycin
treatment on refractory rcc as well as a phase i trial
establishing safety in treatment of pediatric patients with
refractory acute leukemia or lymphoma.
for ap23573 there is currently a phase i trial to
determine the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) by oral
administration in advanced cancers, and phase ii
evaluation against sarcomas. there are also trials to
determine the maximum oral tolerated dose in combina-
tion with doxorubicin in the treatment of sarcomas, as
well as a trial to determince the mtd dose in patients
with multiple myelomas, and a phase ii trial of patients
with recurrent endometrial cancer. phase ii results
suggest signiﬁcant activity against various subtypes of
sarcoma.
phase iii trials are in progress to test the efﬁcacy of
cci-779 either alone or in combination with inter-
feron-a as a ﬁrst-line treatment of rcc, and the use of the
oral form of cci-779 in combination with the aromatase
inhibitor letrozole for the treatment of locally advanced or
metastatic breast cancer.
targeting mtor or the mtor pathway?
many of so called ‘molecularly targeted’ therapies in
preclinical and clinical development that target signaling
pathways may also inhibit mtor activity. thus, is there
potential beneﬁt in inhibiting multiple sites within the
mtor pathway over that of inhibiting only mtor
per se? the answer is likely to depend on the properties
of the individual tumor.
include
the
pathway strategies
small molecule
receptor inhibitors such as the igf1r inhibitor nv-
aew541 as well as neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
against receptors such as those directed against the
igf-1 receptor. the logic of this approach is that tumor
cells that overexpress these receptors have become
the so
dependent on their activation for survival,
called ‘oncogene addiction’. unfortunately,
targeted
therapy data indicates that this does not necessarily
hold true for all cancers, or possibly the correct
target has not been identiﬁed. however, this strategy
may still be successful for some receptors and subsets of
cancers.
other strategies target a speciﬁc cellular function
common to many receptors. for instance the small
molecule inhibitors of akt not only inhibit the direct
prosurvival
functions of akt that are mediated
through a number of receptors, they also potently
inhibit the activation of mtor, at least in the context of
mtorc1 (thimmaiah et al., 2005). preclinical data
indicates that this strategy may prove effective; espe-
cially in cells were pten is deleted and akt is
constitutively activated.
inhibitors for proteins with broader functions in
receptor activation, such as pi3k, have also been
developed. but as the cellular function becomes more
universal, the risk of toxicity increases, and this toxicity
combined with solubility issues have inhibited the
development of this class of compounds.
so is there any advantage to inhibiting mtor
directly, given that mtor inhibition in most instances

is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic? as described above
there are in vitro and in vivo models where mtor
inhibitors act through both cytostatic and cytotoxic
mechanisms. examples include models for some types
of leukemia, prostate neoplasms and rccs. although
this represents a subset of these cancers in each case,
this therapy may prove effective in these cases if
the properties of the sensitive tumors can be fully
characterized.
recent clinical results indicate that in tumor tissue
from patients receiving rad001 there is hyperpho-
sphorylation of akt (o’reilly et al., 2006). this appears
to be a consequence of increased stability of irs-1, and
upregulation of igf-1 signaling. speciﬁc inhibition of
igf-i receptor in conjunction with rad001 led to
increased apoptosis, particularly in pten-deﬁcient
cells. also given the high level of speciﬁcity of the
rapalogs and their cytostatic properties, they may prove
effective in combination with other therapeutic drugs.
combination of mtor inhibitors with agents used in ﬁrst
line therapy
a number of approaches with combination therapy
targeting different signaling pathways are possible.
for proliferation-dependent or s-phase-speciﬁc cyto-
toxic agents, the anticipated result would be antago-
nism if rapalogs arrest cells in g1 phase. however,
treatment with rapamycin followed by the timed
addition of drugs targeting s phase such as irinotecan
may have additive effect in tumors, and recent data
suggest that mtor may play a role in determining
cellular responses to dna damage, at least in yeast. for
tumors where treatment with mtor inhibitors may
cause a general slowing of growth, concomitant therapy
with compounds such as interferon-a or other com-
pounds inducing general apoptosis may prove more
appropriate. this combination is currently a component
of the current phase iii trials to determine efﬁcacy of
cci-779 alone or combined with interferon-a (standard
of care) in the treatment of rcc.
in multiple myeloma cell lines and cells from patients,
treatment with the combination of cc-5013 (lenalido-
mide), a thalidomide derivative, and rapamycin resulted
in a synergistic apoptotic effect (raje et al., 2004). this
combination of drugs was also able to overcome growth
advantages conferred by the addition of growth factors,
growth on stromal cells, or drug resistance. although,
cci-5013 and rapamycin appear to have somewhat
similar physiological effects (immune modulator, and
antiangiogenic), the mechanism of action of these drugs
appears to be through different pathways, perhaps
accounting for their synergistic effects (raje et al., 2004).
for chronic myeloid leukemia patients that have
developed resistance to imatinib, in the vast majority of
cases the resistance is the result of a point mutation in
bcr-abl (gorre et al., 2001). activation of
the
tyrosine kinase fusion product bcr-abl is absolutely
required for the development of this type of leukemia,
and molecularly deﬁnes this disease. as the activity of
tor and cancer therapy
jb easton and pj houghton
bcr-abl is dependent on up regulation of pi3k
activity and its downstream effectors, mtor inhibitors
might be predicted have a signiﬁcant effect in either
stabilizing or regressing leukemias that have acquired
bcr-abl mutations. recent preclinical data has added
support to this hypothesis (mohi et al., 2004).
another possible approach to targeting the same
pathway would be to target both proteins simulta-
neously in ﬁrst line treatment to reduce the likelihood of
developing resistant tumor cells. in the case of imatinib
this would be accomplished by slowing proliferation of
the initial tumor cell population by cotreatment with
rapamycin.
when targeting multiple proteins in the same pathway
to bypass drug resistance, it is important to determine if
the second drug eliminates the effects of the mutation
creating the resistance. a good example of the im-
portance of this effect is illustrated by preclinical studies
using the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor
geﬁtinib, and rapamycin in rcc cell lines where it was
discovered that these two agents acted synergistically to
inhibit cell growth only in cell lines that contained the
wild-type e3 ubiquitin ligase complex protein, vhl
(gemmill et al., 2005). however, caution should be
used, as
signaling pathways
(erbb1/mtor) would be anticipated to have effects in
normal tissues. indeed the combination of rad001 and
erlotinib, another erbb1 inhibitor, causes considerable
toxicity manifest by severe mucositis.
inhibiting two major
inhibition of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway sensi-
tizes tumor vasculature to radiation (edwards et al.,
2002). recently it has been determined that mtor
inhibitors also sensitizes tumor vasculature to ionizing
radiation (shinohara et al., 2005) (figure 1). indicating
that
some types of cancer combining mtor
inhibitors with radiation may have some efﬁcacy as a
radiosensitizing agent.
for
non-rapalog inhibitors of mtor
currently, no speciﬁc inhibitors of mtor that are not
based on rapamycin have been described. the most
common target for small molecule inhibitors of kinases
is the atp binding pocket. the catalytic domain (cd)
of mtor contains autophosphorylation sites as well as
the atp binding site. small molecules that target the
atp binding site of mtor would almost certainly
inhibit the function of mtor in the context of both
torc1 and torc2.
in yeast, preventing the formation of both torc1
and torc2 is lethal, and in mice deletion of mtor
results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (hentges et al.,
2001). conditional knockouts of mtor have not yet
been described so it is not clear what the effect of
inhibiting mtor would be in adult mice or in selective
tissues. despite the recent report about the ability of
rapamcyin to inhibit the mtorc2 complex as well as
the mtorc1 complex,
it is not clear that this is a
universal effect in all cells (sarbassov dos et al., 2006).
oncogene
6444
tor and cancer therapy
jb easton and pj houghton
a speciﬁc inhibitor targeting the atp binding domain
of mtor would provide a great deal of information
about the contribution of mtor containing complexes
other than mtorc1 to tumorigenesis as well as cellular
and tissue functions of these complexes, regardless of its
effectiveness as a therapeutic agent.
another potential approach to disrupt mtor signal-
ing would be to block the formation of active mtorc
by creating small molecules that interfere with the
association of mtor complex proteins such as mlst8
or raptor. in theory, by targeting protein partners
that are unique to either mtorc1, or mtorc2, it
would be possible to generate selective tor complex
inhibitors. small molecule inhibitors might also be
developed that block the interaction of the mtor
kinase with substrates containing the tor signaling
motif.
employing rnai to downregulate components of the
mtor pathway that are overexpressed or ampliﬁed
may also be possible. because of delivery considerations,
however, this therapy would currently be restricted to
certain types of cancer.
the determination of the efﬁcacy of inhibiting mtor
in the treatment of various types of cancer is still being
evaluated, and there are many possibilities that have yet
to be explored in identifying areas where rapamycin
might prove to be an effective treatment for cancer.
