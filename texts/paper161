from 8-ohdg mtdna accumulation: a safe and easy
way to meet goals in the sens agenda

abstract
reduction of oxidative stress within mitochondria is a major focus and important part in the
sens agenda. the age-related accumulation of mitochondria rich in oxidatively altered dna
may be a biomarker of malfunctioning and increased oxidative stress. macroautophagy is the
cell repair mechanism responsible for the disposal of excess or altered mitochondria under
the inhibitory control of nutrition and insulin, and may mediate the antiaging effects of caloric
restriction. the authors investigated the effects of stimulation of macroautophagy by the in-
jection of an antilipolytic agent on the age-related accumulation of oxidatively altered mito-
chondrial dna (mtdna) in rat liver cells. results showed that treatment rescued older cells
from the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2ⴕ-deoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in the mtdna in less than
6 hours. it is concluded that the age-related changes in mtdna and function are likely to be
the consequence of a failure of macroautophagy in the recognition and disposal of a small
number of severely injured mitochondria, and that easy and safe ways are available to coun-
teract this change.
introduction
an agenda was proposed quite recently (the
sens  agenda)  to  combat  the  aging  pro-
cess1,2 based  on  repairing  the  molecular  and
cellular  damage  that  accumulates  throughout
life, including rescue of mtdna mutations, so
as  to  prevent  age-related  illness  and  frailty.
however, severe criticism was raised that the
proposed remedies fall in the realm of dreams3
at the present time. therefore, it might be ap-
propriate  to  report  here  very  recent  results
showing that accumulation with increasing age
of mtdna mutations in liver cells can be res-
cued in less than 6 hours by the stimulation of
macroautophagy.
macroautophagy  is  an  important  degrada-
tion/recycling system ubiquitous in eukaryotic
cells  that  involves  the  rearrangement  of  sub-
cellular membranes to sequester cytoplasm and
organelles for delivery to the lysosome, where
the sequestered cargo is degraded and recycled
to generate nutrients during fasting under the
control of amino acids and hormones.4 it is well
known that function of macroautophagy is es-
sential for the turnover and rejuvenation of cel-
lular  components  (including  mitochondria)
and declines with increasing age.5–7
macroautophagy can be induced in liver cells
by  the  injection  of  an  antilipolytic  agent  to
overnight fasted rats.8 treatment causes a highly
reproducible  and  timeable  sequence  of  events:

plasma-free fatty acids, glucose, and insulin lev-
els decrease in less than 10, 15, and 20 minutes,
respectively.9 glucagon  levels  increase  by  20
minutes. vacuolation of liver cell lysosomes and
activation  of  macroautophagy  can  be  detected
with an electron microscope as early as 30 min-
utes after treatment.10 it was shown that the pro-
cess can be monitored easily by measuring the
changes in valine plasma levels.11
materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats were maintained
on a standard rodent chow (harlan teklad,
san pietro al natisone, italy) and given drink-
ing water ad libitum. groups of six rats were
sacrificed by the age of 3 and 16 months after
24 hours of fasting.
acute effects of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole 
(dmp) administration
the antilipolytic agent dmp (12 mg/kg bw)
or  vehicle  only  (physiologic  solution)  was  in-
jected  intraperitoneally  to  older  rats  6  and  3
hours before their sacrifice. the effects of treat-
ment were assessed by assaying free fatty acids
and  glucose  in  plasma  (by  the  acyl  coa  syn-
thetase/oxidase and the glucose oxidase/per-
oxidase  techniques,  respectively,  using  com-
mercially available kits: ffa: free fatty acids
half microtest, boehringer-manheim kk; glu-
cose:  glucinet,  sclavo  isvt,  siena,  italy).9
effects  on  plasma  insulin  were  measured  by 
radioimmunoassay  using  rat  insulin  as  a 
standard.12 the  stimulatory  effect  of  the  an-
tilipolytic drugs on the rate of liver autophagic
proteolysis was monitored by assaying the lev-
els of plasma valine by hplc.13 norvaline was
added  as  an  internal  standard  to  all  samples.
assay of oxidative mtdna damage
the  animals  were  anesthetized  and  livers
were removed and homogenized in ice-cold 0.25
m sucrose solution supplemented with 10 mm
edta (ph 7.2 to 7.4; 1 g wet tissue per 10-ml
solution) by using a potter-elvehjem apparatus
(thomas  scientific,  philadelphia,  pa).  crude
mitochondrial preparations were obtained from
liver homogenates by differential centrifugation.
mtdna was isolated according to the selective
alkaline  denaturation14 modified  procedure,15
and mtdnas (15 to 25 ␮g) were digested to the
deoxynucleoside  level  by  incubation  at  37°c
with 5 u of nuclease p1 (in 20 ␮l of 20 mm so-
dium  acetate,  10  mm  zncl2,  15%  glycerol,  ph
4.8)  for  30  minutes  and  1  u  of  alkaline  phos-

results
the injected antilipolytic agent had a full ef-
fect,  rapidly  lowering  free  fatty  acids  (ffa),
glucose, and insulin plasma levels for almost 3
hours  (fig.  1).  therefore,  drug  was  reinjected
after 3 hours in the following experiment.
table  1  shows  that  treatment  increased  the
plasma  levels  of  valine  through  experimenta-
tion both in younger and 16-month-old rats to
a similar extent.
figure 2 shows the effects of older age and
of  the  antilipolytic  drug  on  8-ohdg  level  in
mtdna. the stimulation of autophagy rescued
liver  cells  from  the  age-associated  accumula-
tion of altered mtdna and tuned levels down
to the juvenile value in less than 6 hours.
discussion
macroautophagy is the universal mechanism
responsible for maintaining and cleaning cells,5
which helps to get rid of altered or excess or-
ganelles and membranes (including mitochon-
dria and peroxisomes).6,18,19 the in vivo func-
tion  of  macroautophagy 
is  regulated  by
nutrition.  (degradation  was  shown  to  occur

with  lack  of  exogenous  nutrients  in  the  inter-
vals  between  meals.)20 it  was  suggested  that
macroautophagy  might  be  involved  in  aging
and  the  antiaging  mechanism  of  caloric  re-
striction.21 several pieces of evidence may sup-
port the hypothesis: increasing deterioration in
functioning of macroautophagy is known to oc-
cur with increasing age starting before age 12
months.7,22 the age-related decline in macroau-
tophagy is counteracted by caloric restriction;23
both extension of lifespan and protection of rat
liver  autophagic  proteolysis  from  the  age-re-
lated decline covary with the duration of anti-
aging  food  restriction  in  a  similar  way;24 life-
long  intermittent  stimulation  of  autophagic
proteolysis by antilipolytic agents leads to the
pharmacologic  intensification  of  suppression
of aging (pisa) by caloric restriction.9,25
it  is  well  known  that  altered  mitochondria
increasing
progressively  accumulate  with 
age,26,27 and accumulation may be part of a vi-
cious circle leading to an increased rate of reac-
tive  oxygen  species  production  and  aging.25,28
caloric restriction can prevent the accumulation
at least in part.29,30 it was proposed that the ben-
eficial effects of caloric restriction decreasing mi-
tochondrial electron flow and proton leaks to at-
tenuate  damage  caused  by  reactive  oxygen
species could depend on an induction of mito-
chondrial biogenesis.31,32
in view of the role of macroautophagy in the
action  mechanism  of  caloric  restriction,  these
data  prompted  the  authors  to  explore  the  ef-
fects of macroautophagy stimulation in altered
mtdna removal. the obtained data, showing
that  two  timed  injections  of  an  antilipolytic
drug  stimulate  autophagy  and  fully  suppress
the  accumulation  of  oxidatively  damaged
mtdna in the aging liver in an astonishingly
short time, indicate that the age-related decline
of  macroautophagic  degradation  may  be  be-
hind  the  age-related  accumulation  in  mam-
malian cells of mitochondria bearing high lev-
els of oxidatively damaged mtdna.
the mitochondrial turnover rate in rat liver
cells is rather slow.33 it is conceivable that the
age-related accumulation of damaged mtdna
might be a consequence of failure of macroau-
tophagy  in  the  selective  disposal  of  a  small
number  of  severely  injured  mitochondria.5 it
has  been  shown  that  incubation  of  primary
cells and cell lines in the absence of serum pro-
motes autophagy of mitochondria with delete-
rious mtdna mutations but spares their nor-
mal counterpart.34
in conclusion, easy and safe ways to meet the
goals of the sens agenda are already available.
the sens agenda also may be a useful guide-
line to focus antiaging biology on the real tar-
gets.
