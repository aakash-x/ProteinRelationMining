atg3 is an e2-like enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of
atg8 and phosphatidylethanolamine (pe). the atg8-pe conju-
gate is essential for autophagy, which is the bulk degradation
process of cytoplasmic components by the vacuolar/lysosomal
system. we report here the crystal structure of saccharomyces
cerevisiae atg3 at 2.5-a˚ resolution. atg3 has an ␣/␤-fold, and its
core region is topologically similar to canonical e2 enzymes.
atg3 has two regions inserted in the core region, one of which
consists of ⬃80 residues and has a random coil structure in solu-
tion and another with a long ␣-helical structure that protrudes
from the core region as far as 30 a˚ . in vivo and in vitro analyses

an e1-like enzyme, and that the latter is responsible for binding

suggesting a possible binding site for the phosphate moiety of
pe. the structure of atg3 provides a molecular basis for under-
standing the unique lipidation reaction that atg3 carries out.
ubiquitin is conjugated to its target proteins by a series of
reactions. initially, the c terminus of ubiquitin is processed
by a specific protease, exposing a glycine residue at the c
terminus. next, the exposed glycine is activated by an e12
enzyme and transferred to an e2 enzyme. finally, ubiquitin is
conjugated to its target proteins by an e3 enzyme (1). many
ubiquitin-like modifiers have been reported, and they all

seem to be conjugated to their targets via a mechanism sim-
ilar to ubiquitination (2).
atg8, a 14-kda protein, is one such ubiquitin-like modifier,
although its target is not a protein but rather a phospholipid,
phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)
(3). despite having little
sequence homology with ubiquitin, atg8 has a similar structure
(4) and is thought to be conjugated to pe by a mechanism sim-
ilar to ubiquitination. specifically, the carboxyl-terminal argi-
nine of atg8 is first processed by atg4, a cysteine protease
structurally related to deubiquitinating enzymes (5, 6). the
exposed glycine residue of atg8 is then activated by atg7, an
e1-like enzyme (7), and then transferred to atg3, an e2-like
enzyme (3). finally, atg8 is conjugated to pe (3).
the formation of the atg8-pe conjugate is essential for
autophagy, the bulk degradation process of cytosolic compo-
nents by the vacuolar/lysosomal system (8). although auto-
phagy was originally identified as a response to starvation,
recent studies show that it plays a critical role in many bio-
logical processes such as neurodegeneration, infection, and
cellular survival during neonatal starvation (9–13). in vitro
reconstitution studies revealed that atg3, atg7, atg8, atp, and
pe-containing membranes are necessary and sufficient for the
conjugation of atg8 with pe (14). although most e2 enzymes
require e3 enzymes, atg3 by itself is catalytically competent for
atg8-pe formation.
we report here the crystal structure of atg3 at 2.5-å resolu-
tion. the core of atg3 is topologically similar to canonical e2
enzymes. in addition to the core region, atg3 has two charac-
teristic insertions, both of which are essential for the function of
atg3 in vitro and in vivo. these results provide important infor-
mation for understanding the unique lipidation reaction medi-
ated by atg3.
experimental procedures
protein expression and purification—wild-type atg3 was
expressed and purified for crystallization as described previ-
ously (15). for in vitro assays, wild-type atg3 and three atg3
mutants (atg3⌬fr, atg3fr, and atg3⌬hr) were prepared as
follows. the regions encoding amino acids 1–310 (wild-type),
1–82 and 163–310 (atg3⌬fr), 1–245 and 281–310
(atg3⌬hr), and 84–161 (atg3fr) of atg3 were inserted into
pgex-6p-1 (ge healthcare) and were expressed in escherichia
coli strain bl21 (de3) cells. the cells were lysed, and glutathi-

one s-transferase (gst)-fused atg3s were purified by affinity
chromatography using a glutathione-sepharose 4b column (ge
healthcare). for in vitro pulldown assays, gst-fused atg3s
were further purified using a resource q anion-exchange col-
umn (ge healthcare) followed by a superdex 200 gel filtration
column (ge healthcare) without excision of gst. for in vitro
conjugation assays, gst was excised from gst-fused atg3
with prescission protease (ge healthcare), and the excised
gst and prescission protease were removed from atg3 by
repurification on a glutathione-sepharose 4b column. atg7 and
a processed form of atg8 used for in vitro conjugation and
pulldown assays were prepared as follows. the region coding
1–630 of atg7 was inserted into pgex-6p-1 and expressed in
e. coli bl21 cells. after cell lysis, gst-fused atg7 was purified
by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-sepharose 4b
column, and gst was excised from atg7 with prescission pro-
tease. atg7 was further purified by a resource q column fol-
lowed by a superdex 200 column. the region encoding amino
acids 1–116 of atg8 was inserted into pgex-6p-1 and was
expressed in e. coli bl21 cells. after cell lysis, gst-fused atg8
was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-
sepharose 4b column, and gst was excised from atg8 with
prescission protease. atg8 was further purified by a resource s
cation-exchange column (ge healthcare) followed by a super-
dex 75 gel filtration column (ge healthcare). all constructs
were sequenced to confirm their identities.
preparation of derivative crystals and data collection—
crystallization of atg3 was carried out as described previously
(15). platinum and two mercury derivatives were prepared by
soaking the crystals of atg3 for 30 min in a solution of 1.8 m
lithium sulfate and 0.1 m citrate buffer (ph 6.6) containing 10
mm k2ptcl4, 1 mm hgcl2, or 0.1 mm thimerosal. the seleno-
methionine derivative was expressed in e. coli b834 (de3)
using an amino acid medium containing selenomethionine
instead of methionine, and it was crystallized under the same
conditions used for native crystals. derivative crystals were
immersed in a reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glyc-
erol for several seconds, flash-cooled, and kept in a stream of
nitrogen gas at 100 k during data collection. diffraction data for
the native crystal was collected on the adsc quantum 315
charge-coupled device detector at beamline bl41xu, spring-8
(japan) at a wavelength of 1.00 å. diffraction data for deriva-
tives were collected on rigaku r-axis iv or vii imaging plate
detectors using copper k␣radiation from an in-house rigaku
rotating anode x-ray generator. diffraction data were processed
with the hkl2000 program (16). the statistics for the diffrac-
tion data are summarized in table 1.
structure determination and refinement—the structure
of atg3 was determined by the multiple isomorphous
replacement method. heavy atom sites were found and
refined, and the initial phases were calculated using the pro-
gram solve and resolve (17). approximately 40% of the
residues were automatically modeled as a polyalanine chain
by resolve. further model construction was performed
manually using the molecular modeling program turbo-
frodo (18), and the refinement was performed using the
cns program (19). the refinement statistics are summa-
rized in table 1. the coordinates and structure factors of
atg3 have been deposited in the protein data bank (pdb
code 2dyt).
nmr spectroscopy—proteins uniformly labeled with 15n
were prepared by growing bacteria in m9 medium containing 1
g/liter 15nh4cl (shoko). the purified atg3fr and full-length
atg3 were concentrated to 0.5 mm in 92% h2o/8% d2o con-

dithiothreitol. 1h-15n heteronuclear single quantum correla-
tion (hsqc) spectra were obtained with varian unity
inova 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe.
spectra were processed by nmrpipe (20), and data analysis was
carried out using the sparky program (21).
in vitro pulldown assay—the purified gst-fused atg3
mutants and gst (control) (0.5 nmol) were mixed with purified
atg7 or atg8 (0.5 nmol) in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
incubated at 277 k for 1 h. next, glutathione-sepharose 4b
slurry was added, and the mixture was further incubated at 277
k for 1 h. after washing the beads three times with pbs, pro-
teins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer (ph 8.0). the eluates were subjected to sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyaclylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and
the proteins were detected by staining with coomassie brilliant
blue (cbb).
in vitro conjugation assay—in vitro conjugation was per-
formed according to the previous report (14). liposomes were
prepared as follows. all phospholipids were purchased from
avanti polar lipids. dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine,
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphoshatidylcholine, and dioleoylphospha-
tidic acid were mixed in a glass tube at the ratio of 7:1:2 in
chloroform. the chloroform solvent was removed by rotary
evaporation. samples were dried further in a desiccator under
vacuum for 12 h. the resulting lipid film was suspended in a
buffer (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 137 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl) at a
final concentration of 1 mm phospholipid by mixing vigorously.
samples were then subjected to sonication for 5 min to obtain
small unilamellar liposomes. atg3 mutants (10 ␮m) were mixed
with 10 ␮m atg7, 50 ␮m carboxyl-terminal glycine-exposed
form of atg8, and liposomes in reconstitution buffer (50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 100 mm nacl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm
mgcl2, and 1 mm atp). the reaction mixture was incubated at
303 k for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by mixing with
sds-page sample buffer and boiling. samples were separated
by urea-sds-page (5), and proteins were identified by staining
with cbb.
assay of atg3 activity in vivo—yeast cells (mat␣ura3 leu2
his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ⌬atg3::trp1) expressing wild-type atg3 or
atg3 mutants from a multicopy plasmid (prs425) were grown
to an a600 of ⬃1.0 and then starved by placing them in s.d.
(⫺n) medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids
and ammonium sulfate and with 2% glucose) for 4.5 h. cells (5
a600 units) were collected by centrifugation and suspended in
1 ml of a solution containing 0.2 m naoh and 0.5% 2-mer-
captoethanol, incubated for 10 min on ice, and mixed with
120 ␮l of 100% trichloroacetic acid. after centrifugation, the
pellets were resuspended in sds-page sample buffer and
boiled. lysates were separated by sds-page and analyzed
by immunoblotting.
results
overall structure of atg3—the crystal structure of atg3
was refined against 2.5 å data to an r-factor of 0.207 and a
free r-factor of 0.244. the region corresponding to amino
acids 21–306 was modeled along with two sulfate and 46
water molecules. the 20 amino-terminal and 4 carboxyl-
terminal residues as well as three regions corresponding to
residues 84–128, 143–162, and 271–278 lacked defined elec-
tron density and were omitted from the model (fig. 1a). the
overall structure of atg3 has a unique hammer-like shape
consisting of a head and a handle. the head moiety is com-
posed of a central six-stranded ␤-sheet (strands 1–6) with
five ␣-helices (a, b, d, e, g) surrounding it, and it has a
globular-fold with approximate dimensions of 45 ⫻ 40 ⫻ 35
å. the handle moiety is composed of a long ␣-helix (f) and a
partially disordered loop region, and it protrudes from the
head moiety as far as 30 å. at the interface between the head
and handle moieties, atg3 has a “floating” helix c in which
the amino and carboxyl termini are disordered and not con-
nected to the other regions of atg3 in the model.
structural comparison with canonical e2s—although atg3
is thought to be an e2-like enzyme based on its function, it has
little sequence homology with canonical e2 enzymes, so it is not
clear whether atg3 has structural similarity with them. for
comparison, the structure of ubc9, an e2 enzyme for small
ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo), is shown in the same orienta-
tion as atg3 (fig. 1b) (22). although the structure of atg3
seems to be significantly different from that of ubc9, structural
comparison using the dali search engine revealed that the
topology of the head moiety of atg3 is very similar to canonical
e2 enzymes including ubc9. all e2 enzymes reported so far
have a conserved e2 core composed of a central four-stranded
␤-sheet and four ␣-helices surrounding it (fig. 1b, right) (22,
23). the head moiety of atg3 has the corresponding four
␤-strands (1–4) and two ␣-helices (b and g) but lacks two car-
boxyl-terminal ␣-helices (fig. 1b, left). intriguingly, ubiquitin
e2 variant domains, which have a canonical e2 core-fold but do
not have e2 activities, also lack these two carboxyl-terminal
␣-helices (24). although ubc9 has only four strands, it has a
short ␤-hairpin-like loop that topologically corresponds to
strands 5 and 6 of atg3 (fig. 1b).
the catalytic site structure of atg3—although more second-
ary structures are inserted at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal
sides of atg3 cys-234 compared with ubc9 cys-93, both cata-
lytic cysteines are located at the carboxyl terminus of the
␤-sheet (strand 5 and 6) or the similarly located ␤-hairpin-like
structure (fig. 1b). fig. 1c shows the detailed structure around
the catalytic cysteine of atg3 (left) and ubc9 (right). the cata-
lytic cysteine of ubc9, cys-93, is located at the carboxyl termi-
nus of the hairpin-like loop and forms a hydrogen bond with
asn-85 at the amino terminus of the same hairpin. thus, the
side chains of cys-93 and asn-85 are in close proximity. asn-85
of ubc9 is conserved among all canonical e2s and is essential
for the conjugation reaction because it functions as an oxyanion
hole. cys-234 of atg3 is located at the carboxyl terminus of
strand 6 in a similar fashion as cys-93 of ubc9, but there is no
residue corresponding to asn-85 of ubc9 at the amino termi-
nus of strand 5. furthermore, pro-233 forms a hydrogen bond
with val-239 on helix f, so that the side chain of cys-234 faces
helix f but not strand 5. as a result, the side chain of cys-234 is
surrounded by the side chains of gln-27 at the loop between
helices a and b and asn-238 at the amino terminus of the helix
f, neither of which are conserved among atg3 homologs (fig.

2). further studies are required to identify the residue of atg3
that functions like asn-85 of ubc9 as an oxyanion hole.
two unique inserted regions in atg3—as mentioned above,
the handle moiety, which consists of a long ␣-helix f and a loop,
is a structural feature unique to atg3. we named this the handle
region (hr). fig. 2 shows a sequence alignment of three atg3
homologs. the sequence of human ubc9 is also aligned based
on the crystal structures. the amino-terminal half of helix f is
conserved among atg3 homologs, but its carboxyl-terminal
half and downstream loop region are not conserved. the long
helical structure of the hr seems to be unique to yeast atg3. in
addition to the hr, atg3 has a second unique inserted region, a
long inserted region between strands 2 and 3 that is present in
all three atg3 homologs. although the sequence identity of this
region is low among the atg3 homologs, its length (80–100
residues) and highly acidic character (calculated pi ⫽ 3.6–3.7)
are conserved. in the crystal, this region of yeast atg3 takes a
flexible conformation, and most residues are not modeled
because of their poor electron density. the conformation of
residues 129–142, which are modeled as helix c, also seems to
be flexible because the average b-factor of these residues is
rather high (89.9 and 54.0 å2 for helix c and all atg3 residues,
respectively). helix c forms weak interactions with three heli-
ces (b, f, g), which may partially stabilize its conformation in
the crystal. we named the inserted region between strands 2
and 3 the flexible region (fr).
fr has a random coil structure in solution—because most
residues of fr are disordered in the crystal, we could not obtain
further structural information on fr from the crystal structure.
to obtain structural
information on fr in solution, we
expressed the fr moiety of atg3 (83–162) in e. coli, purified it,
and analyzed it by nmr spectroscopy. fig. 3a shows the
1h-15n hsqc spectrum of the fr moiety of atg3. the pattern
of the spectrum indicates a random coil structure and does not
contain any signs of secondary structures. we also measured
the hsqc spectrum of full-length atg3 (fig. 3b). intriguingly,
the spectrum of full-length atg3 was strikingly similar to that of
fr, suggesting that most observed signals for full-length atg3
were derived from the fr moiety. this observation indicates
that the mobility of fr is much higher than that of other regions
of atg3 because the residues located at the flexible regions give
strong nmr signals because of long t2 relaxation times com-
pared with those located at the rigid regions. these results sug-
gest that the fr moiety of atg3 has a random coil structure and

is highly mobile in solution, not only in the isolated state but
also in intact atg3. although residues 129–142 of fr have a
helical structure in the crystal (fig. 1, a and b), they may have a
more flexible conformation in solution.
conjugation activity of atg3 mutants—to identify the roles
of fr and hr in atg3 in the atg8-pe conjugation system, we
generated mutants lacking fr (⌬fr) and hr (⌬hr). these pro-
teins were expressed in e. coli, purified, and used for in vitro
conjugation assays. because the amino-terminal conserved res-
idues (239–245) of hr form hydrophobic interactions with the
core region of atg3, they are included in the ⌬hr construct to
avoid destroying the overall fold of atg3. wild-type, ⌬fr, and
⌬hr mutants of atg3 were incubated fo r 1 h at 303 kwith atg7,
atp, and pe-containing liposomes, separated by urea-sds-
page, and stained with cbb (fig. 4a). compared with wild-
type atg3, the conjugation activity of the atg3⌬hr mutant was
moderately reduced, and that of atg3⌬fr was greatly reduced.
we next analyzed the conjugation activity of these mutants
in vivo. similar levels of wild-type, ⌬hr, and ⌬fr atg3s were
expressed in ⌬atg3 yeast strains (fig. 4b). cell extracts were
separated by urea-sds-page, and atg8 was visualized by
immunoblotting with an anti-atg8 antibody (fig. 4c).
atg3⌬hr had a moderate ability to mediate atg8-pe conjuga-
tion, whereas atg3⌬fr completely lacked the ability to mediate
atg8-pe formation. these results agree well with the in vitro
results (fig. 4a).
finally, we examined the autophagy activity of these atg3
mutants by monitoring the maturation of the proform of ape1,
which was transported into vacuoles via the cytoplasm-to-vac-
uole targeting pathway under nutrient-rich conditions or by

figure 4. in vitro and in vivo conjugation and autophagy activities of
atg3 mutants. a, conjugation activity of atg3 mutants in vitro. wild-type
atg3, atg3⌬fr, or atg3⌬hr was mixed with atg7, atg8, atp, and pe-contain-
ing liposomes and incubated at 303 k for 1 h. the reaction solutions were
separated by urea-sds-page and stained with cbb. b–d, activity of atg3
mutants in yeast. total lysates of starved ⌬atg3 cells expressing wild-type
atg3, atg3⌬fr, or atg3⌬hr from prs425 were prepared and separated by
sds-page. b, amount of atg3 expressed in yeast. atg3 mutants were
expressed at similar levels as wild-type atg3. atg3 was recognized by immu-
noblotting with an anti-atg3 antibody. c, formation of atg8-pe in starved
cells. formation of atg8-pe was lost in the atg3⌬fr mutant and decreased in
the atg3⌬hr mutant. atg8 was recognized by immunoblotting with an anti-
atg8 antibody. d, ape1 maturation mediated by autophagy. autophagy was
abolished in cells expressing the atg3⌬fr mutant, and it was severely
impaired in cells expressing atg3⌬hr. ape1 was recognized by immunoblot-
ting with an anti-ape1 antibody.
autophagy under condition of nutrient starvation. the protein
is then processed into a mature form within the vacuoles. cells
expressing atg3⌬hr showed a moderate level of ape1 matura-
tion, whereas ape1 was not processed to the mature form in
cells expressing atg3⌬fr (fig. 4d). these results suggest that
hr is partly necessary and that fr is crucial for the function of
atg3 in autophagy.
identification of binding partners for hr and fr—our in
vitro and in vivo analyses showed that hr and fr of atg3 play
some roles in the formation of atg8-pe. we next performed an
in vitro pulldown assay to determine whether hr and fr of
atg3 are responsible for the recognition of atg7 and atg8.
wild-type atg3, atg3⌬hr, atg3⌬fr, and atg3fr fused to gst
were mixed with either atg7 or atg8 and then applied to gluta-
thione-sepharose resin. as expected, wild-type atg3 bound to
both atg7 and atg8 (fig. 5, a and b). atg3⌬hr also bound to
atg7, indicating that hr is not necessary for atg7 binding. in
contrast, atg3⌬fr could not bind atg7. interestingly, atg3fr
bound to atg7 as strongly as wild-type atg3. these results indi-
cate that fr of atg3 is necessary and sufficient for atg7 binding.
on the other hand, atg3⌬fr bound to atg8 as strongly as wild-
type atg3, whereas atg3⌬hr bound only weakly to atg8. this
indicates that hr of atg3 mediates the binding of atg8.
discussion
in the current study, we showed that, despite having little
sequence homology, atg3 and canonical e2 enzymes have sim-
ilar structures. there are four classes of e2 enzymes (i–iv).
class i consists of the conserved e2 core and lacks large exten-
sions (25), whereas classes ii and iii have carboxyl- and amino-
terminal extensions, respectively (26, 27), and class iv has both
figure 5. identification of binding partners for fr and hr of atg3. a, in

gst-fused atg3 (wild-type, ⌬fr, ⌬hr, or fr) and then incubated with gluta-
thione-sepharose 4b. after washing with pbs, proteins were eluted, sepa-
rated by 8% sds-page, and stained with cbb. b, in vitro pulldown assay using

ing with pbs, proteins were eluted, separated by 15% sds-page, and stained

extensions in addition to the e2 core (28). although atg3 is
topologically similar to the canonical e2 core region, the struc-
tural difference is too large to place it in any of the four classes.
atg3 lacks two carboxyl-terminal ␣-helices that are absolutely
conserved among known e2 enzymes. furthermore, atg3 has
two large insertions, fr and hr, in the core region. in vitro and
in vivo analyses showed that these two insertions play critical
roles in the atg8-pe conjugation reaction (fig. 4), and an in
vitro pulldown assay suggested that fr and hr are responsible
for atg7 and atg8 binding, respectively (fig. 5).
recently, the structure of ubc12 in complex with the carbox-
yl-terminal ubiquitin-like (ubl) domain of uba3, a subunit of
the e1 for nedd8, was reported (29). fig. 6a shows the struc-
tures of atg3, and fig. 6b a complex of ubc12 bound to the ubl
domain, in the same orientation. the amino-terminal helix of
ubc12, which corresponds to helix b of atg3, is bound to the
hydrophobic patch on the ubl domain of uba3 in a similar
manner as ubiquitin-binding modules (fig. 6b). the carboxyl-
terminal ubl domain is conserved in e1 enzymes for ubiquitin,
sumo, and nedd8. such a ubl domain is not found in the
sequence for atg7, an e1-like enzyme for atg8. furthermore, in
vitro pulldown assays showed that fr of atg3 mediated the
binding of atg7. the insertion sites of fr and helix b are located
on the opposite sides of atg3 (fig. 6a). taken together, these
results suggest that the atg7-atg3 interaction is different from
the e1–e2 interaction observed in other conjugation systems.
intriguingly, our nmr studies showed that fr has a random
coil structure in solution. it is possible that atg7 induces con-
formational changes in fr via a specific interaction. structural
studies on the atg7 and atg7䡠atg3 complex should resolve
these issues.

figure 6. structural comparison of atg3 with canonical e2s bound to their targets. a, ribbon diagram of atg3. color coding is as described in the legend
to fig. 1b. the side chain of cys-234 and a sulfate ion observed near cys-234 are shown with stick models. b, ribbon diagram of ubc12 bound to the ubl domain
of uba3, a subunit of the e1 for nedd8 (protein data bank code 1y8x). conserved ␣-helices and ␤-strands in atg3 and ubc12 are colored red and cyan,
respectively. the side chain of cys-111 is shown with a stick model. c, ribbon diagram of sumo-rangap1 conjugate bound to ubc9 (protein data bank code
1z5s). although nup358, an e3 enzyme, is also bound to this complex, the protein is not shown in this figure. gly-97 of sumo and the side chains of ubc9 cys-93
and rangap1 lys-524 are shown with stick models. the figure was prepared using pymol. conserved ␣-helices and ␤-strands in atg3 and ubc9 are colored red
and cyan, respectively.
recently, the structure of ubc9 bound to the sumo-ran-
gap1 conjugate was reported (fig. 6c) (30). in this structure,
sumo is bound to the second helix of ubc9, which corre-
sponds to helix g of atg3. the structure of ubc1 bound to
ubiquitin was also reported, in which ubiquitin is bound simi-
larly to the second helix of ubc1 (31). these two structures
suggest that the second helix of canonical e2s is the conserved
binding site for modifier proteins. hr of atg3 is inserted at the
amino terminus of helix g and occupies a similar location as the
sumo/ubiquitin site in ubc9/ubc1 (fig. 6, a and c). notably,
an in vitro pulldown assay showed that atg8 binds to hr. a
sulfate ion derived from the crystallization reservoir solution
binds in the groove near cys-234 (figs. 1c and 6a). this sulfate
ion and hr are located on the opposite sides of cys-234, just as
rangap1 and sumo are located on the opposite sides of ubc9
cys-93 (fig. 6, a and c). anions often mimic phosphate groups,
and in the case of pe-binding protein, acetate and cacodylate
ions were observed at the binding site of the phosphate moiety
of pe (32, 33). accordingly, the sulfate ion observed in the atg3
crystal may also mimic the phosphate group of pe and bind to
the pe-binding site. three basic residues (lys-183, his-232,
lys-235), which surround the sulfate ion, might recognize the
phosphate moiety of pe. however, the recognition of pe by
atg3 seems to be more complex because pe is incorporated into
membranes in vivo.
although atg8-pe conjugation does not require e3 enzymes
in vitro, the atg12-atg5 conjugate, the other conjugate required
for autophagy, is crucial for atg8-pe conjugation in vivo (34).
however, the molecular details of this reaction remain unknown.
atg8-pe conjugation is the only lipidation reaction known to be
mediated by a ubiquitin-like modification system. because pe
does not exist alone in solution but is instead incorporated into
membranes, recognition of pe as a target for conjugation is
expected to require specific machinery not utilized by canoni-
cal protein-protein conjugation systems. therefore, the role of
the atg12-atg5 conjugate in the atg8-pe conjugation reaction
must be elucidated.
