p73 regulates dram-independent autophagy that does
not contribute to programmed cell death
d crighton1, j o’prey1, hs bell1,2 and km ryan*,1
evading programmed cell death is a common event in tumour development. the p53 family member, p73, is a potent inducer of
death and a determinant of chemotherapeutic response, but different to p53, is rarely mutated in cancer. understanding cell
death pathways downstream of p53 and p73 is therefore pivotal to understand both the development and treatment of malignant
disease. recently, p53 has been shown to modulate autophagy – a membrane trafﬁcking process, which degrades long-lived
proteins and organelles. this requires a p53 target gene, dram, and both dram and autophagy are critical for p53-mediated
death. we report here that ta-p73 also regulates dram and autophagy, with different ta-p73 isoforms regulating dram and
autophagy to varying extents. rnai knockdown of dram, however, revealed that p73’s modulation of autophagy is dram-
independent. also, p73’s ability to induce death, again different to p53, is neither dependent on dram nor autophagy. in contrast
to ta-p73, dn-p73 is a negative regulator of p53-induced and p73-induced autophagy, but does not affect autophagy induced by
amino-acid starvation. these studies, therefore, represent not only the ﬁrst report that p73 modulates autophagy but also
highlight important differences in the mechanism by which starvation, p53 and p73 regulate autophagy and how this contributes
to programmed cell death.

in higher eukaryotes, programmed cell death pathways
represent a major protective mechanism against malignant
disease.1 these pathways are stimulated when cells experi-
ence adverse conditions to prevent
the propagation of
mutated or damaged cells that may otherwise go on to form
a tumour. as a result, inactivation of cell death pathways is a
common event in many types of cancer.2 many standard
forms of chemotherapy also utilize programmed cell death
pathways to invoke a therapeutic response.3 as a result, the
inactivation of these pathways during tumour development
poses a serious problem for clinical success. however, the
mechanism by which cell death is regulated during tumour
development and in cancer therapy remains unclear. the
further investigation, therefore, of the factors and pathways
controlling tumour cell death should lead not only to a better
understanding of the aetiology of cancer but also to improved
strategies and novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
one of the major factors controlling tumour cell death is the
tumour suppressor p53.4 the importance of cell death to
tumour suppression is exempliﬁed by p53, which is mutated in
50% of all human cancers.5 in response to various forms of
cellular stress, including dna damage, hypoxia and onco-
gene activation, p53 levels become elevated.4 after a small
proportion of p53 localizes to mitochondria – to stimulate cell
death by interaction with members of the bcl-2 family6–8 – the
majority of p53 accumulates in the nucleus where it activates a
number of target genes.1,4 these genes regulate a spectrum
of biological processes, for example growth arrest and dna
repair, but an ever increasing number invoke cell death
through a variety of mechanisms to ultimately stimulate the
apoptotic cascade.1,4,9,10
p53 has recently also been linked to another cellular
process that controls cell death – autophagy.11,12 autophagy
(strictly the form of autophagy known as macroautophagy, but
hereafter for simplicity referred to as autophagy) is a vesicular
trafﬁcking process that mediates the degradation of long-lived
proteins and is the only pathway within the cell
for the
degradation of organelles.13 the basal levels of autophagy in
a cell can vary from cell type to cell type, but can be stimulated
in response to various forms of stress. upon induction, a
membrane structure known as the ‘isolation membrane’
is
formed de novo from an unknown origin. this structure grows
to form a double-membraned vesicle containing bulk cyto-
plasm and organelles – the autophagosome. these autopha-
gosomes then mature, perhaps fusing with endosomes,
before fusing with lysosomes. the acidic hydrolases of the
lysosome then effect degradation of
the
autophagosome, resulting in amino acids and fatty acids that
can then be either metabolized for energy production or
recycled into biosynthetic pathways.14
the contents of
autophagy has been reported to have both roles in cell
death and cell survival.15 in response to nutrient deprivation,
for example, the induction of autophagy can act as a self-
limited survival mechanism, by degrading bulk cytoplasm and

organelles for energy production until a sufﬁcient supply of
exogenous nutrients is restored.16–18 in other situations,
however, autophagy has been reported to be a pro-death
mechanism either by inducing type ii ‘autophagic cell death’ or
by linking with other cell death pathways, including apoptosis,
to effect the demise of the cell.19,20 in tumour development,
therefore, autophagy can be considered, depending on the
context, to act in either an oncogenic or tumour suppressive
capacity. p53 has been reported to be an inducer of
autophagy.11,12 morever, the recent discovery that dram –
a p53 target gene that is required for p53-induced autophagy –
is frequently down-regulated in squamous cancers under-
scores the notion that autophagy is a component of tumour
suppression downstream of p53.12
p73 is a protein that is closely related to p53.21,22 it shares
many functional similarities with p53, for example, both have
been reported to mediate cell cycle arrest and programmed
cell death.23 clearly though,
the two proteins also have
functions. this is perhaps most exempliﬁed in
divergent
studies of mouse development in which p53 appears largely
dispensable, whereas p73-null animals exhibit clear develop-
mental abnormalities.24,25 in addition, during tumour devel-
opment, in contrast to p53, p73 is rarely mutated, indicating
different contributions of the two proteins to tumour suppres-
sion.26 several studies have shown that that these differences
may lie in the spectrum of target genes activated by p53 and
p73 in speciﬁc contexts and how these integrate to determine
a cell’s fate.27 we sought therefore to determine whether p73,
like p53, can regulate dram and autophagy and whether this
contributes to p73-mediated programmed cell death.
results
p73 is an inducer of autophagy. to investigate if p73
modulates autophagy, we utilized previously characterized
tetracycline-responsive (teton) cell
lines for three of the
transactivation-competent (ta) isoforms of p73: ta-p73a,
ta-p73b and ta-p73g.28 upon treatment of these cells with
the tetracycline analogue, doxycycline (dox) each line
undergoes a marked induction in expression of
the
transgene (figure 1a). before induction each of the lines,
as well as a p53 inducible line (teton-p53), were infected
with an adenovirus expressing the autophagy marker gfp-
lc3.29 in most unstimulated cells, endogenous lc3 exists in
a form lc3i, which shows a diffuse distribution within the
cytoplasm. when autophagy is induced, lc3i is lipidated to
form lc3ii which integrates into the autophagosome

membrane.30 when this occurs, the exogenous marker gfp-
lc3 behaves similarly and can be easily observed as distinct
puncta under ﬂuorescent microscopy.29 although only a few
gfp-lc3 puncta could be observed in each of the lines in
the absence of dox, a large number of puncta were clearly
visible following induction of each of the splice variants of
p73 (figure 1b). no increase in puncta was observed when
parental saos2 cells were treated with dox (supplementary
figure 1). ta-p73g had the strongest effect, with
approximately 50% of
transgene-positive cells having a
signiﬁcant number of gfp-lc3 puncta (above 8 per cell) –
a score similar to what is observed following p53 induction
(figure 1c). ta-p73a and ta-p73b had a less potent effect
on autophagy with approximately 20–30% of the p73-postive
cells showing signiﬁcant levels of gfp-lc3 puncta – despite
similar levels of transgene expression to ta-p73g following
treatment with dox (figure 1a and c).
next, we analysed cells for the appearance of autophago-
somes by electron microscopy (em). morphologically, auto-
phagosomes are double-membraned vesicles that contain
cytoplasm and/or organelles. these are most obvious in the
later stages of autophagy when the autophagosomes contain
at least partially degraded material and appear more electron
dense.14 consistent with our ﬁndings with gfp-lc3, treat-
ment of teton-p73g cells with dox caused a marked induction
of electron dense vesicles (figure 1d, middle panel). when
these vesicles were examined under higher magniﬁcation,
they were clearly double-membraned and contained cellular
material (figure 1d, right panel).
the autophagosome is a transient mid-point
in the
autophagy process. as such, accumulation of autophaga-
somes in cells can either indicate induction of autophagy or a
blockade in the turnover of autophagosomes. as autophagy is
the major route by which long-lived proteins are degraded
in cells, we monitored the degradation rate of these proteins
in the absence or presence of p73. teton-p73g cells were
radio-labelled with [35s]met/cys and treated with dox or
cultured in the absence of amino acids (a known inducer of
autophagy).13 starvation and p73 expression both caused
comparable increases in the degradation of
long-lived
proteins,
indicating that p73 is an inducer of autophagy
(figure 1e).
lastly, we sought to determine whether endogenous p73
could modulate autophagy. to do this, we utilized saos2 cells,
which are null for p53 but have been shown to induce p73
following treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug etopo-
side.31 to determine the contribution of endogenous p73,
these cells were infected with either a scrambled shrna or a
previously described shrna designed to knockdown p73.32 in
line with our ﬁndings with exogenous p73, the subsequent
infection of these cells with gfp-lc3 and treatment with
etoposide revealed a marked induction in the appearance of
autophagosomes that was greatly reduced in cells expressing
the shrna targeting p73 (figure 1f).

following induction of the p73 isoforms and p53 for 24 h,
rna was isolated and the levels of dram determined by
quantitative rt-pcr (qpcr). this revealed that although
ta-p73g was a strong inducer of dram expression
(fourfold), ta-p73a and -b induced only small, but
reproducible increases in dram mrna (figure 2a). each
of the lines, however, was able to activate signiﬁcant levels of
p21 (figure 2b). this therefore indicates that the low level of
dram activation by ta-p73a and -b is genuine and not due
to a lack of functional competence for these splice variants.
to determine if the effect of p73 on dram was direct, we
generated a h1299 cell
line from a
carcinoma of the lung), which contains a p73–er fusion
protein. this switchable system can be used to modulate
the activity of p73 by addition of the oestrogen analogue,
tamoxifen (tam).33 activation of p73–er with tam does not
require protein synthesis and as a result changes in mrna
expression, which occur in the presence of a protein synthesis
inhibitor, such as cycloheximide (chx), can be considered
direct. in this system, dram was markedly induced following
treatment with tam either in the absence or presence of chx
(figure 2c) demonstrating a direct effect of p73 on dram
expression.
line (a p53-null cell
to further examine the direct nature of the ability of p73 to
activate dram, we examined if p73 could activate a luciferase
reporter construct containing a fragment of dram intron 1,
which has previously been shown to be p53 responsive.12
consistent with our observations of dram activation in
teton-p73g cells (figure 2a), co-transfection of ta-p73g with
this reporter caused an approximately sixfold increase in
luciferase activity (figure 2d). however, also consistent with
our analysis of activation of endogenous dram (figure 2a),
this was considerably lower
than the 12-fold induction
observed following transfection of p53 (figure 2d).
as the ability of the p73 isoforms to induce autophagosome
accumulation correlated with the ability to induce dram,
we next asked if dram induction was required for p73 to
modulate autophagy. initially, we focused our analysis on
ta-p73g owing to its pronounced effects on autophagy and
dram. teton-p73g cells were transfected with three dram-
speciﬁc sirnas and a non-targeting sirna control. each of
these dram sirnas caused a marked reduction in both basal
dram and the levels of dram seen following treatment with
dox (figure 3a). to test the effects of dram knockdown on
autophagy in whole populations of p73-expressing cells, we
utilized the fact that, as well as being detectable as puncta
by immunoﬂuorescence, lc3ii migrates faster than lc3i on
sds-page gels.29,30 teton-p73g cells were transfected with
dram-speciﬁc and non-targeting sirnas and subsequently
infected with gfp-lc3. cell lysates were analysed 48 h later
by western blotting to determine the ratio of gfp-lc3i/gfp-
lc3ii (figure 3b). for comparison, we assayed one of the
dram-speciﬁc sirnas for its ability to knockdown dram and
to affect the ratio of lc3i/lc3ii in teton-p53 cells (figure 3c
and d). taken together, these data revealed that, in contrast to
what was observed in teton-p53 cells where a clear reduction
in gfp-lc3ii was observed (figure 3d), knockdown of dram
had no affect on the gfp-lc3i/gfp-lc3ii ratio in teton-p73g
cells (figure 3b). this indicates that p73-mediated modulation
of autophagy is dram independent.

p73-mediated induction of dram is not required for
programmed cell death. our previous studies had also
observed that as well as being required for p53 to induce
autophagy, dram was also required for p53-mediated
programmed cell death.12 we ﬁrst therefore questioned if
the ability of p73 isoforms to induce programmed cell death
correlated with expression of dram. teton-p73a, -b and -g
cells were treated with dox for 48 h and the extent of resulting
apoptosis measured by ﬂow cytometry. different to what we
observed for activation of dram by the p73 isoforms, where
activation was most pronounced following induction by ta-
p73g, we found that levels of cell death were comparable
following activation of ta-p73b and -g (figure 4a).
in
contrast, only a small amount of apoptosis was seen
following activation of p73a (figure 4a).
we next sought to determine therefore whether dram
was contributing to the cell death observed. teton-ta-p73g
cells were transfected with the three dram-speciﬁc
sirnas and a non-targeting sirna control as outlined in
figure 3a. for comparison, analysis was also made of
the effects of dram knockdown in teton-p53 cells
(figure 4b). cells were then incubated in either the absence
or presence of dox and the extent of cell death determined by
ﬂow cytometry. none of the dram-speciﬁc sirnas caused
any signiﬁcant effect on the cell death seen following
activation of ta-p73g (figure 4c); however, consistent with
our previous studies, dram knockdown caused a reduction in
the amount of cell death observed following activation of p53
(figure 4d).
induction of autophagy by p73 does not contribute to
programmed cell death. our data indicate that in contrast to
p53, when dram is induced by p73, it does not appear to play
a role in either p73’s modulation of autophagy or programmed
cell death. this however does not rule-out the possibility that
p73-induced autophagy is contributing to cell death in a dram-
independent manner. to test this, we transfected teton-ta-
p73g and teton-p53 cells with a previously described sirna
targeting the essential autophagy gene atg512 and a non-
targeting control. following atg5 silencing, which was
conﬁrmed by qpcr (figure 5a and b), the ability of p53 and
p73g to modulate autophagy, as determined by analysis of
lc3i/lc3ii ratios by western blotting, was markedly reduced
(figure 5c and d). we next analysed if atg5 knockdown in
these cells affected programmed cell death. consistent with
our previous studies, atg5 knockdown caused a statistically
signiﬁcant (p¼ 0.008) decrease in amount of cell death seen
from p53 when compared with cells transfected with non-
targeting sirna control (figure 5c).12 in contrast, no reduction
in cell death was observed following atg5 knockdown in ta-
p73g cells (figure 5d). a small but reproducible increase in
death was observed, however,
found to be
statistically signiﬁcant (p40.05). these data clearly indicate
that, in contrast to p53, the modulation of autophagy by ta-
p73g does not contribute to programmed cell death.

p53 does not contribute to p73-induced autophagy. for
induction of cell death in certain systems, cooperativity
between p53 family members has been shown to be
important. we considered therefore whether the ability of
p73 to induce autophagy in cell types containing wild-type
p53, may be at
least partially dependent on p53. we
therefore analysed the ability of ta-p73 to induce
autophagy in u2os cells, which like saos2 cells are from
an osteosarcoma, but unlike saos2, contain wild-type p53.
similar to what we observed in saos2 cells (figure 1),
infection of u2os cells with an adenovirus expressing ta-
p73 caused a marked increase in gfp-lc3 puncta
(figure 7a). to test if this effect was in any way dependent
on p53, we infected these cells with a shrna to knockdown
p5334 (figure 7b). these cells and cells infected with a non-
silencing shrna as control were then infected with
adenoviral ta-p73 and gfp-lc3. this revealed however
that knockdown of p53 had no effect on the ability of p73 to
induce autophagy (figure 7c).

autophagy per se and whether dn-p73 could modulate the
induction of autophagy in a negative manner. to test this,
saos2 cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing dn-
p73 and gfp-lc3. unlike ta-p73 (figure 1) or amino-acid
starvation, dn-p73 does not cause accumulation of
autophagosomes (figure 6a). however, dn-p73 was able
to repress the formation of autophagosomes induced by p53
or ta-p73 (figure 6b–e), indicating that although p73-driven
autophagy may not be dependent on dram, it is likely to be
dependent on other target gene(s) of ta-p73. in contrast dn-
p73 had no effect on starvation-induced autophagy. this
implies three independent autophagy signalling pathways:

and
to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report which shows that p73
can modulate autophagy. it therefore introduces yet another
regulator of this process that has also been shown to control
cell viability. our previous studies and those of others have
reported that p53 can modulate autophagy.11,12 it is perhaps,
therefore, no surprise that its closely related family member,
p73, can also do so. it is intriguing, however, to ﬁnd that
the mechanism by which autophagy is regulated by p73 is
different to that of p53. p53’s regulation of autophagy is
critically dependent on the activation of
its target gene,
dram.12 although dram is directly activated by p73, it
appears that it is dispensable for p73 to modulate autophagy.
p53 has also been shown to modulate autophagy by signalling
through the nutrient-sensing kinase, mtor.11 whether this
signal is upstream or downstream of dram, or for that matter
completely independent
it would be
intriguing to assess if p73 can affect mtor activity and
whether this is involved in the regulation of autophagy by p73.
it is also entirely possible that another p73 target gene, distinct
from dram, may mediate p73-induced autophagy and our
studies with dn-p73 would indicate that this is likely. the
identiﬁcation of such a target gene(s) and an assessment of
whether this is also a target of p53 would undoubtedly be very
rewarding.
is as yet unknown.
we also report that the regulation of autophagy by p73 does
not contribute to p73-mediated programmed cell death. this is
clearly an important functional difference between p53 and
p73 and it is tempting to speculate that this may underlie
critical fundamental differences between the two proteins in,
for example, tumour suppression. what then is the role of
autophagy downstream of p73? clearly, we cannot comple-
tely rule-out the possibility that autophagy induced by p73 may
contribute to cell death in some situations. for example, it
is possible that under nutrient-deprived conditions, where
autophagy is a critical regulator of cell viability,
the
autophagy induced by p73 may be important. this would be
an intriguing possibility regardless of whether autophagy
under these conditions promotes cell death or cell survival.

figure 5 autophagy is not required for p73-induced apoptosis. teton-p53 (a, c, e) and teton-ta-p73g (b, d, f) cells were transfected with control or atg5-speciﬁc
sirnas for a total of 72 h. the relative levels of atg5 were assessed by real-time pcr after 24 h induction with dox (a and b). the effects on autophagy were assessed after
48 h induction with dox by measuring the ratio of gfp-lc3i to gfp-lc3ii by western blotting (c and d) and the effects on apoptosis determined by ﬂow cytometry (e, f).
apoptosis was measured by the % sub-g1 content of the cells. cont., non-targeting control sirna
aside from a role in controlling cell viability during tumour
development or starvation conditions, it may also be possible
that p73 regulates autophagy to serve a completely different
purpose in a very speciﬁc context. one notable difference
between p53 and p73 is the role of p73 in development.24,25
autophagy has been shown to have roles in cell death
regulation and also tissue remodelling during development
and it may well be that it is during development that p73’s
effects on autophagy play a role.
our studies also raise questions about dram’s role
downstream of p73. dram induction appears to play no role
in the regulation of autophagy or programmed cell death by
cell death and differentiation

figure 6 dn-p73 regulates p53- and p73-driven autophagy, but does induce autophagy itself and does not inhibit starvation-driven autophagy. (a) dn-p73 cells do not
exhibit accumulation of autophagosomes following infection with gfp-lc3. (b–g) expression of dn-p73 impedes the ability of p53 and p73 to induce accumulation of
autophagosomes, but does not affect starvation-induced autophagy. accumulation of gfp-lc3 puncta was assayed by microscopy and quantiﬁed (b, d, f) and transgene
expression was determined by western blotting (c, e, g). cont., control ‘empty’ adenovirus
p73 under the conditions tested. as with the role of autophagy
downstream of p73, it may well be that dram contributes to
p73 function, perhaps, even to p73-mediated programmed
cell death, in a speciﬁc context. it may be for example, as
dram is only strongly activated by p73g, that dram has
speciﬁc functions in cells that express relatively large amounts
of this p73 isoform. equally, it still remains possible that
although knockdown of dram does not affect p73’s ability to
modulate autophagy, it may be that the basal, or knockdown,
levels of dram contribute to autophagy regulation in
combination with other p73-induced genes. the generation
of knockout cells/mice would clearly help resolve this issue.
ultimately, however, the function of dram per se requires
further
investigation before these issues can really be
addressed. although the speciﬁc function of dram is
unknown, its lysosomal localization would indicate likely roles
in either trafﬁcking through the secretory pathway or in the
degradation of proteins that are delivered to the lysosome. it
is possible that speciﬁc cellular stresses that target these
processes elicit a p73-dependent response where dram is
critical. it is clear, therefore, that further studies are required to
elucidate what
role dram and indeed autophagy play
downstream of p73 and how this relates to the differences in
function between p53 and p73.

plasmids. pshuttlecmv-ha-tap73a and pshuttlecmv-ha-dnp73a were
created by cloning ha-tap73a and ha-dnp73a fragments from pcdna3-ha
vectors (kindly donated by gerry melino) into pshuttlecmv (kindly provided by bert
vogelstein)35 using kpni and xhoi
restriction enzymes. pretrosuper-scr,
pretrosuper-p53 and pretrosuper-p73,12,32 pcdna3-p53, pcdna3-ha-

pbabepuro-p73-er was generated by fusing coding sequences of p73 to the
hormone-binding domain of the oestrogen receptor as described previously.33 the
p73-er fusion was then subsequently cloned into pbabepuro.
cell culture and transfetions. saos2, u2os and h1299 cells can all be
obtained from atcc. teton-p53, teton-73a, teton-p73b and tetonp73g cells are
saos2-derived lines and have been described previously.28,37 saos2-prs-scr and
saos2-prs-p73 were generated by infection with pretrosuper-scr (prs-scr)
and pretrosuper-p73 (prs-p73). u2os-prs-scr and u2os-prs-p53 were
generated by infection of u2os cells with pretrosuper-scr (prs-scr) and
pretrosuper-p53 (prs-p53), respectively. h1299-p73-er cells were generated
by infection with pbabepuro-p73-er. all retrovirally infected cells were undertaken
infected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml
as previously described38 and all
puromycin (sigma). all cell lines were maintained in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum.
transgene
expression was achieved by addition of 1 mg/ml doxyclycline (dox) (sigma). for
starvation conditions, cells were incubated in earle’s balanced salt solution (ebss)
(sigma). where indicated, cells were transfected by capo4 precipitation as
previously described.39

plasmids were
electroporated into bj5183-ad-1 electro-competent cells (stratagene) containing
the adeasy-1 adenoviral construct. recombinant plasmids were then ampliﬁed in
xl10-gold cells (stratagene) and transfected into hek293 cells after restriction
digest with paci. following ampliﬁcation in 293 cells, puriﬁed adenovirus was
isolated by freeze-thaw extraction and titred using the bd bioscience adeno-x
rapid titer kit. adenoviruses were added to cultures at a concentration of 12
infectious units per cell.
long-lived protein degradation assays. teton-p73 cells were labelled
for 6 h with l-[35s]met/cys (5 mci/ml) (amersham), washed three times in pbs and
incubated for a further 16 h in dmem supplemented with 2 mm unlabelled l-met/cys
plus dox where indicated. the degradation period was started by washing the cells
again and replacing with fresh medium or ebss. after 4 h, the levels of degraded
protein were calculated as previously described.18
cell death assays. total populations of cells, including ﬂoating and adherent
cells, were processed for ﬂow cytometric analysis (facscan, becton dickinson) as
described previously.40 acquired events were analysed with cellquest software
(becton dickinson). the percentage of cells with a sub-g1 dna content was taken
as a measure of the extent of apoptosis in the cell population at that time.
luciferase reporter assays. saos2 cells were transfected with 5 mg of
dram-luc, and 0.5 mg of pcdna3-p53, pcdna-p73 or empty vector. 24 h later,
cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. samples were assayed for luciferase activity.
western blotting. cells were lysed in a 2 western sample buffer and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously.39 membranes
were probed using standard immunoblotting techniques with antibodies that
recognize p73 (hrp-conjugated ha, roche), p53 (do-1, pharmingen), p21 (sc-
397g, santa cruz) and actin (clone 1a4, sigma).
immunoﬂuoresence. for analysis of autophagosomes, cells were infected
with an adenovirus expressing gfp-lc3 (a kind gift
from aviva tolkovsky,
university of cambridge).29 sixteen hours later, cells were incubated either in the
absence of presence of dox. after a further 24 h, cells were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% triton. cells were then stained with
antibodies that recognize exogenous p73 (ha – clone 12ca5, roche) or p53 (do-1,

pharmingen). following incubation with a texas red-conjugated secondary
antibody (molecular probes inc.), cells were analysed by confocal microsopy.
electron microscopy. following treatments, cells were ﬁxed with 2%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and transmission electron microscopy
performed using standard techniques.
quantitative rt-pcr. rna was prepared using trizol reagent (invitrogen).
qpcr analysis was undertaken using the dynamo sybr green 2-step qrt-pcr
kit (finnzymes). data collection was carried out using a chromo4 real-time pcr
detector and analysed with opticon monitor 3. primers for dram and 18s have
